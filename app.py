Brilliant college kids sitting\nin a dorm are inventing the future.\nHeedless of boundaries, possessed of\nnew technology and youthful\nenthusiasm, they build a new\ncompany from scratch. Their early\nsuccess allows them to raise money\nand bring an amazing new product to\nmarket. They hire their friends,\nassemble a superstar team, and dare\nthe world to stop them.\nTen years and several startups\nago, that was me, building my first\ncompany. I particularly remember a\nmoment from back then: the moment\nI realized my company was going to\nfail. My cofounder and I were at our\nwits’ end. The dot-com bubble had\nburst, and we had spent all our\nmoney. We tried desperately to raise\nmore capital, and we could not. It\nwas like a breakup scene from a\nHollywood movie: it was raining,\nand we were arguing in the street.\nWe couldn’t even agree on where to\nwalk next, and so we parted in anger,\nheading in opposite directions. As a\nmetaphor for our company’s failure,\nthis image of the two of us, lost in\nthe rain and drifting apart, is perfect.\nIt remains a painful memory. The\ncompany limped along for months\nafterward, but our situation was\nhopeless. At the time, it had seemed\nwe were doing everything right: we\nhad a great product, a brilliant team,\namazing technology, and the right\nidea at the right time. And we really\nwere on to something. We were\nbuilding a way for college kids to\ncreate online profiles for the purpose\nof sharing … with employers. Oops.\nBut despite a promising idea, we\nwere nonetheless doomed from day\none, because we did not know the\nprocess we would need to use to turn\nour product insights into a great\ncompany.\nIf you’ve never experienced a\nfailure like this, it is hard to describe\nthe feeling. It’s as if the world were\nfalling out from under you. You\nrealize you’ve been duped. The\nstories in the magazines are lies:\nhard work and perseverance don’t\nlead to success. Even worse, the\nmany, many, many promises you’ve\nmade to employees, friends, and\nfamily are not going to come true.\nEveryone who thought you were\nfoolish for stepping out on your own\nwill be proven right.\nIt wasn’t supposed to turn out that\nway. In magazines and newspapers,\nin blockbuster movies, and on\ncountless blogs, we hear the mantra\nof the successful entrepreneurs:\nthrough determination, brilliance,\ngreat timing, and—above all—a\ngreat product, you too can achieve\nfame and fortune.\nThere is a mythmaking industry\nhard at work to sell us that story, but\nI have come to believe that the story\nis false, the product of selection bias\nand after-the-fact rationalization. In\nfact, having worked with hundreds of\nentrepreneurs, I have seen firsthand\nhow often a promising start leads to\nfailure. The grim reality is that most\nstartups fail. Most new products are\nnot successful. Most new ventures\ndo not live up to their potential.\nYet the story of perseverance,\ncreative genius, and hard work\npersists. Why is it so popular? I think\nthere is something deeply appealing\nabout this modern-day rags-to-riches\nstory. It makes success seem\ninevitable if you just have the right\nstuff. It means that the mundane\ndetails, the boring stuff, the small\nindividual choices don’t matter. If\nwe build it, they will come. When\nwe fail, as so many of us do, we have\na ready-made excuse: we didn’t have\nthe right stuff. We weren’t visionary\nenough or weren’t in the right place\nat the right time.\nAfter more than ten years as an\nentrepreneur, I came to reject that\nline of thinking. I have learned from\nboth my own successes and failures\nand those of many others that it’s the\nboring stuff that matters the most.\nStartup success is not a consequence\nof good genes or being in the right\nplace at the right time. Startup\nsuccess can be engineered by\nfollowing the right process, which\nmeans it can be learned, which\nmeans it can be taught.\nEntrepreneurship is a kind of\nmanagement. No, you didn’t read\nthat wrong. We have wildly\ndivergent associations with these two\nw o r d s , entrepreneurship and\nmanagement. Lately, it seems that\none is cool, innovative, and exciting\nand the other is dull, serious, and\nbland. It is time to look past these\npreconceptions.\nLet me tell you a second startup\nstory. It’s 2004, and a group of\nfounders have just started a new\ncompany. Their previous company\nhad failed very publicly. Their\ncredibility is at an all-time low. They\nhave a huge vision: to change the\nway people communicate by using a\nnew technology called avatars\n(remember, this was before James\nCameron’s blockbuster movie). They\nare following a visionary named Will\nHarvey, who paints a compelling\npicture: people connecting with their\nfriends, hanging out online, using\navatars to give them a combination\nof intimate connection and safe\nanonymity. Even better, instead of\nhaving to build all the clothing,\nfurniture, and accessories these\navatars would need to accessorize\ntheir digital lives, the customers\nwould be enlisted to build those\nthings and sell them to one another.\nThe engineering challenge before\nthem is immense: creating virtual\nworlds, user-generated content, an\nonline commerce engine,\nmicropayments, and—last but not\nleast—the three-dimensional avatar\ntechnology that can run on anyone’s\nPC.\nI’m in this second story, too. I’m a\ncofounder and chief technology\nofficer of this company, which is\ncalled IMVU. At this point in our\ncareers, my cofounders and I are\ndetermined to make new mistakes.\nWe do everything wrong: instead of\nspending years perfecting our\ntechnology, we build a minimum\nviable product, an early product that\nis terrible, full of bugs and crashyour-computer-yes-really stability\nproblems. Then we ship it to\ncustomers way before it’s ready. And\nwe charge money for it. After\nsecuring initial customers, we\nchange the product constantly—\nmuch too fast by traditional\nstandards—shipping new versions of\nour product dozens of times every\nsingle day.\nWe really did have customers in\nthose early days—true visionary\nearly adopters—and we often talked\nto them and asked for their feedback.\nBut we emphatically did not do what\nthey said. We viewed their input as\nonly one source of information about\nour product and overall vision. In\nfact, we were much more likely to\nrun experiments on our customers\nthan we were to cater to their whims.\nTraditional business thinking says\nthat this approach shouldn’t work,\nbut it does, and you don’t have to\ntake my word for it. As you’ll see\nthroughout this book, the approach\nwe pioneered at IMVU has become\nthe basis for a new movement of\nentrepreneurs around the world. It\nbuilds on many previous\nmanagement and product\ndevelopment ideas, including lean\nmanufacturing, design thinking,\ncustomer development, and agile\ndevelopment. It represents a new\napproach to creating continuous\ninnovation. It’s called the Lean\nStartup.\nDespite the volumes written on\nbusiness strategy, the key attributes\nof business leaders, and ways to\nidentify the next big thing,\ninnovators still struggle to bring their\nideas to life. This was the frustration\nthat led us to try a radical new\napproach at IMVU, one\ncharacterized by an extremely fast\ncycle time, a focus on what\ncustomers want (without asking\nthem), and a scientific approach to\nmaking decisions.\nORIGINS OF THE LEAN\nSTARTUP\nI am one of those people who grew\nup programming computers, and so\nmy journey to thinking about\nentrepreneurship and management\nhas taken a circuitous path. I have\nalways worked on the product\ndevelopment side of my industry; my\npartners and bosses were managers\nor marketers, and my peers worked\nin engineering and operations.\nThroughout my career, I kept having\nthe experience of working incredibly\nhard on products that ultimately\nfailed in the marketplace.\nAt first, largely because of my\nbackground, I viewed these as\ntechnical problems that required\ntechnical solutions: better\narchitecture, a better engineering\nprocess, better discipline, focus, or\nproduct vision. These supposed fixes\nled to still more failure. So I read\neverything I could get my hands on\nand was blessed to have had some of\nthe top minds in Silicon Valley as\nmy mentors. By the time I became a\ncofounder of IMVU, I was hungry\nfor new ideas about how to build a\ncompany.\nI was fortunate to have cofounders\nwho were willing to experiment with\nnew approaches. They were fed up—\nas I was—by the failure of traditional\nthinking. Also, we were lucky to\nhave Steve Blank as an investor and\nadviser. Back in 2004, Steve had just\nbegun preaching a new idea: the\nbusiness and marketing functions of\na startup should be considered as\nimportant as engineering and product\ndevelopment and therefore deserve\nan equally rigorous methodology to\nguide them. He called that\nmethodology Customer\nDevelopment, and it offered insight\nand guidance to my daily work as an\nentrepreneur.\nMeanwhile, I was building\nIMVU’s product development team,\nusing some of the unorthodox\nmethods I mentioned earlier.\nMeasured against the traditional\ntheories of product development I\nhad been trained on in my career,\nthese methods did not make sense,\nyet I could see firsthand that they\nwere working. I struggled to explain\nthe practices to new employees,\ninvestors, and the founders of other\ncompanies. We lacked a common\nlanguage for describing them and\nconcrete principles for understanding\nthem.\nI began to search outside\nentrepreneurship for ideas that could\nhelp me make sense of my\nexperience. I began to study other\nindustries, especially manufacturing,\nfrom which most modern theories of\nmanagement derive. I studied lean\nmanufacturing, a process that\noriginated in Japan with the Toyota\nProduction System, a completely\nnew way of thinking about the\nmanufacturing of physical goods. I\nfound that by applying ideas from\nlean manufacturing to my own\nentrepreneurial challenges—with a\nfew tweaks and changes—I had the\nbeginnings of a framework for\nmaking sense of them.\nThis line of thought evolved into\nthe Lean Startup: the application of\nlean thinking to the process of\ninnovation.\nIMVU became a tremendous\nsuccess. IMVU customers have\ncreated more than 60 million avatars.\nIt is a profitable company with\nannual revenues of more than $50\nmillion in 2011, employing more\nthan a hundred people in our current\noffices in Mountain View,\nCalifornia. IMVU’s virtual goods\ncatalog—which seemed so risky\nyears ago—now has more than 6\nmillion items in it; more than 7,000\nare added every day, almost all\ncreated by customers.\nAs a result of IMVU’s success, I\nbegan to be asked for advice by other\nstartups and venture capitalists.\nWhen I would describe my\nexperiences at IMVU, I was often\nmet with blank stares or extreme\nskepticism. The most common reply\nwas “That could never work!” My\nexperience so flew in the face of\nconventional thinking that most\npeople, even in the innovation hub of\nSilicon Valley, could not wrap their\nminds around it.\nThen I started to write, first on a\nblog called Startup Lessons Learned,\nand speak—at conferences and to\ncompanies, startups, and venture\ncapitalists—to anyone who would\nlisten. In the process of being called\non to defend and explain my insights\nand with the collaboration of other\nwriters, thinkers, and entrepreneurs, I\nhad a chance to refine and develop\nthe theory of the Lean Startup\nbeyond its rudimentary beginnings.\nMy hope all along was to find ways\nto eliminate the tremendous waste I\nsaw all around me: startups that built\nproducts nobody wanted, new\nproducts pulled from the shelves,\ncountless dreams unrealized.\nEventually, the Lean Startup idea\nblossomed into a global movement.\nEntrepreneurs began forming local\nin-person groups to discuss and\napply Lean Startup ideas. There are\nnow organized communities of\npractice in more than a hundred\ncities around the world.1 My travels\nhave taken me across countries and\ncontinents. Everywhere I have seen\nthe signs of a new entrepreneurial\nrenaissance. The Lean Startup\nmovement is making\nentrepreneurship accessible to a\nwhole new generation of founders\nwho are hungry for new ideas about\nhow to build successful companies.\nAlthough my background is in\nhigh-tech software entrepreneurship,\nthe movement has grown way\nbeyond those roots. Thousands of\nentrepreneurs are putting Lean\nStartup principles to work in every\nconceivable industry. I’ve had the\nchance to work with entrepreneurs in\ncompanies of all sizes, in different\nindustries, and even in government.\nThis journey has taken me to places I\nnever imagined I’d see, from the\nworld’s most elite venture capitalists,\nto Fortune 500 boardrooms, to the\nPentagon. The most nervous I have\never been in a meeting was when I\nwas attempting to explain Lean\nStartup principles to the chief\ninformation officer of the U.S. Army,\nwho is a three-star general (for the\nrecord, he was extremely open to\nnew ideas, even from a civilian like\nme).\nPretty soon I realized that it was\ntime to focus on the Lean Startup\nmovement full time. My mission: to\nimprove the success rate of new\ninnovative products worldwide. The\nresult is the book you are reading.\nTHE LEAN STARTUP METHOD\nThis is a book for entrepreneurs and\nthe people who hold them\naccountable. The five principles of\nthe Lean Startup, which inform all\nthree parts of this book, are as\nfollows:\n1. Entrepreneurs are\neverywhere. You don’t have to work\nin a garage to be in a startup. The\nconcept of entrepreneurship includes\nanyone who works within my\ndefinition of a startup: a human\ninstitution designed to create new\nproducts and services under\nconditions of extreme uncertainty.\nThat means entrepreneurs are\neverywhere and the Lean Startup\napproach can work in any size\ncompany, even a very large\nenterprise, in any sector or industry.\n2. Entrepreneurship is\nmanagement. A startup is an\ninstitution, not just a product, and so\nit requires a new kind of\nmanagement specifically geared to\nits context of extreme uncertainty. In\nfact, as I will argue later, I believe\n“entrepreneur” should be considered\na job title in all modern companies\nthat depend on innovation for their\nfuture growth.\n3. Validated learning. Startups\nexist not just to make stuff, make\nmoney, or even serve customers.\nThey exist to learn how to build a\nsustainable business. This learning\ncan be validated scientifically by\nrunning frequent experiments that\nallow entrepreneurs to test each\nelement of their vision.\n4. Build-Measure-Learn. The\nfundamental activity of a startup is to\nturn ideas into products, measure\nhow customers respond, and then\nlearn whether to pivot or persevere.\nAll successful startup processes\nshould be geared to accelerate that\nfeedback loop.\n5. Innovation accounting. To\nimprove entrepreneurial outcomes\nand hold innovators accountable, we\nneed to focus on the boring stuff:\nhow to measure progress, how to set\nup milestones, and how to prioritize\nwork. This requires a new kind of\naccounting designed for startups—\nand the people who hold them\naccountable.\nWhy Startups Fail\nWhy are startups failing so badly\neverywhere we look?\nThe first problem is the allure of a\ngood plan, a solid strategy, and\nthorough market research. In earlier\neras, these things were indicators of\nlikely success. The overwhelming\ntemptation is to apply them to\nstartups too, but this doesn’t work,\nbecause startups operate with too\nmuch uncertainty. Startups do not yet\nknow who their customer is or what\ntheir product should be. As the world\nbecomes more uncertain, it gets\nharder and harder to predict the\nfuture. The old management methods\nare not up to the task. Planning and\nforecasting are only accurate when\nbased on a long, stable operating\nhistory and a relatively static\nenvironment. Startups have neither.\nThe second problem is that after\nseeing traditional management fail to\nsolve this problem, some\nentrepreneurs and investors have\nthrown up their hands and adopted\nthe “Just Do It” school of startups.\nThis school believes that if\nmanagement is the problem, chaos is\nthe answer. Unfortunately, as I can\nattest firsthand, this doesn’t work\neither.\nIt may seem counterintuitive to\nthink that something as disruptive,\ninnovative, and chaotic as a startup\ncan be managed or, to be accurate,\nmust be managed. Most people think\nof process and management as\nboring and dull, whereas startups are\ndynamic and exciting. But what is\nactually exciting is to see startups\nsucceed and change the world. The\npassion, energy, and vision that\npeople bring to these new ventures\nare resources too precious to waste.\nWe can—and must—do better. This\nbook is about how.\nHOW THIS BOOK IS\nORGANIZED\nThis book is divided into three parts:\n“Vision,” “Steer,” and “Accelerate.”\n“Vision” makes the case for a new\ndiscipline of entrepreneurial\nmanagement. I identify who is an\nentrepreneur, define a startup, and\narticulate a new way for startups to\ngauge if they are making progress,\ncalled validated learning. To achieve\nthat learning, we’ll see that startups\n—in a garage or inside an enterprise\n—can use scientific experimentation\nto discover how to build a\nsustainable business.\n“Steer” dives into the Lean Startup\nmethod in detail, showing one major\nturn through the core Build-MeasureLearn feedback loop. Beginning with\nleap-of-faith assumptions that cry out\nfor rigorous testing, you’ll learn how\nto build a minimum viable product to\ntest those assumptions, a new\naccounting system for evaluating\nwhether you’re making progress, and\na method for deciding whether to\npivot (changing course with one foot\nanchored to the ground) or persevere.\nIn “Accelerate,” we’ll explore\ntechniques that enable Lean Startups\nto speed through the Build-MeasureLearn feedback loop as quickly as\npossible, even as they scale. We’ll\nexplore lean manufacturing concepts\nthat are applicable to startups, too,\nsuch as the power of small batches.\nWe’ll also discuss organizational\ndesign, how products grow, and how\nto apply Lean Startup principles\nbeyond the proverbial garage, even\ninside the world’s largest companies.\nMANAGEMENT’S SECOND\nCENTURY\nAs a society, we have a proven set of\ntechniques for managing big\ncompanies and we know the best\npractices for building physical\nproducts. But when it comes to\nstartups and innovation, we are still\nshooting in the dark. We are relying\non vision, chasing the “great men”\nwho can make magic happen, or\ntrying to analyze our new products to\ndeath. These are new problems, born\nof the success of management in the\ntwentieth century.\nThis book attempts to put\nentrepreneurship and innovation on a\nrigorous footing. We are at the dawn\nof management’s second century. It\nis our challenge to do something\ngreat with the opportunity we have\nbeen given. The Lean Startup\nmovement seeks to ensure that those\nof us who long to build the next big\nthing will have the tools we need to\nchange the world.\nPart One\nVISION\n1\nSTART\nENTREPRENEURIAL\nMANAGEMENT\nBuilding a startup is an exercise in\ninstitution building; thus, it\nnecessarily involves management.\nThis often comes as a surprise to\naspiring entrepreneurs, because their\nassociations with these two words\nare so diametrically opposed.\nEntrepreneurs are rightly wary of\nimplementing traditional\nmanagement practices early on in a\nstartup, afraid that they will invite\nbureaucracy or stifle creativity.\nEntrepreneurs have been trying to\nfit the square peg of their unique\nproblems into the round hole of\ngeneral management for decades. As\na result, many entrepreneurs take a\n“just do it” attitude, avoiding all\nforms of management, process, and\ndiscipline. Unfortunately, this\napproach leads to chaos more often\nthan it does to success. I should\nknow: my first startup failures were\nall of this kind.\nThe tremendous success of\ngeneral management over the last\ncentury has provided unprecedented\nmaterial abundance, but those\nmanagement principles are ill suited\nto handle the chaos and uncertainty\nthat startups must face.\nI believe that entrepreneurship\nrequires a managerial discipline to\nharness the entrepreneurial\nopportunity we have been given.\nThere are more entrepreneurs\noperating today than at any previous\ntime in history. This has been made\npossible by dramatic changes in the\nglobal economy. To cite but one\nexample, one often hears\ncommentators lament the loss of\nmanufacturing jobs in the United\nStates over the previous two\ndecades, but one rarely hears about a\ncorresponding loss of manufacturing\ncapability. That’s because total\nmanufacturing output in the United\nStates is increasing (by 15 percent in\nthe last decade) even as jobs\ncontinue to be lost (see the charts\nbelow). In effect, the huge\nproductivity increases made possible\nby modern management and\ntechnology have created more\nproductive capacity than firms know\nwhat to do with.1\nWe are living through an\nunprecedented worldwide\nentrepreneurial renaissance, but this\nopportunity is laced with peril.\nBecause we lack a coherent\nmanagement paradigm for new\ninnovative ventures, we’re throwing\nour excess capacity around with wild\nabandon. Despite this lack of rigor,\nwe are finding some ways to make\nmoney, but for every success there\nare far too many failures: products\npulled from shelves mere weeks after\nbeing launched, high-profile startups\nlauded in the press and forgotten a\nfew months later, and new products\nthat wind up being used by nobody.\nWhat makes these failures\nparticularly painful is not just the\neconomic damage done to individual\nemployees, companies, and\ninvestors; they are also a colossal\nwaste of our civilization’s most\nprecious resource: the time, passion,\nand skill of its people. The Lean\nStartup movement is dedicated to\npreventing these failures.\n\n\n\nTHE ROOTS OF THE LEAN\nSTARTUP\nThe Lean Startup takes its name\nfrom the lean manufacturing\nrevolution that Taiichi Ohno and\nShigeo Shingo are credited with\ndeveloping at Toyota. Lean thinking\nis radically altering the way supply\nchains and production systems are\nrun. Among its tenets are drawing on\nthe knowledge and creativity of\nindividual workers, the shrinking of\nbatch sizes, just-in-time production\nand inventory control, and an\nacceleration of cycle times. It taught\nthe world the difference between\nvalue-creating activities and waste\nand showed how to build quality into\nproducts from the inside out.\nThe Lean Startup adapts these\nideas to the context of\nentrepreneurship, proposing that\nentrepreneurs judge their progress\ndifferently from the way other kinds\nof ventures do. Progress in\nmanufacturing is measured by the\nproduction of high-quality physical\ngoods. As we’ll see in Chapter 3, the\nLean Startup uses a different unit of\nprogress, called validated learning.\nW i t h scientific learning as our\nyardstick, we can discover and\neliminate the sources of waste that\nare plaguing entrepreneurship.\nA comprehensive theory of\nentrepreneurship should address all\nthe functions of an early-stage\nventure: vision and concept, product\ndevelopment, marketing and sales,\nscaling up, partnerships and\ndistribution, and structure and\norganizational design. It has to\nprovide a method for measuring\nprogress in the context of extreme\nuncertainty. It can give entrepreneurs\nclear guidance on how to make the\nmany trade-off decisions they face:\nwhether and when to invest in\nprocess; formulating, planning, and\ncreating infrastructure; when to go it\nalone and when to partner; when to\nrespond to feedback and when to\nstick with vision; and how and when\nto invest in scaling the business.\nMost of all, it must allow\nentrepreneurs to make testable\npredictions.\nFor example, consider the\nrecommendation that you build\ncross-functional teams and hold them\naccountable to what we call learning\nmilestones instead of organizing your\ncompany into strict functional\ndepartments (marketing, sales,\ninformation technology, human\nresources, etc.) that hold people\naccountable for performing well in\ntheir specialized areas (see Chapter\n7). Perhaps you agree with this\nrecommendation, or perhaps you are\nskeptical. Either way, if you decide\nto implement it, I predict that you\npretty quickly will get feedback from\nyour teams that the new process is\nreducing their productivity. They\nwill ask to go back to the old way of\nworking, in which they had the\nopportunity to “stay efficient” by\nworking in larger batches and\npassing work between departments.\nIt’s safe to predict this result, and\nnot just because I have seen it many\ntimes in the companies I work with.\nIt is a straightforward prediction of\nthe Lean Startup theory itself. When\npeople are used to evaluating their\nproductivity locally, they feel that a\ngood day is one in which they did\ntheir job well all day. When I worked\nas a programmer, that meant eight\nstraight hours of programming\nwithout interruption. That was a\ngood day. In contrast, if I was\ninterrupted with questions, process,\nor—heaven forbid—meetings, I felt\nbad. What did I really accomplish\nthat day? Code and product features\nwere tangible to me; I could see\nthem, understand them, and show\nthem off. Learning, by contrast, is\nfrustratingly intangible.\nThe Lean Startup asks people to\nstart measuring their productivity\ndifferently. Because startups often\naccidentally build something nobody\nwants, it doesn’t matter much if they\ndo it on time and on budget. The goal\nof a startup is to figure out the right\nthing to build—the thing customers\nwant and will pay for—as quickly as\npossible. In other words, the Lean\nStartup is a new way of looking at\nthe development of innovative new\nproducts that emphasizes fast\niteration and customer insight, a\nhuge vision, and great ambition, all\nat the same time.\nHenry Ford is one of the most\nsuccessful and celebrated\nentrepreneurs of all time. Since the\nidea of management has been bound\nup with the history of the automobile\nsince its first days, I believe it is\nfitting to use the automobile as a\nmetaphor for a startup.\nAn internal combustion\nautomobile is powered by two\nimportant and very different\nfeedback loops. The first feedback\nloop is deep inside the engine.\nBefore Henry Ford was a famous\nCEO, he was an engineer. He spent\nhis days and nights tinkering in his\ngarage with the precise mechanics of\ngetting the engine cylinders to move.\nEach tiny explosion within the\ncylinder provides the motive force to\nturn the wheels but also drives the\nignition of the next explosion. Unless\nthe timing of this feedback loop is\nmanaged precisely, the engine will\nsputter and break down.\nStartups have a similar engine that\nI call the engine of growth. The\nmarkets and customers for startups\nare diverse: a toy company, a\nconsulting firm, and a manufacturing\nplant may not seem like they have\nmuch in common, but, as we’ll see,\nthey operate with the same engine of\ngrowth.\nEvery new version of a product,\nevery new feature, and every new\nmarketing program is an attempt to\nimprove this engine of growth. Like\nHenry Ford’s tinkering in his garage,\nnot all of these changes turn out to be\nimprovements. New product\ndevelopment happens in fits and\nstarts. Much of the time in a startup’s\nlife is spent tuning the engine by\nmaking improvements in product,\nmarketing, or operations.\nThe second important feedback\nloop in an automobile is between the\ndriver and the steering wheel. This\nfeedback is so immediate and\nautomatic that we often don’t think\nabout it, but it is steering that\ndifferentiates driving from most\nother forms of transportation. If you\nhave a daily commute, you probably\nknow the route so well that your\nhands seem to steer you there on\ntheir own accord. We can practically\ndrive the route in our sleep. Yet if I\nasked you to close your eyes and\nwrite down exactly how to get to\nyour office—not the street directions\nbut every action you need to take,\nevery push of hand on wheel and\nfoot on pedals—you’d find it\nimpossible. The choreography of\ndriving is incredibly complex when\none slows down to think about it.\nBy contrast, a rocket ship requires\njust this kind of in-advance\ncalibration. It must be launched with\nthe most precise instructions on what\nto do: every thrust, every firing of a\nbooster, and every change in\ndirection. The tiniest error at the\npoint of launch could yield\ncatastrophic results thousands of\nmiles later.\nUnfortunately, too many startup\nbusiness plans look more like they\nare planning to launch a rocket ship\nthan drive a car. They prescribe the\nsteps to take and the results to expect\nin excruciating detail, and as in\nplanning to launch a rocket, they are\nset up in such a way that even tiny\nerrors in assumptions can lead to\ncatastrophic outcomes.\nOne company I worked with had\nthe misfortune of forecasting\nsignificant customer adoption—in\nthe millions—for one of its new\nproducts. Powered by a splashy\nlaunch, the company successfully\nexecuted its plan. Unfortunately,\ncustomers did not flock to the\nproduct in great numbers. Even\nworse, the company had invested in\nmassive infrastructure, hiring, and\nsupport to handle the influx of\ncustomers it expected. When the\ncustomers failed to materialize, the\ncompany had committed itself so\ncompletely that they could not adapt\nin time. They had “achieved\nfailure”—successfully, faithfully,\nand rigorously executing a plan that\nturned out to have been utterly\nflawed.\nThe Lean Startup method, in\ncontrast, is designed to teach you\nhow to drive a startup. Instead of\nmaking complex plans that are based\non a lot of assumptions, you can\nmake constant adjustments with a\nsteering wheel called the BuildMeasure-Learn feedback loop.\nThrough this process of steering, we\ncan learn when and if it’s time to\nmake a sharp turn called a pivot or\nwhether we should persevere along\nour current path. Once we have an\nengine that’s revved up, the Lean\nStartup offers methods to scale and\ngrow the business with maximum\nacceleration.\nThroughout the process of driving,\nyou always have a clear idea of\nwhere you’re going. If you’re\ncommuting to work, you don’t give\nup because there’s a detour in the\nroad or you made a wrong turn. You\nremain thoroughly focused on\ngetting to your destination.\nStartups also have a true north, a\ndestination in mind: creating a\nthriving and world-changing\nbusiness. I call that a startup’s vision.\nTo achieve that vision, startups\nemploy a strategy, which includes a\nbusiness model, a product road map,\na point of view about partners and\ncompetitors, and ideas about who the\ncustomer will be. The product is the\nend result of this strategy (see the\nchart on this page).\nProducts change constantly\nthrough the process of optimization,\nwhat I call tuning the engine. Less\nfrequently, the strategy may have to\nchange (called a pivot). However,\nthe overarching vision rarely\nchanges. Entrepreneurs are\ncommitted to seeing the startup\nthrough to that destination. Every\nsetback is an opportunity for learning\nhow to get where they want to go\n(see the chart below).\nIn real life, a startup is a portfolio\nof activities. A lot is happening\nsimultaneously: the engine is\nrunning, acquiring new customers\nand serving existing ones; we are\ntuning, trying to improve our\nproduct, marketing, and operations;\nand we are steering, deciding if and\nwhen to pivot. The challenge of\nentrepreneurship is to balance all\nthese activities. Even the smallest\nstartup faces the challenge of\nsupporting existing customers while\ntrying to innovate. Even the most\nestablished company faces the\nimperative to invest in innovation\nlest it become obsolete. As\ncompanies grow, what changes is the\nmix of these activities in the\ncompany’s portfolio of work.\nEntrepreneurship is management.\nAnd yet, imagine a modern manager\nwho is tasked with building a new\nproduct in the context of an\nestablished company. Imagine that\nshe goes back to her company’s\nchief financial officer (CFO) a year\nlater and says, “We have failed to\nmeet the growth targets we\npredicted. In fact, we have almost no\nnew customers and no new revenue.\nHowever, we have learned an\nincredible amount and are on the\ncusp of a breakthrough new line of\nbusiness. All we need is another\nyear.” Most of the time, this would\nbe the last report this intrapreneur\nwould give her employer. The reason\nis that in general management, a\nfailure to deliver results is due to\neither a failure to plan adequately or\na failure to execute properly. Both\nare significant lapses, yet new\nproduct development in our modern\neconomy routinely requires exactly\nthis kind of failure on the way to\ngreatness. In the Lean Startup\nmovement, we have come to realize\nthat these internal innovators are\nactually entrepreneurs, too, and that\nentrepreneurial management can\nhelp them succeed; this is the subject\nof the next chapter.\n2\nDEFINE\nWHO, EXACTLY, IS AN\nENTREPRENEUR?\nAs I travel the world talking about\nthe Lean Startup, I’m consistently\nsurprised that I meet people in the\naudience who seem out of place. In\naddition to the more traditional\nstartup entrepreneurs I meet, these\npeople are general managers, mostly\nworking in very large companies,\nwho are tasked with creating new\nventures or product innovations.\nThey are adept at organizational\npolitics: they know how to form\nautonomous divisions with separate\nprofit and loss statements (P&Ls)\nand can shield controversial teams\nfrom corporate meddling. The\nbiggest surprise is that they are\nvisionaries. Like the startup founders\nI have worked with for years, they\ncan see the future of their industries\nand are prepared to take bold risks to\nseek out new and innovative\nsolutions to the problems their\ncompanies face.\nMark, for example, is a manager\nfor an extremely large company who\ncame to one of my lectures. He is the\nleader of a division that recently had\nbeen chartered to bring his company\ninto the twenty-first century by\nbuilding a new suite of products\ndesigned to take advantage of the\nInternet. When he came to talk to me\nafterward, I started to give him the\nstandard advice about how to create\ninnovation teams inside big\ncompanies, and he stopped me in\nmidstream: “Yeah, I’ve read The\nInnovator’s Dilemma.\n1 I’ve got that\nall taken care of.” He was a longterm employee of the company and a\nsuccessful manager to boot, so\nmanaging internal politics was the\nleast of his problems. I should have\nknown; his success was a testament\nto his ability to navigate the\ncompany’s corporate policies,\npersonnel, and processes to get\nthings done.\nNext, I tried to give him some\nadvice about the future, about cool\nnew highly leveraged product\ndevelopment technologies. He\ninterrupted me again: “Right. I know\nall about the Internet, and I have a\nvision for how our company needs to\nadapt to it or die.”\nMark has all the entrepreneurial\nprerequisites nailed—proper team\nstructure, good personnel, a strong\nvision for the future, and an appetite\nfor risk taking—and so it finally\noccurred to me to ask why he was\ncoming to me for advice. He said,\n“It’s as if we have all of the raw\nmaterials: kindling, wood, paper,\nflint, even some sparks. But where’s\nthe fire?” The theories of\nmanagement that Mark had studied\ntreat innovation like a “black box”\nby focusing on the structures\ncompanies need to put in place to\nform internal startup teams. But\nMark found himself working inside\nthe black box—and in need of\nguidance.\nWhat Mark was missing was a\nprocess for converting the raw\nmaterials of innovation into realworld breakthrough successes. Once\na team is set up, what should it do?\nWhat process should it use? How\nshould it be held accountable to\nperformance milestones? These are\nquestions the Lean Startup\nmethodology is designed to answer.\nMy point? Mark is an entrepreneur\njust like a Silicon Valley high-tech\nfounder with a garage startup. He\nneeds the principles of the Lean\nStartup just as much as the folks I\nthought of as classic entrepreneurs\ndo.\nEntrepreneurs who operate inside\nan established organization\nsometimes are called “intrapreneurs”\nbecause of the special circumstances\nthat attend building a startup within a\nlarger company. As I have applied\nLean Startup ideas in an everwidening variety of companies and\nindustries, I have come to believe\nthat intrapreneurs have much more in\ncommon with the rest of the\ncommunity of entrepreneurs than\nmost people believe. Thus, when I\nuse the term entrepreneur, I am\nreferring to the whole startup\necosystem regardless of company\nsize, sector, or stage of development.\nThis book is for entrepreneurs of\nall stripes: from young visionaries\nwith little backing but great ideas to\nseasoned visionaries within larger\ncompanies such as Mark—and the\npeople who hold them accountable.\nIF I’M AN ENTREPRENEUR,\nWHAT’S A STARTUP?\nThe Lean Startup is a set of practices\nfor helping entrepreneurs increase\ntheir odds of building a successful\nstartup. To set the record straight, it’s\nimportant to define what a startup is:\nA startup is a human institution\ndesigned to create a new\nproduct or service under\nconditions of extreme\nuncertainty.\nI’ve come to realize that the most\nimportant part of this definition is\nwhat it omits. It says nothing about\nsize of the company, the industry, or\nthe sector of the economy. Anyone\nwho is creating a new product or\nbusiness under conditions of extreme\nuncertainty is an entrepreneur\nwhether he or she knows it or not\nand whether working in a\ngovernment agency, a venturebacked company, a nonprofit, or a\ndecidedly for-profit company with\nfinancial investors.\nLet’s take a look at each of the\npieces. The word institution connotes\nbureaucracy, process, even lethargy.\nHow can that be part of a startup?\nYet successful startups are full of\nactivities associated with building an\ninstitution: hiring creative\nemployees, coordinating their\nactivities, and creating a company\nculture that delivers results.\nWe often lose sight of the fact that\na startup is not just about a product, a\ntechnological breakthrough, or even\na brilliant idea. A startup is greater\nthan the sum of its parts; it is an\nacutely human enterprise.\nThe fact that a startup’s product or\nservice is a new innovation is also an\nessential part of the definition and a\ntricky part too. I prefer to use the\nbroadest definition of product, one\nthat encompasses any source of\nvalue for the people who become\ncustomers. Anything those\ncustomers experience from their\ninteraction with a company should\nbe considered part of that company’s\nproduct. This is true of a grocery\nstore, an e-commerce website, a\nconsulting service, and a nonprofit\nsocial service agency. In every case,\nthe organization is dedicated to\nuncovering a new source of value for\ncustomers and cares about the impact\nof its product on those customers.\nIt’s also important that the word\ninnovation be understood broadly.\nStartups use many kinds of\ninnovation: novel scientific\ndiscoveries, repurposing an existing\ntechnology for a new use, devising a\nnew business model that unlocks\nvalue that was hidden, or simply\nbringing a product or service to a\nnew location or a previously\nunderserved set of customers. In all\nthese cases, innovation is at the heart\nof the company’s success.\nThere is one more important part\nof this definition: the context in\nwhich the innovation happens. Most\nbusinesses—large and small alike—\nare excluded from this context.\nStartups are designed to confront\nsituations of extreme uncertainty. To\nopen up a new business that is an\nexact clone of an existing business\na l l the way down to the business\nmodel, pricing, target customer, and\nproduct may be an attractive\neconomic investment, but it is not a\nstartup because its success depends\nonly on execution—so much so that\nthis success can be modeled with\nhigh accuracy. (This is why so many\nsmall businesses can be financed\nwith simple bank loans; the level of\nrisk and uncertainty is understood\nwell enough that a loan officer can\nassess its prospects.)\nMost tools from general\nmanagement are not designed to\nflourish in the harsh soil of extreme\nuncertainty in which startups thrive.\nThe future is unpredictable,\ncustomers face a growing array of\nalternatives, and the pace of change\nis ever increasing. Yet most startups\n—in garages and enterprises alike—\nstill are managed by using standard\nforecasts, product milestones, and\ndetailed business plans.\nTHE SNAPTAX STORY\nIn 2009, a startup decided to try\nsomething really audacious. They\nwanted to liberate taxpayers from\nexpensive tax stores by automating\nthe process of collecting information\ntypically found on W-2 forms (the\nend-of-year statement that most\nemployees receive from their\nemployer that summarizes their\ntaxable wages for the year). The\nstartup quickly ran into difficulties.\nEven though many consumers had\naccess to a printer/scanner in their\nhome or office, few knew how to use\nthose devices. After numerous\nconversations with potential\ncustomers, the team lit upon the idea\nof having customers take\nphotographs of the forms directly\nfrom their cell phone. In the process\nof testing this concept, customers\nasked something unexpected: would\nit be possible to finish the whole tax\nreturn right on the phone itself?\nThat was not an easy task.\nTraditional tax preparation requires\nconsumers to wade through hundreds\nof questions, many forms, and a lot\nof paperwork. This startup tried\nsomething novel by deciding to ship\nan early version of its product that\ncould do much less than a complete\ntax package. The initial version\nworked only for consumers with a\nvery simple return to file, and it\nworked only in California.\nInstead of having consumers fill\nout a complex form, they allowed the\ncustomers to use the phone’s camera\nto take a picture of their W-2 forms.\nFrom that single picture, the\ncompany developed the technology\nto compile and file most of the 1040\nEZ tax return. Compared with the\ndrudgery of traditional tax filing, the\nnew product—called SnapTax—\nprovides a magical experience. From\nits modest beginning, SnapTax grew\ninto a significant startup success\nstory. Its nationwide launch in 2011\nshowed that customers loved it, to\nthe tune of more than 350,000\ndownloads in the first three weeks.\nThis is the kind of amazing\ninnovation you’d expect from a new\nstartup.\nHowever, the name of this\ncompany may surprise you. SnapTax\nwas developed by Intuit, America’s\nlargest producer of finance, tax, and\naccounting tools for individuals and\nsmall businesses. With more than\n7,700 employees and annual\nrevenues in the billions, Intuit is not\na typical startup.2\nThe team that built SnapTax\ndoesn’t look much like the\narchetypal image of entrepreneurs\neither. They don’t work in a garage\nor eat ramen noodles. Their company\ndoesn’t lack for resources. They are\npaid a full salary and benefits. They\ncome into a regular office every day.\nYet they are entrepreneurs.\nStories like this one are not nearly\nas common inside large corporations\nas they should be. After all, SnapTax\ncompetes directly with one of Intuit’s\nflagship products: the fully featured\nTurboTax desktop software. Usually,\ncompanies like Intuit fall into the\ntrap described in Clayton\nChristensten’s The Innovator’s\nDilemma: they are very good at\ncreating incremental improvements\nto existing products and serving\nexisting customers, which\nChristensen called sustaining\ninnovation, but struggle to create\nbreakthrough new products—\ndisruptive innovation—that can\ncreate new sustainable sources of\ngrowth.\nOne remarkable part of the\nSnapTax story is what the team\nleaders said when I asked them to\naccount for their unlikely success.\nDid they hire superstar entrepreneurs\nfrom outside the company? No, they\nassembled a team from within Intuit.\nDid they face constant meddling\nfrom senior management, which is\nthe bane of innovation teams in\nmany companies? No, their\nexecutive sponsors created an\n“island of freedom” where they\ncould experiment as necessary. Did\nthey have a huge team, a large\nbudget, and lots of marketing\ndollars? Nope, they started with a\nteam of five.\nWhat allowed the SnapTax team\nto innovate was not their genes,\ndestiny, or astrological signs but a\nprocess deliberately facilitated by\nIntuit’s senior management.\nInnovation is a bottoms-up,\ndecentralized, and unpredictable\nthing, but that doesn’t mean it cannot\nbe managed. It can, but to do so\nrequires a new management\ndiscipline, one that needs to be\nmastered not just by practicing\nentrepreneurs seeking to build the\nnext big thing but also by the people\nwho support them, nurture them, and\nhold them accountable. In other\nwords, cultivating entrepreneurship\nis the responsibility of senior\nmanagement. Today, a cutting-edge\ncompany such as Intuit can point to\nsuccess stories like SnapTax because\nit has recognized the need for a new\nmanagement paradigm. This is a\nrealization that was years in the\nmaking.3\nA SEVEN-THOUSAND-PERSON\nLEAN STARTUP\nIn 1983, Intuit’s founder, the\nlegendary entrepreneur Scott Cook,\nhad the radical notion (with\ncofounder Tom Proulx) that personal\naccounting should happen by\ncomputer. Their success was far\nfrom inevitable; they faced numerous\ncompetitors, an uncertain future, and\nan initially tiny market. A decade\nlater, the company went public and\nsubsequently fended off wellpublicized attacks from larger\nincumbents, including the software\nbehemoth Microsoft. Partly with the\nhelp of famed venture capitalist John\nDoerr, Intuit became a fully\ndiversified enterprise, a member of\nthe Fortune 1000 that now provides\ndozens of market-leading products\nacross its major divisions.\nThis is the kind of entrepreneurial\nsuccess we’re used to hearing about:\na ragtag team of underdogs who\neventually achieve fame, acclaim,\nand significant riches.\nFlash-forward to 2002. Cook was\nfrustrated. He had just tabulated ten\nyears of data on all of Intuit’s new\nproduct introductions and had\nconcluded that the company was\ngetting a measly return on its\nmassive investments. Simply put, too\nmany of its new products were\nfailing. By traditional standards,\nIntuit is an extremely well-managed\ncompany, but as Scott dug into the\nroot causes of those failures, he came\nto a difficult conclusion: the\nprevailing management paradigm he\nand his company had been practicing\nwas inadequate to the problem of\ncontinuous innovation in the modern\neconomy.\nBy fall 2009, Cook had been\nworking to change Intuit’s\nmanagement culture for several\nyears. He came across my early work\non the Lean Startup and asked me to\ngive a talk at Intuit. In Silicon Valley\nthis is not the kind of invitation you\nturn down. I admit I was curious. I\nwas still at the beginning of my Lean\nStartup journey and didn’t have\nmuch appreciation for the challenges\nfaced by a Fortune 1000 company\nlike his.\nMy conversations with Cook and\nIntuit chief executive officer (CEO)\nBrad Smith were my initiation into\nthe thinking of modern general\nmanagers, who struggle with\nentrepreneurship every bit as much\nas do venture capitalists and\nfounders in a garage. To combat\nthese challenges, Scott and Brad are\ngoing back to Intuit’s roots. They are\nworking to build entrepreneurship\nand risk taking into all their\ndivisions.\nFor example, consider one of\nIntuit’s flagship products. Because\nTurboTax does most of its sales\naround tax season in the United\nStates, it used to have an extremely\nconservative culture. Over the course\nof the year, the marketing and\nproduct teams would conceive one\nmajor initiative that would be rolled\nout just in time for tax season. Now\nthey test over five hundred different\nchanges in a two-and-a-half-month\ntax season. They’re running up to\nseventy different tests per week. The\nteam can make a change live on its\nwebsite on Thursday, run it over the\nweekend, read the results on\nMonday, and come to conclusions\nstarting Tuesday; then they rebuild\nnew tests on Thursday and launch\nthe next set on Thursday night.\nAs Scott put it, “Boy, the amount\nof learning they get is just immense\nnow. And what it does is develop\nentrepreneurs, because when you\nhave only one test, you don’t have\nentrepreneurs, you have politicians,\nbecause you have to sell. Out of a\nhundred good ideas, you’ve got to\nsell your idea. So you build up a\nsociety of politicians and\nsalespeople. When you have five\nhundred tests you’re running, then\neverybody’s ideas can run. And then\nyou create entrepreneurs who run\nand learn and can retest and relearn\nas opposed to a society of politicians.\nSo we’re trying to drive that\nthroughout our organization, using\nexamples which have nothing to do\nwith high tech, like the website\nexample. Every business today has a\nwebsite. You don’t have to be high\ntech to use fast-cycle testing.”\nThis kind of change is hard. After\nall, the company has a significant\nnumber of existing customers who\ncontinue to demand exceptional\nservice and investors who expect\nsteady, growing returns.\nScott says,\nIt goes against the grain of what\npeople have been taught in\nbusiness and what leaders have\nbeen taught. The problem isn’t\nwith the teams or the\nentrepreneurs. They love the\nchance to quickly get their baby\nout into the market. They love\nthe chance to have the customer\nvote instead of the suits voting.\nThe real issue is with the\nleaders and the middle\nmanagers. There are many\nbusiness leaders who have been\nsuccessful because of analysis.\nThey think they’re analysts, and\ntheir job is to do great planning\nand analyzing and have a plan.\nThe amount of time a company\ncan count on holding on to market\nleadership to exploit its earlier\ninnovations is shrinking, and this\ncreates an imperative for even the\nmost entrenched companies to invest\nin innovation. In fact, I believe a\ncompany’s only sustainable path to\nlong-term economic growth is to\nbuild an “innovation factory” that\nuses Lean Startup techniques to\ncreate disruptive innovations on a\ncontinuous basis. In other words,\nestablished companies need to figure\nout how to accomplish what Scott\nCook did in 1983, but on an\nindustrial scale and with an\nestablished cohort of managers\nsteeped in traditional management\nculture.\nEver the maverick, Cook asked me\nto put these ideas to the test, and so I\ngave a talk that was simulcast to all\nseven thousand–plus Intuit\nemployees during which I explained\nthe theory of the Lean Startup,\nrepeating my definition: an\norganization designed to create new\nproducts and services under\nconditions of extreme uncertainty.\nWhat happened next is etched in\nmy memory. CEO Brad Smith had\nbeen sitting next to me as I spoke.\nWhen I was done, he got up and said\nbefore all of Intuit’s employees,\n“Folks, listen up. You heard Eric’s\ndefinition of a startup. It has three\nparts, and we here at Intuit match all\nthree parts of that definition.”\nScott and Brad are leaders who\nrealize that something new is needed\nin management thinking. Intuit is\nproof that this kind of thinking can\nwork in established companies. Brad\nexplained to me how they hold\nthemselves accountable for their new\ninnovation efforts by measuring two\nthings: the number of customers\nusing products that didn’t exist three\nyears ago and the percentage of\nrevenue coming from offerings that\ndid not exist three years ago.\nUnder the old model, it took an\naverage of 5.5 years for a successful\nnew product to start generating $50\nmillion in revenue. Brad explained to\nme, “We’ve generated $50 million in\nofferings that did not exist twelve\nmonths ago in the last year. Now it’s\nnot one particular offering. It’s a\ncombination of a whole bunch of\ninnovation happening, but that’s the\nkind of stuff that’s creating some\nenergy for us, that we think we can\ntruly short-circuit the ramp by killing\nthings that don’t make sense fast and\ndoubling down on the ones that do.”\nFor a company as large as Intuit,\nthese are modest results and early\ndays. They have decades of legacy\nsystems and legacy thinking to\novercome. However, their leadership\nin adopting entrepreneurial\nmanagement is starting to pay off.\nLeadership requires creating\nconditions that enable employees to\ndo the kinds of experimentation that\nentrepreneurship requires. For\nexample, changes in TurboTax\nenabled the Intuit team to develop\nfive hundred experiments per tax\nseason. Before that, marketers with\ngreat ideas couldn’t have done those\ntests even if they’d wanted to,\nbecause they didn’t have a system in\nplace through which to change the\nwebsite rapidly. Intuit invested in\nsystems that increased the speed at\nwhich tests could be built, deployed,\nand analyzed.\nAs Cook says, “Developing these\nexperimentation systems is the\nresponsibility of senior management;\nthey have to be put in by the\nleadership. It’s moving leaders from\nplaying Caesar with their thumbs up\nand down on every idea to—instead\n—putting in the culture and the\nsystems so that teams can move and\ninnovate at the speed of the\nexperimentation system.”\n3\nLEARN\nAs an entrepreneur, nothing plagued\nme more than the question of\nwhether my company was making\nprogress toward creating a successful\nbusiness. As an engineer and later as\na manager, I was accustomed to\nmeasuring progress by making sure\nour work proceeded according to\nplan, was high quality, and cost\nabout what we had projected.\nAfter many years as an\nentrepreneur, I started to worry about\nmeasuring progress in this way.\nWhat if we found ourselves building\nsomething that nobody wanted? In\nthat case what did it matter if we did\nit on time and on budget? When I\nwent home at the end of a day’s\nwork, the only things I knew for sure\nwere that I had kept people busy and\nspent money that day. I hoped that\nmy team’s efforts took us closer to\nour goal. If we wound up taking a\nwrong turn, I’d have to take comfort\nin the fact that at least we’d learned\nsomething important.\nUnfortunately, “learning” is the\noldest excuse in the book for a\nfailure of execution. It’s what\nmanagers fall back on when they fail\nto achieve the results we promised.\nEntrepreneurs, under pressure to\nsucceed, are wildly creative when it\ncomes to demonstrating what we\nhave learned. We can all tell a good\nstory when our job, career, or\nreputation depends on it.\nHowever, learning is cold comfort\nto employees who are following an\nentrepreneur into the unknown. It is\ncold comfort to the investors who\nallocate precious money, time, and\nenergy to entrepreneurial teams. It is\ncold comfort to the organizations—\nlarge and small—that depend on\nentrepreneurial innovation to\nsurvive. You can’t take learning to\nthe bank; you can’t spend it or invest\nit. You cannot give it to customers\nand cannot return it to limited\npartners. Is it any wonder that\nlearning has a bad name in\nentrepreneurial and managerial\ncircles?\nYet if the fundamental goal of\nentrepreneurship is to engage in\norganization building under\nconditions of extreme uncertainty, its\nmost vital function is learning. We\nmust learn the truth about which\nelements of our strategy are working\nto realize our vision and which are\njust crazy. We must learn what\ncustomers really want, not what they\nsay they want or what we think they\nshould want. We must discover\nwhether we are on a path that will\nlead to growing a sustainable\nbusiness.\nIn the Lean Startup model, we are\nrehabilitating learning with a concept\nI call validated learning. Validated\nlearning is not after-the-fact\nrationalization or a good story\ndesigned to hide failure. It is a\nrigorous method for demonstrating\nprogress when one is embedded in\nthe soil of extreme uncertainty in\nwhich startups grow. Validated\nlearning is the process of\ndemonstrating empirically that a\nteam has discovered valuable truths\nabout a startup’s present and future\nbusiness prospects. It is more\nconcrete, more accurate, and faster\nthan market forecasting or classical\nbusiness planning. It is the principal\nantidote to the lethal problem of\nachieving failure: successfully\nexecuting a plan that leads nowhere.\nVALIDATED LEARNING AT\nIMVU\nLet me illustrate this with an\nexample from my career. Many\naudiences have heard me recount the\nstory of IMVU’s founding and the\nmany mistakes we made in\ndeveloping our first product. I’ll now\nelaborate on one of those mistakes to\nillustrate validated learning clearly.\nThose of us involved in the\nfounding of IMVU aspired to be\nserious strategic thinkers. Each of us\nhad participated in previous ventures\nthat had failed, and we were loath to\nrepeat that experience. Our main\nconcerns in the early days dealt with\nthe following questions: What should\nwe build and for whom? What\nmarket could we enter and\ndominate? How could we build\ndurable value that would not be\nsubject to erosion by competition?1\nBrilliant Strategy\nWe decided to enter the instant\nmessaging (IM) market. In 2004, that\nmarket had hundreds of millions of\nconsumers actively participating\nworldwide. However, the majority of\nthe customers who were using IM\nproducts were not paying for the\nprivilege. Instead, large media and\nportal companies such as AOL,\nMicrosoft, and Yahoo! operated their\nIM networks as a loss leader for\nother services while making modest\namounts of money through\nadvertising.\nIM is an example of a market that\ninvolves strong network effects. Like\nmost communication networks, IM is\nthought to follow Metcalfe’s law: the\nvalue of a network as a whole is\nproportional to the square of the\nnumber of participants. In other\nwords, the more people in the\nnetwork, the more valuable the\nnetwork. This makes intuitive sense:\nthe value to each participant is driven\nprimarily by how many other people\nhe or she can communicate with.\nImagine a world in which you own\nthe only telephone; it would have no\nvalue. Only when other people also\nhave a telephone does it become\nvaluable.\nIn 2004, the IM market was\nlocked up by a handful of\nincumbents. The top three networks\ncontrolled more than 80 percent of\nthe overall usage and were in the\nprocess of consolidating their gains\nin market share at the expense of a\nnumber of smaller players.2 The\ncommon wisdom was that it was\nmore or less impossible to bring a\nnew IM network to market without\nspending an extraordinary amount of\nmoney on marketing.\nThe reason for that wisdom is\nsimple. Because of the power of\nnetwork effects, IM products have\nhigh switching costs. To switch from\none network to another, customers\nwould have to convince their friends\nand colleagues to switch with them.\nThis extra work for customers\ncreates a barrier to entry in the IM\nmarket: with all consumers locked in\nto an incumbent’s product, there are\nno customers left with whom to\nestablish a beachhead.\nAt IMVU we settled on a strategy\nof building a product that would\ncombine the large mass appeal of\ntraditional IM with the high revenue\nper customer of three-dimensional\n(3D) video games and virtual worlds.\nBecause of the near impossibility of\nbringing a new IM network to\nmarket, we decided to build an IM\nadd-on product that would\ninteroperate with the existing\nnetworks. Thus, customers would be\nable to adopt the IMVU virtual\ngoods and avatar communication\ntechnology without having to switch\nIM providers, learn a new user\ninterface, and—most important—\nbring their friends with them.\nIn fact, we thought this last point\nwas essential. For the add-on product\nto be useful, customers would have\nto use it with their existing friends.\nEvery communication would come\nembedded with an invitation to join\nIMVU. Our product would be\ninherently viral, spreading\nthroughout the existing IM networks\nlike an epidemic. To achieve that\nviral growth, it was important that\nour add-on product support as many\nof the existing IM networks as\npossible and work on all kinds of\ncomputers.\nSix Months to Launch\nWith this strategy in place, my\ncofounders and I began a period of\nintense work. As the chief\ntechnology officer, it was my\nresponsibility, among other things, to\nwrite the software that would support\nIM interoperability across networks.\nMy cofounders and I worked for\nmonths, putting in crazy hours\nstruggling to get our first product\nreleased. We gave ourselves a hard\ndeadline of six months—180 days—\nto launch the product and attract our\nfirst paying customers. It was a\ngrueling schedule, but we were\ndetermined to launch on time.\nThe add-on product was so large\nand complex and had so many\nmoving parts that we had to cut a lot\nof corners to get it done on time. I\nwon’t mince words: the first version\nwas terrible. We spent endless hours\narguing about which bugs to fix and\nwhich we could live with, which\nfeatures to cut and which to try to\ncram in. It was a wonderful and\nterrifying time: we were full of hope\nabout the possibilities for success\nand full of fear about the\nconsequences of shipping a bad\nproduct.\nPersonally, I was worried that the\nlow quality of the product would\ntarnish my reputation as an engineer.\nPeople would think I didn’t know\nhow to build a quality product. All of\nus feared tarnishing the IMVU\nbrand; after all, we were charging\npeople money for a product that\ndidn’t work very well. We all\nenvisioned the damning newspaper\nheadlines: “Inept Entrepreneurs\nBuild Dreadful Product.”\nAs launch day approached, our\nfears escalated. In our situation,\nmany entrepreneurial teams give in\nto fear and postpone the launch date.\nAlthough I understand this impulse, I\nam glad we persevered, since delay\nprevents many startups from getting\nthe feedback they need. Our previous\nfailures made us more afraid of\nanother, even worse, outcome than\nshipping a bad product: building\nsomething that nobody wants. And\nso, teeth clenched and apologies at\nthe ready, we released our product to\nthe public.\nLaunch\nAnd then—nothing happened! It\nturned out that our fears were\nunfounded, because nobody even\ntried our product. At first I was\nrelieved because at least nobody was\nfinding out how bad the product was,\nbut soon that gave way to serious\nfrustration. After all the hours we\nhad spent arguing about which\nfeatures to include and which bugs to\nfix, our value proposition was so far\noff that customers weren’t getting far\nenough into the experience to find\nout how bad our design choices\nwere. Customers wouldn’t even\ndownload our product.\nOver the ensuing weeks and\nmonths, we labored to make the\nproduct better. We brought in a\nsteady flow of customers through our\nonline registration and download\nprocess. We treated each day’s\ncustomers as a brand-new report card\nto let us know how we were doing.\nWe eventually learned how to\nchange the product’s positioning so\nthat customers at least would\ndownload it. We were making\nimprovements to the underlying\nproduct continuously, shipping bug\nfixes and new changes daily.\nHowever, despite our best efforts, we\nwere able to persuade only a\npathetically small number of people\nto buy the product.\nIn retrospect, one good decision\nwe made was to set clear revenue\ntargets for those early days. In the\nfirst month we intended to make\n$300 in total revenue, and we did—\nbarely. Many friends and family\nmembers were asked (okay, begged).\nEach month our small revenue\ntargets increased, first to $350 and\nthen to $400. As they rose, our\nstruggles increased. We soon ran out\nof friends and family; our frustration\nescalated. We were making the\nproduct better every day, yet our\ncustomers’ behavior remained\nunchanged: they still wouldn’t use it.\nOur failure to move the numbers\nprodded us to accelerate our efforts\nto bring customers into our office for\nin-person interviews and usability\ntests. The quantitative targets created\nthe motivation to engage in\nqualitative inquiry and guided us in\nthe questions we asked; this is a\npattern we’ll see throughout this\nbook.\nI wish I could say that I was the\none to realize our mistake and\nsuggest the solution, but in truth, I\nwas the last to admit the problem. In\nshort, our entire strategic analysis of\nthe market was utterly wrong. We\nfigured this out empirically, through\nexperimentation, rather than through\nfocus groups or market research.\nCustomers could not tell us what\nthey wanted; most, after all, had\nnever heard of 3D avatars. Instead,\nthey revealed the truth through their\naction or inaction as we struggled to\nmake the product better.\nTalking to Customers\nOut of desperation, we decided to\ntalk to some potential customers. We\nbrought them into our office, and\nsaid, “Try this new product; it’s\nIMVU.” If the person was a\nteenager, a heavy user of IM, or a\ntech early adopter, he or she would\nengage with us. In constrast, if it was\na mainstream person, the response\nwas, “Right. So exactly what would\nyou like me to do?” We’d get\nnowhere with the mainstream group;\nthey thought IMVU was too weird.\nImagine a seventeen-year-old girl\nsitting down with us to look at this\nproduct. She chooses her avatar and\nsays, “Oh, this is really fun.” She’s\ncustomizing the avatar, deciding how\nshe’s going to look. Then we say,\n“All right, it’s time to download the\ninstant messaging add-on,” and she\nresponds, “What’s that?”\n“Well, it’s this thing that\ninteroperates with the instant\nmessaging client.” She’s looking at\nus and thinking, “I’ve never heard of\nthat, my friends have never heard of\nthat, why do you want me to do\nthat?” It required a lot of\nexplanation; an instant messaging\nadd-on was not a product category\nthat existed in her mind.\nBut since she was in the room\nwith us, we were able to talk her into\ndoing it. She downloads the product,\nand then we say, “Okay, invite one\nof your friends to chat.” And she\nsays, “No way!” We say, “Why\nnot?” And she says, “Well, I don’t\nknow if this thing is cool yet. You\nwant me to risk inviting one of my\nfriends? What are they going to think\nof me? If it sucks, they’re going to\nthink I suck, right?” And we say,\n“No, no, it’s going to be so much fun\nonce you get the person in there; it’s\na social product.” She looks at us,\nher face filled with doubt; you can\nsee that this is a deal breaker. Of\ncourse, the first time I had that\nexperience, I said, “It’s all right, it’s\njust this one person, send her away\nand get me a new one.” Then the\nsecond customer comes in and says\nthe same thing. Then the third\ncustomer comes in, and it’s the same\nthing. You start to see patterns, and\nno matter how stubborn you are,\nthere’s obviously something wrong.\nCustomers kept saying, “I want to\nuse it by myself. I want to try it out\nfirst to see if it’s really cool before I\ninvite a friend.” Our team was from\nthe video game industry, so we\nunderstood what that meant: singleplayer mode. So we built a singleplayer version. We’d bring new\ncustomers into our office. They’d\ncustomize the avatar and download\nthe product like before. Then they\nwould go into single-player mode,\nand we’d say, “Play with your avatar\nand dress it up; check out the cool\nmoves it can make.” Followed by,\n“Okay, you did that by yourself; now\nit’s time to invite one of your\nfriends.” You can see what’s\ncoming. They’d say, “No way! This\nisn’t cool.” And we’d say, “Well, we\ntold you it wasn’t going to be cool!\nWhat is the point of a single-player\nexperience for a social product?”\nSee, we thought we should get a gold\nstar just for listening to our\ncustomers. Except our customers still\ndidn’t like the product. They would\nlook at us and say, “Listen, old man,\nyou don’t understand. What is the\ndeal with this crazy business of\ninviting friends before I know if it’s\ncool?” It was a total deal breaker.\nOut of further desperation, we\nintroduced a feature called ChatNow\nthat allows you to push a button and\nbe randomly matched with\nsomebody else anywhere in the\nworld. The only thing you have in\ncommon is that you both pushed the\nbutton at the same time. All of a\nsudden, in our customer service tests,\npeople were saying, “Oh, this is\nfun!”\nSo we’d bring them in, they’d use\nChatNow, and maybe they would\nmeet somebody they thought was\ncool. They’d say, “Hey, that guy was\nneat; I want to add him to my buddy\nlist. Where’s my buddy list?” And\nwe’d say, “Oh, no, you don’t want a\nnew buddy list; you want to use your\nregular AOL buddy list.” Remember,\nthis was how we planned to harness\nthe interoperability that would lead\nto network effects and viral growth.\nPicture the customer looking at us,\nasking, “What do you want me to do\nexactly?” And we’d say, “Well, just\ngive the stranger your AIM screen\nname so you can put him on your\nbuddy list.” You could see their eyes\ngo wide, and they’d say, “Are you\nkidding me? A stranger on my AIM\nbuddy list?” To which we’d respond,\n“Yes; otherwise you’d have to\ndownload a whole new IM client\nwith a new buddy list.” And they’d\nsay, “Do you have any idea how\nmany IM clients I already run?”\n“No. One or two, maybe?” That’s\nhow many clients each of us in the\noffice used. To which the teenager\nwould say, “Duh! I run eight.” We\nhad no idea how many instant\nmessaging clients there were in the\nworld.\nWe had the incorrect\npreconception that it’s a challenge to\nlearn new software and it’s tricky to\nmove your friends over to a new\nbuddy list. Our customers revealed\nthat this was nonsense. We wanted\nto draw diagrams on the whiteboard\nthat showed why our strategy was\nbrilliant, but our customers didn’t\nunderstand concepts like network\neffects and switching costs. If we\ntried to explain why they should\nbehave the way we predicted, they’d\njust shake their heads at us,\nbewildered.\nWe had a mental model for how\npeople used software that was years\nout of date, and so eventually,\npainfully, after dozens of meetings\nlike that, it started to dawn on us that\nthe IM add-on concept was\nfundamentally flawed.3\nOur customers did not want an IM\nadd-on; they wanted a stand-alone\nIM network. They did not consider\nhaving to learn how to use a new IM\nprogram a barrier; on the contrary,\nour early adopters used many\ndifferent IM programs\nsimultaneously. Our customers were\nnot intimidated by the idea of having\nto take their friends with them to a\nnew IM network; it turned out that\nthey enjoyed that challenge. Even\nmore surprising, our assumption that\ncustomers would want to use avatarbased IM primarily with their\nexisting friends was also wrong.\nThey wanted to make new friends,\nan activity that 3D avatars are\nparticularly well suited to\nfacilitating. Bit by bit, customers tore\napart our seemingly brilliant initial\nstrategy.\nThrowing My Work Away\nPerhaps you can sympathize with our\nsituation and forgive my obstinacy.\nAfter all, it was my work over the\nprior months that needed to be\nthrown away. I had slaved over the\nsoftware that was required to make\nour IM program interoperate with\nother networks, which was at the\nheart of our original strategy. When\nit came time to pivot and abandon\nthat original strategy, almost all of\nmy work—thousands of lines of\ncode—was thrown out. I felt\nbetrayed. I was a devotee of the\nlatest in software development\nmethods (known collectively as agile\ndevelopment), which promised to\nhelp drive waste out of product\ndevelopment. However, despite that,\nI had committed the biggest waste of\nall: building a product that our\ncustomers refused to use. That was\nreally depressing.\nI wondered: in light of the fact that\nmy work turned out to be a waste of\ntime and energy, would the company\nhave been just as well off if I had\nspent the last six months on a beach\nsipping umbrella drinks? Had I really\nbeen needed? Would it have been\nbetter if I had not done any work at\nall?\nThere is, as I mentioned at the\nbeginning of this chapter, always one\nlast refuge for people aching to\njustify their own failure. I consoled\nmyself that if we hadn’t built this\nfirst product—mistakes and all—we\nnever would have learned these\nimportant insights about customers.\nWe never would have learned that\nour strategy was flawed. There is\ntruth in this excuse: what we learned\nduring those critical early months set\nIMVU on a path that would lead to\nour eventual breakout success.\nFor a time, this “learning”\nconsolation made me feel better, but\nmy relief was short-lived. Here’s the\nquestion that bothered me most of\nall: if the goal of those months was\nto learn these important insights\nabout customers, why did it take so\nlong? How much of our effort\ncontributed to the essential lessons\nwe needed to learn? Could we have\nlearned those lessons earlier if I\nhadn’t been so focused on making\nthe product “better” by adding\nfeatures and fixing bugs?\nVALUE VS. WASTE\nIn other words, which of our efforts\nare value-creating and which are\nwasteful? This question is at the\nheart of the lean manufacturing\nrevolution; it is the first question any\nlean manufacturing adherent is\ntrained to ask. Learning to see waste\nand then systematically eliminate it\nhas allowed lean companies such as\nToyota to dominate entire industries.\nIn the world of software, the agile\ndevelopment methodologies I had\npracticed until that time had their\norigins in lean thinking. They were\ndesigned to eliminate waste too.\nYet those methods had led me\ndown a road in which the majority of\nmy team’s efforts were wasted.\nWhy?\nThe answer came to me slowly\nover the subsequent years. Lean\nthinking defines value as providing\nbenefit to the customer; anything\nelse is waste. In a manufacturing\nbusiness, customers don’t care how\nthe product is assembled, only that it\nworks correctly. But in a startup,\nwho the customer is and what the\ncustomer might find valuable are\nunknown, part of the very\nuncertainty that is an essential part of\nthe definition of a startup. I realized\nthat as a startup, we needed a new\ndefinition of value. The real progress\nwe had made at IMVU was what we\nhad learned over those first months\nabout what creates value for\ncustomers.\nAnything we had done during\nthose months that did not contribute\nto our learning was a form of waste.\nWould it have been possible to learn\nthe same things with less effort?\nClearly, the answer is yes.\nFor one thing, think of all the\ndebate and prioritization of effort\nthat went into features that customers\nwould never discover. If we had\nshipped sooner, we could have\navoided that waste. Also consider all\nthe waste caused by our incorrect\nstrategic assumptions. I had built\ninteroperability for more than a\ndozen different IM clients and\nnetworks. Was this really necessary\nto test our assumptions? Could we\nhave gotten the same feedback from\nour customers with half as many\nnetworks? With only three? With\nonly one? Since the customers of all\nIM networks found our product\nequally unattractive, the level of\nlearning would have been the same,\nbut our effort would have been\ndramatically less.\nHere’s the thought that kept me up\nnights: did we have to support any\nnetworks at all? Is it possible that we\ncould have discovered how flawed\nour assumptions were without\nbuilding anything? For example,\nwhat if we simply had offered\ncustomers the opportunity to\ndownload the product from us solely\non the basis of its proposed features\nbefore building anything?\nRemember, almost no customers\nwere willing to use our original\nproduct, so we wouldn’t have had to\ndo much apologizing when we failed\nto deliver. (Note that this is different\nfrom asking customers what they\nwant. Most of the time customers\ndon’t know what they want in\nadvance.) We could have conducted\nan experiment, offering customers\nthe chance to try something and then\nmeasuring their behavior.\nSuch thought experiments were\nextremely disturbing to me because\nthey undermined my job description.\nAs the head of product development,\nI thought my job was to ensure the\ntimely delivery of high-quality\nproducts and features. But if many of\nthose features were a waste of time,\nwhat should I be doing instead? How\ncould we avoid this waste?\nI’ve come to believe that learning\nis the essential unit of progress for\nstartups. The effort that is not\nabsolutely necessary for learning\nwhat customers want can be\neliminated. I call this validated\nlearning because it is always\ndemonstrated by positive\nimprovements in the startup’s core\nmetrics. As we’ve seen, it’s easy to\nkid yourself about what you think\ncustomers want. It’s also easy to\nlearn things that are completely\nirrelevant. Thus, validated learning is\nbacked up by empirical data\ncollected from real customers.\nWHERE DO YOU FIND\nVALIDATION?\nAs I can attest, anybody who fails in\na startup can claim that he or she has\nlearned a lot from the experience.\nThey can tell a compelling story. In\nfact, in the story of IMVU so far, you\nmight have noticed something\nmissing. Despite my claims that we\nlearned a lot in those early months,\nlessons that led to our eventual\nsuccess, I haven’t offered any\nevidence to back that up. In\nhindsight, it’s easy to make such\nclaims and sound credible (and\nyou’ll see some evidence later in the\nbook), but imagine us in IMVU’s\nearly months trying to convince\ninvestors, employees, family\nmembers, and most of all ourselves\nthat we had not squandered our time\nand resources. What evidence did we\nhave?\nCertainly our stories of failure\nwere entertaining, and we had\nfascinating theories about what we\nhad done wrong and what we needed\nto do to create a more successful\nproduct. However, the proof did not\ncome until we put those theories into\npractice and built subsequent\nversions of the product that showed\nsuperior results with actual\ncustomers.\nThe next few months are where\nthe true story of IMVU begins, not\nwith our brilliant assumptions and\nstrategies and whiteboard\ngamesmanship but with the hard\nwork of discovering what customers\nreally wanted and adjusting our\nproduct and strategy to meet those\ndesires. We adopted the view that\nour job was to find a synthesis\nbetween our vision and what\ncustomers would accept; it wasn’t to\ncapitulate to what customers thought\nthey wanted or to tell customers what\nthey ought to want.\nAs we came to understand our\ncustomers better, we were able to\nimprove our products. As we did\nthat, the fundamental metrics of our\nbusiness changed. In the early days,\ndespite our efforts to improve the\nproduct, our metrics were stubbornly\nflat. We treated each day’s\ncustomers as a new report card.\nWe’d pay attention to the percentage\nof new customers who exhibited\nproduct behaviors such as\ndownloading and buying our\nproduct. Each day, roughly the same\nnumber of customers would buy the\nproduct, and that number was pretty\nclose to zero despite the many\nimprovements.\nHowever, once we pivoted away\nfrom the original strategy, things\nstarted to change. Aligned with a\nsuperior strategy, our product\ndevelopment efforts became\nmagically more productive—not\nbecause we were working harder but\nbecause we were working smarter,\naligned with our customers’ real\nneeds. Positive changes in metrics\nbecame the quantitative validation\nthat our learning was real. This was\ncritically important because we could\nshow our stakeholders—employees,\ninvestors, and ourselves—that we\nwere making genuine progress, not\ndeluding ourselves. It is also the\nright way to think about productivity\nin a startup: not in terms of how\nmuch stuff we are building but in\nterms of how much validated\nlearning we’re getting for our\nefforts.4\nFor example, in one early\nexperiment, we changed our entire\nwebsite, home page, and product\nregistration flow to replace “avatar\nchat” with “3D instant messaging.”\nNew customers were split\nautomatically between these two\nversions of the site; half saw one,\nand half saw the other. We were able\nto measure the difference in behavior\nbetween the two groups. Not only\nwere the people in the experimental\ngroup more likely to sign up for the\nproduct, they were more likely to\nbecome long-term paying customers.\nWe had plenty of failed\nexperiments too. During one period\nin which we believed that customers\nweren’t using the product because\nthey didn’t understand its many\nbenefits, we went so far as to pay\ncustomer service agents to act as\nvirtual tour guides for new\ncustomers. Unfortunately, customers\nwho got that VIP treatment were no\nmore likely to become active or\npaying customers.\nEven after ditching the IM add-on\nstrategy, it still took months to\nunderstand why it hadn’t worked.\nAfter our pivot and many failed\nexperiments, we finally figured out\nthis insight: customers wanted to use\nIMVU to make new friends online.\nO u r customers intuitively grasped\nsomething that we were slow to\nrealize. All the existing social\nproducts online were centered on\ncustomers’ real-life identity. IMVU’s\navatar technology, however, was\nuniquely well suited to help people\nget to know each other online\nwithout compromising safety or\nopening themselves up to identity\ntheft. Once we formed this\nhypothesis, our experiments became\nmuch more likely to produce positive\nresults. Whenever we would change\nthe product to make it easier for\npeople to find and keep new friends,\nwe discovered that customers were\nmore likely to engage. This is true\nstartup productivity: systematically\nfiguring out the right things to build.\nThese were just a few experiments\namong hundreds that we ran week in\nand week out as we started to learn\nwhich customers would use the\nproduct and why. Each bit of\nknowledge we gathered suggested\nnew experiments to run, which\nmoved our metrics closer and closer\nto our goal.\nTHE AUDACITY OF ZERO\nDespite IMVU’s early success, our\ngross numbers were still pretty small.\nUnfortunately, because of the\ntraditional way businesses are\nevaluated, this is a dangerous\nsituation. The irony is that it is often\neasier to raise money or acquire\nother resources when you have zero\nrevenue, zero customers, and zero\ntraction than when you have a small\namount. Zero invites imagination,\nbut small numbers invite questions\nabout whether large numbers will\never materialize. Everyone knows (or\nthinks he or she knows) stories of\nproducts that achieved breakthrough\nsuccess overnight. As long as\nnothing has been released and no\ndata have been collected, it is still\npossible to imagine overnight\nsuccess in the future. Small numbers\npour cold water on that hope.\nThis phenomenon creates a brutal\nincentive: postpone getting any data\nuntil you are certain of success. Of\ncourse, as we’ll see, such delays\nhave the unfortunate effect of\nincreasing the amount of wasted\nwork, decreasing essential feedback,\nand dramatically increasing the risk\nthat a startup will build something\nnobody wants.\nHowever, releasing a product and\nhoping for the best is not a good plan\neither, because this incentive is real.\nWhen we launched IMVU, we were\nignorant of this problem. Our earliest\ninvestors and advisers thought it was\nquaint that we had a $300-per-month\nrevenue plan at first. But after\nseveral months with our revenue\nhovering around $500 per month,\nsome began to lose faith, as did some\nof our advisers, employees, and even\nspouses. In fact, at one point, some\ninvestors were seriously\nrecommending that we pull the\nproduct out of the market and return\nto stealth mode. Fortunately, as we\npivoted and experimented,\nincorporating what we learned into\nour product development and\nmarketing efforts, our numbers\nstarted to improve.\nBut not by much! On the one\nhand, we were lucky to see a growth\npattern that started to look like the\nfamous hockey stick graph. On the\nother hand, the graph went up only to\na few thousand dollars per month.\nThese early graphs, although\npromising, were not by themselves\nsufficient to combat the loss of faith\ncaused by our early failure, and we\nlacked the language of validated\nlearning to provide an alternative\nconcept to rally around. We were\nquite fortunate that some of our early\ninvestors understood its importance\nand were willing to look beyond our\nsmall gross numbers to see the real\nprogress we were making. (You’ll\nsee the exact same graphs they did in\nChapter 7.)\nThus, we can mitigate the waste\nthat happens because of the audacity\nof zero with validated learning. What\nwe needed to demonstrate was that\nour product development efforts\nwere leading us toward massive\nsuccess without giving in to the\ntemptation to fall back on vanity\nmetrics and “success theater”—the\nwork we do to make ourselves look\nsuccessful. We could have tried\nmarketing gimmicks, bought a Super\nBowl ad, or tried flamboyant public\nrelations (PR) as a way of juicing our\ngross numbers. That would have\ngiven investors the illusion of\ntraction, but only for a short time.\nEventually, the fundamentals of the\nbusiness would win out and the PR\nbump would pass. Because we\nwould have squandered precious\nresources on theatrics instead of\nprogress, we would have been in real\ntrouble.\nSixty million avatars later, IMVU\nis still going strong. Its legacy is not\njust a great product, an amazing\nteam, and promising financial results\nbut a whole new way of measuring\nthe progress of startups.\nLESSONS BEYOND IMVU\nI have had many opportunities to\nteach the IMVU story as a business\ncase ever since Stanford’s Graduate\nSchool of Business wrote an official\nstudy about IMVU’s early years.5\nThe case is now part of the\nentrepreneurship curriculum at\nseveral business schools, including\nHarvard Business School, where I\nserve as an entrepreneur in\nresidence. I’ve also told these stories\nat countless workshops, lectures, and\nconferences.\nEvery time I teach the IMVU\nstory, students have an\noverwhelming temptation to focus on\nthe tactics it illustrates: launching a\nlow-quality early prototype, charging\ncustomers from day one, and using\nlow-volume revenue targets as a way\nto drive accountability. These are\nuseful techniques, but they are not\nthe moral of the story. There are too\nmany exceptions. Not every kind of\ncustomer will accept a low-quality\nprototype, for example. If the\nstudents are more skeptical, they\nmay argue that the techniques do not\napply to their industry or situation,\nbut work only because IMVU is a\nsoftware company, a consumer\nInternet business, or a non-missioncritical application.\nNone of these takeaways is\nespecially useful. The Lean Startup\nis not a collection of individual\ntactics. It is a principled approach to\nnew product development. The only\nway to make sense of its\nrecommendations is to understand\nthe underlying principles that make\nthem work. As we’ll see in later\nchapters, the Lean Startup model has\nbeen applied to a wide variety of\nbusinesses and industries:\nmanufacturing, clean tech,\nrestaurants, and even laundry. The\ntactics from the IMVU story may or\nmay not make sense in your\nparticular business.\nInstead, the way forward is to\nlearn to see every startup in any\nindustry as a grand experiment. The\nquestion is not “Can this product be\nbuilt?” In the modern economy,\nalmost any product that can be\nimagined can be built. The more\npertinent questions are “Should this\nproduct be built?” and “Can we build\na sustainable business around this set\nof products and services?” To\nanswer those questions, we need a\nmethod for systematically breaking\ndown a business plan into its\ncomponent parts and testing each\npart empirically.\nIn other words, we need the\nscientific method. In the Lean\nStartup model, every product, every\nfeature, every marketing campaign—\neverything a startup does—is\nunderstood to be an experiment\ndesigned to achieve validated\nlearning. This experimental approach\nworks across industries and sectors,\nas we’ll see in Chapter 4.\n4\nEXPERIMENT\nI come across many startups that are\nstruggling to answer the following\nquestions: Which customer opinions\nshould we listen to, if any? How\nshould we prioritize across the many\nfeatures we could build? Which\nfeatures are essential to the product’s\nsuccess and which are ancillary?\nWhat can be changed safely, and\nwhat might anger customers? What\nmight please today’s customers at\nthe expense of tomorrow’s? What\nshould we work on next?\nThese are some of the questions\nteams struggle to answer if they have\nfollowed the “let’s just ship a\nproduct and see what happens” plan.\nI call this the “just do it” school of\nentrepreneurship after Nike’s famous\nslogan.1 Unfortunately, if the plan is\nto see what happens, a team is\nguaranteed to succeed—at seeing\nwhat happens—but won’t\nnecessarily gain validated learning.\nThis is one of the most important\nlessons of the scientific method: if\nyou cannot fail, you cannot learn.\nFROM ALCHEMY TO SCIENCE\nThe Lean Startup methodology\nreconceives a startup’s efforts as\nexperiments that test its strategy to\nsee which parts are brilliant and\nwhich are crazy. A true experiment\nfollows the scientific method. It\nbegins with a clear hypothesis that\nmakes predictions about what is\nsupposed to happen. It then tests\nthose predictions empirically. Just as\nscientific experimentation is\ninformed by theory, startup\nexperimentation is guided by the\nstartup’s vision. The goal of every\nstartup experiment is to discover\nhow to build a sustainable business\naround that vision.\nThink Big, Start Small\nZappos is the world’s largest online\nshoe store, with annual gross sales in\nexcess of $1 billion. It is known as\none of the most successful,\ncustomer-friendly e-commerce\nbusinesses in the world, but it did not\nstart that way.\nFounder Nick Swinmurn was\nfrustrated because there was no\ncentral online site with a great\nselection of shoes. He envisioned a\nnew and superior retail experience.\nSwinmurn could have waited a long\ntime, insisting on testing his\ncomplete vision complete with\nwarehouses, distribution partners,\nand the promise of significant sales.\nMany early e-commerce pioneers did\njust that, including infamous dot-com\nfailures such as Webvan and\nPets.com.\nInstead, he started by running an\nexperiment. His hypothesis was that\ncustomers were ready and willing to\nbuy shoes online. To test it, he began\nby asking local shoe stores if he\ncould take pictures of their\ninventory. In exchange for\npermission to take the pictures, he\nwould post the pictures online and\ncome back to buy the shoes at full\nprice if a customer bought them\nonline.\nZappos began with a tiny, simple\nproduct. It was designed to answer\none question above all: is there\nalready sufficient demand for a\nsuperior online shopping experience\nfor shoes? However, a well-designed\nstartup experiment like the one\nZappos began with does more than\ntest a single aspect of a business\nplan. In the course of testing this first\nassumption, many other assumptions\nwere tested as well. To sell the\nshoes, Zappos had to interact with\ncustomers: taking payment, handling\nreturns, and dealing with customer\nsupport. This is decidedly different\nfrom market research. If Zappos had\nrelied on existing market research or\nconducted a survey, it could have\nasked what customers thought they\nwanted. By building a product\ninstead, albeit a simple one, the\ncompany learned much more:\n1. It had more accurate data\nabout customer demand\nbecause it was observing real\ncustomer behavior, not\nasking hypothetical\nquestions.\n2. It put itself in a position to\ninteract with real customers\nand learn about their needs.\nFor example, the business\nplan might call for discounted\npricing, but how are customer\nperceptions of the product\naffected by the discounting\nstrategy?\n3. It allowed itself to be\nsurprised when customers\nbehaved in unexpected ways,\nrevealing information Zappos\nmight not have known to ask\nabout. For example, what if\ncustomers returned the\nshoes?\nZappos’ initial experiment\nprovided a clear, quantifiable\noutcome: either a sufficient number\nof customers would buy the shoes or\nthey would not. It also put the\ncompany in a position to observe,\ninteract with, and learn from real\ncustomers and partners. This\nqualitative learning is a necessary\ncompanion to quantitative testing.\nAlthough the early efforts were\ndecidedly small-scale, that did not\nprevent the huge Zappos vision from\nbeing realized. In fact, in 2009\nZappos was acquired by the ecommerce giant Amazon.com for a\nreported $1.2 billion.2\nFor Long-Term Change,\nExperiment Immediately\nCaroline Barlerin is a director in the\nglobal social innovation division at\nHewlett-Packard (HP), a\nmultinational company with more\nthan three hundred thousand\nemployees and more than $100\nbillion in annual sales. Caroline, who\nleads global community\ninvolvement, is a social entrepreneur\nworking to get more of HP’s\nemployees to take advantage of the\ncompany’s policy on volunteering.\nCorporate guidelines encourage\nevery employee to spend up to four\nhours a month of company time\nvolunteering in his or her\ncommunity; that volunteer work\ncould take the form of any\nphilanthropic effort: painting fences,\nbuilding houses, or even using pro\nbono or work-based skills outside the\ncompany. Encouraging the latter type\nof volunteering was Caroline’s\npriority. Because of its talent and\nvalues, HP’s combined workforce\nhas the potential to have a\nmonumental positive impact. A\ndesigner could help a nonprofit with\na new website design. A team of\nengineers could wire a school for\nInternet access.\nCaroline’s project is just\nbeginning, and most employees do\nnot know that this volunteering\npolicy exists, and only a tiny fraction\ntake advantage of it. Most of the\nvolunteering has been of the lowimpact variety, involving manual\nlabor, even when the volunteers were\nhighly trained experts. Barlerin’s\nvision is to take the hundreds of\nthousands of employees in the\ncompany and transform them into a\nforce for social good.\nThis is the kind of corporate\ninitiative undertaken every day at\ncompanies around the world. It\ndoesn’t look like a startup by the\nconventional definition or what we\nsee in the movies. On the surface it\nseems to be suited to traditional\nmanagement and planning. However,\nI hope the discussion in Chapter 2\nhas prompted you to be a little\nsuspicious. Here’s how we might\nanalyze this project using the Lean\nStartup framework.\nCaroline’s project faces extreme\nuncertainty: there had never been a\nvolunteer campaign of this\nmagnitude at HP before. How\nconfident should she be that she\nknows the real reasons people aren’t\nvolunteering? Most important, how\nmuch does she really know about\nhow to change the behavior of\nhundreds of thousand people in more\nthan 170 countries? Barlerin’s goal is\nto inspire her colleagues to make the\nworld a better place. Looked at that\nway, her plan seems full of untested\nassumptions—and a lot of vision.\nIn accordance with traditional\nmanagement practices, Barlerin is\nspending time planning, getting buyin from various departments and\nother managers, and preparing a road\nmap of initiatives for the first\neighteen months of her project. She\nalso has a strong accountability\nframework with metrics for the\nimpact her project should have on\nthe company over the next four\nyears. Like many entrepreneurs, she\nhas a business plan that lays out her\nintentions nicely. Yet despite all that\nwork, she is—so far—creating oneoff wins and no closer to knowing if\nher vision will be able to scale.\nOne assumption, for example,\nmight be that the company’s longstanding values included a\ncommitment to improving the\ncommunity but that recent economic\ntrouble had resulted in an increased\ncompanywide strategic focus on\nshort-term profitability. Perhaps\nlongtime employees would feel a\ndesire to reaffirm their values of\ngiving back to the community by\nvolunteering. A second assumption\ncould be that they would find it more\nsatisfying and therefore more\nsustainable to use their actual\nworkplace skills in a volunteer\ncapacity, which would have a greater\nimpact on behalf of the organizations\nto which they donated their time.\nAlso lurking within Caroline’s plans\nare many practical assumptions\nabout employees’ willingness to take\nthe time to volunteer, their level of\ncommitment and desire, and the way\nto best reach them with her message.\nThe Lean Startup model offers a\nway to test these hypotheses\nrigorously, immediately, and\nthoroughly. Strategic planning takes\nmonths to complete; these\nexperiments could begin\nimmediately. By starting small,\nCaroline could prevent a tremendous\namount of waste down the road\nwithout compromising her overall\nvision. Here’s what it might look like\nif Caroline were to treat her project\nas an experiment.\nBreak It Down\nThe first step would be to break\ndown the grand vision into its\ncomponent parts. The two most\nimportant assumptions entrepreneurs\nmake are what I call the value\nhypothesis and the growth\nhypothesis.\nThe value hypothesis tests whether\na product or service really delivers\nvalue to customers once they are\nusing it. What’s a good indicator that\nemployees find donating their time\nvaluable? We could survey them to\nget their opinion, but that would not\nbe very accurate because most\npeople have a hard time assessing\ntheir feelings objectively.\nExperiments provide a more\naccurate gauge. What could we see\nin real time that would serve as a\nproxy for the value participants were\ngaining from volunteering? We\ncould find opportunities for a small\nnumber of employees to volunteer\nand then look at the retention rate of\nthose employees. How many of them\nsign up to volunteer again? When an\nemployee voluntarily invests their\ntime and attention in this program,\nthat is a strong indicator that they\nfind it valuable.\nFor the growth hypothesis, which\ntests how new customers will\ndiscover a product or service, we can\ndo a similar analysis. Once the\nprogram is up and running, how will\nit spread among the employees, from\ninitial early adopters to mass\nadoption throughout the company? A\nlikely way this program could\nexpand is through viral growth. If\nthat is true, the most important thing\nto measure is behavior: would the\nearly participants actively spread the\nword to other employees?\nIn this case, a simple experiment\nwould involve taking a very small\nnumber—a dozen, perhaps—of\nexisting long-term employees and\nproviding an exceptional volunteer\nopportunity for them. Because\nCaroline’s hypothesis was that\nemployees would be motivated by\ntheir desire to live up to HP’s\nhistorical commitment to community\nservice, the experiment would target\nemployees who felt the greatest\nsense of disconnect between their\ndaily routine and the company’s\nexpressed values. The point is not to\nfind the average customer but to find\nearly adopters: the customers who\nfeel the need for the product most\nacutely. Those customers tend to be\nmore forgiving of mistakes and are\nespecially eager to give feedback.\nNext, using a technique I call the\nconcierge minimum viable product\n(described in detail in Chapter 6),\nCaroline could make sure the first\nfew participants had an experience\nthat was as good as she could make\nit, completely aligned with her\nvision. Unlike in a focus group, her\ngoal would be to measure what the\ncustomers actually did. For example,\nhow many of the first volunteers\nactually complete their volunteer\nassignments? How many volunteer a\nsecond time? How many are willing\nto recruit a colleague to participate in\na subsequent volunteer activity?\nAdditional experiments can\nexpand on this early feedback and\nlearning. For example, if the growth\nmodel requires that a certain\npercentage of participants share their\nexperiences with colleagues and\nencourage their participation, the\ndegree to which that takes place can\nbe tested even with a very small\nsample of people. If ten people\ncomplete the first experiment, how\nmany do we expect to volunteer\nagain? If they are asked to recruit a\ncolleague, how many do we expect\nwill do so? Remember that these are\nsupposed to be the kinds of early\nadopters with the most to gain from\nthe program.\nPut another way, what if all ten\nearly adopters decline to volunteer\nagain? That would be a highly\nsignificant—and very negative—\nresult. If the numbers from such\nearly experiments don’t look\npromising, there is clearly a problem\nwith the strategy. That doesn’t mean\nit’s time to give up; on the contrary,\nit means it’s time to get some\nimmediate qualitative feedback\nabout how to improve the program.\nHere’s where this kind of\nexperimentation has an advantage\nover traditional market research. We\ndon’t have to commission a survey\nor find new people to interview. We\nalready have a cohort of people to\ntalk to as well as knowledge about\ntheir actual behavior: the participants\nin the initial experiment.\nThis entire experiment could be\nconducted in a matter of weeks, less\nthan one-tenth the time of the\ntraditional strategic planning process.\nAlso, it can happen in parallel with\nstrategic planning while the plan is\nstill being formulated. Even when\nexperiments produce a negative\nresult, those failures prove\ninstructive and can influence the\nstrategy. For example, what if no\nvolunteers can be found who are\nexperiencing the conflict of values\nwithin the organization that was such\nan important assumption in the\nbusiness plan? If so, congratulations:\nit’s time to pivot (a concept that is\nexplored in more detail in Chapter\n8).3\nAN EXPERIMENT IS A\nPRODUCT\nIn the Lean Startup model, an\nexperiment is more than just a\ntheoretical inquiry; it is also a first\nproduct. If this or any other\nexperiment is successful, it allows\nthe manager to get started with his or\nher campaign: enlisting early\nadopters, adding employees to each\nfurther experiment or iteration, and\neventually starting to build a product.\nBy the time that product is ready to\nbe distributed widely, it will already\nhave established customers. It will\nhave solved real problems and offer\ndetailed specifications for what\nneeds to be built. Unlike a traditional\nstrategic planning or market research\nprocess, this specification will be\nrooted in feedback on what is\nworking today rather than in\nanticipation of what might work\ntomorrow.\nTo see this in action, consider an\nexample from Kodak. Kodak’s\nhistory is bound up with cameras and\nfilm, but today it also operates a\nsubstantial online business called\nKodak Gallery. Mark Cook is Kodak\nGallery’s vice president of products,\nand he is working to change Kodak\nGallery’s culture of development to\nembrace experimentation.\nMark explained, “Traditionally,\nthe product manager says, ‘I just\nwant this.’ In response, the engineer\nsays, ‘I’m going to build it.’ Instead,\nI try to push my team to first answer\nfour questions:\n1. Do consumers recognize that\nthey have the problem you\nare trying to solve?\n2. If there was a solution, would\nthey buy it?\n3. Would they buy it from us?\n4. Can we build a solution for\nthat problem?”\nThe common tendency of product\ndevelopment is to skip straight to the\nfourth question and build a solution\nbefore confirming that customers\nhave the problem. For example,\nKodak Gallery offered wedding\ncards with gilded text and graphics\non its site. Those designs were\npopular with customers who were\ngetting married, and so the team\nredesigned the cards to be used at\nother special occasions, such as for\nholidays. The market research and\ndesign process indicated that\ncustomers would like the new cards,\nand that finding justified the\nsignificant effort that went into\ncreating them.\nDays before the launch, the team\nrealized the cards were too difficult\nto understand from their depiction on\nthe website; people couldn’t see how\nbeautiful they were. They were also\nhard to produce. Cook realized that\nthey had done the work backward.\nHe explained, “Until we could figure\nout how to sell and make the\nproduct, it wasn’t worth spending\nany engineering time on.”\nLearning from that experience,\nCook took a different approach when\nhe led his team through the\ndevelopment of a new set of features\nfor a product that makes it easier to\nshare photos taken at an event. They\nbelieved that an online “event\nalbum” would provide a way for\npeople who attended a wedding, a\nconference, or another gathering to\nshare photos with other attendees.\nUnlike other online photo sharing\nservices, Kodak Gallery’s event\nalbum would have strong privacy\ncontrols, assuring that the photos\nwould be shared only with people\nwho attended the same event.\nIn a break with the past, Cook led\nthe group through a process of\nidentifying risks and assumptions\nbefore building anything and then\ntesting those assumptions\nexperimentally.\nThere were two main hypotheses\nunderlying the proposed event\nalbum:\n1. The team assumed that\ncustomers would want to\ncreate the albums in the first\nplace.\n2. It assumed that event\nparticipants would upload\nphotos to event albums\ncreated by friends or\ncolleagues.\nThe Kodak Gallery team built a\nsimple prototype of the event album.\nIt lacked many features—so many, in\nfact, that the team was reluctant to\nshow it to customers. However, even\nat that early stage, allowing\ncustomers to use the prototype\nh e l p e d the team refute their\nhypotheses. First, creating an album\nwas not as easy as the team had\npredicted; none of the early\ncustomers were able to create one.\nFurther, customers complained that\nthe early product version lacked\nessential features.\nThose negative results\ndemoralized the team. The usability\nproblems frustrated them, as did\ncustomer complains about missing\nfeatures, many of which matched the\noriginal road map. Cook explained\nthat even though the product was\nmissing features, the project was not\na failure. The initial product—flaws\nand all—confirmed that users did\nhave the desire to create event\nalbums, which was extremely\nvaluable information. Where\ncustomers complained about missing\nfeatures, this suggested that the team\nwas on the right track. The team now\nhad early evidence that those\nfeatures were in fact important. What\nabout features that were on the road\nmap but that customers didn’t\ncomplain about? Maybe those\nfeatures weren’t as important as they\ninitially seemed.\nThrough a beta launch the team\ncontinued to learn and iterate. While\nthe early users were enthusiastic and\nthe numbers were promising, the\nteam made a major discovery.\nThrough the use of online surveying\ntool KISSinsights, the team learned\nthat many customers wanted to be\nable to arrange the order of pictures\nbefore they would invite others to\ncontribute. Knowing they weren’t\nready to launch, Cook held off his\ndivision’s general manager by\nexplaining how iterating and\nexperimenting before beginning the\nmarketing campaign would yield far\nbetter results. In a world where\nmarketing launch dates were often\nset months in advance, waiting until\nthe team had really solved the\nproblem was a break from the past.\nThis process represented a\ndramatic change for Kodak Gallery;\nemployees were used to being\nmeasured on their progress at\ncompleting tasks. As Cook says,\n“Success is not delivering a feature;\nsuccess is learning how to solve the\ncustomer’s problem.”4\nTHE VILLAGE LAUNDRY\nSERVICE\nIn India, due to the cost of a washing\nmachine, less than seven percent of\nthe population have one in their\nhomes. Most people either hand\nwash their clothing at home or pay a\nDhobi to do it for them. Dhobis take\nthe clothes to the nearest river, wash\nthem in the river water, bang them\nagainst rocks to get them clean, and\nhang them to dry, which takes two to\nseven days. The result? Clothes are\nreturned in about ten days and are\nprobably not that clean.\nAkshay Mehra had been working\nat Procter & Gamble Singapore for\neight years when he sensed an\nopportunity. As the brand manager\nof the Tide and Pantene brands for\nIndia and ASEAN countries, he\nthought he could make laundry\nservices available to people who\npreviously could not afford them.\nReturning to India, Akshay joined\nthe Village Laundry Services (VLS),\ncreated by Innosight Ventures. VLS\nbegan a series of experiments to test\nits business assumptions.\nFor their first experiment, VLS\nmounted a consumer-grade laundry\nmachine on the back of a pickup\ntruck parked on a street corner in\nBangalore. The experiment cost less\nthan $8,000 and had the simple goal\nof proving that people would hand\nover their laundry and pay to have it\ncleaned. The entrepreneurs did not\nclean the laundry on the truck, which\nwas more for marketing and show,\nbut took it off-site to be cleaned and\nbrought it back to their customers by\nthe end of the day.\nThe VLS team continued the\nexperiment for a week, parking the\ntruck on different street corners,\ndigging deeper to discover all they\ncould about their potential\ncustomers. They wanted to know\nhow they could encourage people to\ncome to the truck. Did cleaning\nspeed matter? Was cleanliness a\nconcern? What were people asking\nfor when they left their laundry with\nt h e m ? They discovered that\ncustomers were happy to give them\ntheir laundry to clean. However,\nthose customers were suspicious of\nthe washing machine mounted on the\nback of the truck, concerned that\nVLS would take their laundry and\nrun. To address that concern, VLS\ncreated a slightly more substantial\nmobile cart that looked more like a\nkiosk.\nVLS also experimented with\nparking the carts in front of a local\nminimarket chain. Further iterations\nhelped VLS figure out which\nservices people were most interested\nin and what price they were willing\nto pay. They discovered that\ncustomers often wanted their clothes\nironed and were willing to pay\ndouble the price to get their laundry\nback in four hours rather than\ntwenty-four hours.\nAs a result of those early\nexperiments, VLS created an end\nproduct that was a three-foot by fourfoot mobile kiosk that included an\nenergy-efficient, consumer-grade\nwashing machine, a dryer, and an\nextra-long extension cord. The kiosk\nused Western detergents and was\nsupplied daily with fresh clean water\ndelivered by VLS.\nSince then, the Village Laundry\nService has grown substantially, with\nfourteen locations operational in\nBangalore, Mysore, and Mumbai. As\nCEO Akshay Mehra shared with me,\n“We have serviced 116,000 kgs. in\n2010 (vs. 30,600 kg. in 2009). And\nalmost 60 percent of the business is\ncoming from repeat customers. We\nhave serviced more than 10,000\ncustomers in the past year alone\nacross all the outlets.”5\nA LEAN STARTUP IN\nGOVERNMENT?\nOn July 21, 2010, President Obama\nsigned the Dodd–Frank Wall Street\nReform and Consumer Protection\nAct into law. One of its landmark\nprovisions created a new federal\nagency, the Consumer Federal\nProtection Bureau (CFPB). This\nagency is tasked with protecting\nAmerican citizens from predatory\nlending by financial services\ncompanies such as credit card\ncompanies, student lenders, and\npayday loan offices. The plan calls\nfor it to accomplish this by setting up\na call center where trained case\nworkers will field calls directly from\nthe public.\nLeft to its own devices, a new\ngovernment agency would probably\nhire a large staff with a large budget\nto develop a plan that is expensive\nand time-consuming. However, the\nCFPB is considering doing things\ndifferently. Despite its $500 million\nbudget and high-profile origins, the\nCPFB is really a startup.\nPresident Obama tasked his chief\ntechnology officer, Aneesh Chopra,\nwith collecting ideas for how to set\nup the new startup agency, and that\nis how I came to be involved. On one\nof Chopra’s visits to Silicon Valley,\nhe invited a number of entrepreneurs\nto make suggestions for ways to\ncultivate a startup mentality in the\nnew agency. In particular, his focus\nwas on leveraging technology and\ninnovation to make the agency more\nefficient, cost-effective, and\nthorough.\nMy suggestion was drawn straight\nfrom the principles of this chapter:\ntreat the CFPB as an experiment,\nidentify the elements of the plan that\nare assumptions rather than facts,\nand figure out ways to test them.\nUsing these insights, we could build\na minimum viable product and have\nthe agency up and running—on a\nmicro scale—long before the official\nplan was set in motion.\nThe number one assumption\nunderlying the current plan is that\nonce Americans know they can call\nthe CFPB for help with financial\nfraud and abuse, there will be a\nsignificant volume of citizens who\ndo that. This sounds reasonable, as it\nis based on market research about\nthe amount of fraud that affects\nAmericans each year. However,\ndespite all that research, it is still an\nassumption. If the actual call volume\ndiffers markedly from that in the\nplan, it will require significant\nrevision. What if Americans who are\nsubjected to financial abuse don’t\nview themselves as victims and\ntherefore don’t seek help? What if\nthey have very different notions of\nwhat problems are important? What\nif they call the agency seeking help\nfor problems that are outside its\npurview?\nOnce the agency is up and running\nwith a $500 million budget and a\ncorrespondingly large staff, altering\nthe plan will be expensive and timeconsuming, but why wait to get\nfeedback? To start experimenting\nimmediately, the agency could start\nwith the creation of a simple hotline\nnumber, using one of the new breed\nof low-cost and fast setup platforms\nsuch as Twilio. With a few hours’\nwork, they could add simple voice\nprompts, offering callers a menu of\nfinancial problems to choose from.\nIn the first version, the prompts\ncould be drawn straight from the\nexisting research. Instead of a\ncaseworker on the line, each prompt\ncould offer the caller useful\ninformation about how to solve her\nor his problem.\nInstead of marketing this hotline to\nthe whole country, the agency could\nrun the experiment in a much more\nlimited way: start with a small\ngeographic area, perhaps as small as\na few city blocks, and instead of\npaying for expensive television or\nradio advertising to let people know\nabout the service, use highly targeted\nadvertising. Flyers on billboards,\nnewspaper advertisements to those\nblocks, or specially targeted online\nads would be a good start. Since the\ntarget area is so small, they could\nafford to pay a premium to create a\nhigh level of awareness in the target\nzone. The total cost would remain\nquite small.\nAs a comprehensive solution to\nthe problem of financial abuse, this\nminimum viable product is not very\ngood compared with what a $500\nmillion agency could accomplish.\nBut it is also not very expensive.\nThis product could be built in a\nmatter of days or weeks, and the\nwhole experiment probably would\ncost only a few thousand dollars.\nWhat we would learn from this\nexperiment would be invaluable. On\nthe basis of the selections of those\nfirst callers, the agency could\nimmediately start to get a sense of\nwhat kinds of problems Americans\nbelieve they have, not just what they\n“should” have. The agency could\nbegin to test marketing messages:\nWhat motivates people to call? It\ncould start to extrapolate real-world\ntrends: What percentage of people in\nthe target area actually call? The\nextrapolation would not be perfect,\nbut it would establish a baseline\nbehavior that would be far more\naccurate than market research.\nMost important, this product\nwould serve as a seed that could\ngerminate into a much more\nelaborate service. With this\nbeginning, the agency could engage\nin a continuous process of\nimprovement, slowly but surely\nadding more and better solutions.\nEventually, it would staff the hotline\nwith caseworkers, perhaps at first\naddressing only one category of\nproblems, to give the caseworkers\nthe best chance of success. By the\ntime the official plan was ready for\nimplementation, this early service\ncould serve as a real-world template.\nThe CFPB is just getting started,\nbut already they are showing signs of\nfollowing an experimental approach.\nFor example, instead of doing a\ngeographically limited rollout, they\nare segmenting their first products by\nuse case. They have established a\npreliminary order of financial\nproducts to provide consumer\nservices for, with credit cards\ncoming first. As their first\nexperiment unfolds, they will have\nthe opportunity to closely monitor all\nof the other complaints and\nconsumer feedback they receive.\nThis data will influence the depth,\nbreadth, and sequence of future\nofferings.\nAs David Forrest, the CFPB’s\nchief technology officer, told me,\n“Our goal is to give American\ncitizens an easy way to tell us about\nthe problems they see out there in the\nconsumer financial marketplace. We\nhave an opportunity to closely\nmonitor what the public is telling us\nand react to new information.\nMarkets change all the time and our\njob is to change with them.”6\nThe entrepreneurs and managers\nprofiled in this book are smart,\ncapable, and extremely resultsoriented. In many cases, they are in\nthe midst of building an organization\nin a way consistent with the best\npractices of current management\nthinking. They face the same\nchallenges in both the public and\nprivate sectors, regardless of\nindustry. As we’ve seen, even the\nseasoned managers and executives at\nthe world’s best-run companies\nstruggle to consistently develop and\nlaunch innovative new products.\nTheir challenge is to overcome the\nprevailing management thinking that\nputs its faith in well-researched\nplans. Remember, planning is a tool\nthat only works in the presence of a\nlong and stable operating history.\nAnd yet, do any of us feel that the\nworld around us is getting more and\nmore stable every day? Changing\nsuch a mind-set is hard but critical to\nstartup success. My hope is that this\nbook will help managers and\nentrepreneurs make this change.\nPart Two\nSTEER\nHow Vision Leads to Steering\nAt its heart, a startup is a catalyst\nthat transforms ideas into products.\nAs customers interact with those\nproducts, they generate feedback and\ndata. The feedback is both qualitative\n(such as what they like and don’t\nlike) and quantitative (such as how\nmany people use it and find it\nvaluable). As we saw in Part One,\nthe products a startup builds are\nreally experiments; the learning\nabout how to build a sustainable\nbusiness is the outcome of those\nexperiments. For startups, that\ninformation is much more important\nthan dollars, awards, or mentions in\nthe press, because it can influence\nand reshape the next set of ideas.\nWe can visualize this three-step\nprocess with this simple diagram:\nThis Build-Measure-Learn\nfeedback loop is at the core of the\nLean Startup model. In Part Two, we\nwill examine it in great detail.\nMany people have professional\ntraining that emphasizes one element\nof this feedback loop. For engineers,\nit’s learning to build things as\nefficiently as possible. Some\nmanagers are experts at strategizing\nand learning at the whiteboard.\nPlenty of entrepreneurs focus their\nenergies on the individual nouns:\nhaving the best product idea or the\nbest-designed initial product or\nobsessing over data and metrics. The\ntruth is that none of these activities\nby itself is of paramount importance.\nInstead, we need to focus our\nenergies on minimizing the total time\nthrough this feedback loop. This is\nthe essence of steering a startup and\nis the subject of Part Two. We will\nwalk through a complete turn of the\nBuild-Measure-Learn feedback loop,\ndiscussing each of the components in\ndetail.\nThe purpose of Part One was to\nexplore the importance of learning as\nthe measure of progress for a startup.\nAs I hope is evident by now, by\nfocusing our energies on validated\nlearning, we can avoid much of the\nwaste that plagues startups today. As\nin lean manufacturing, learning\nwhere and when to invest energy\nresults in saving time and money.\nTo apply the scientific method to a\nstartup, we need to identify which\nhypotheses to test. I call the riskiest\nelements of a startup’s plan, the parts\non which everything depends, leapof-faith assumptions. The two most\nimportant assumptions are the value\nhypothesis and the growth\nhypothesis. These give rise to tuning\nvariables that control a startup’s\nengine of growth. Each iteration of a\nstartup is an attempt to rev this\nengine to see if it will turn. Once it is\nrunning, the process repeats, shifting\ninto higher and higher gears.\nOnce clear on these leap-of-faith\nassumptions, the first step is to enter\nthe Build phase as quickly as\npossible with a minimum viable\nproduct (MVP). The MVP is that\nversion of the product that enables a\nfull turn of the Build-Measure-Learn\nloop with a minimum amount of\neffort and the least amount of\ndevelopment time. The minimum\nviable product lacks many features\nthat may prove essential later on.\nHowever, in some ways, creating a\nMVP requires extra work: we must\nbe able to measure its impact. For\nexample, it is inadequate to build a\nprototype that is evaluated solely for\ninternal quality by engineers and\ndesigners. We also need to get it in\nfront of potential customers to gauge\ntheir reactions. We may even need to\ntry selling them the prototype, as\nwe’ll soon see.\nWhen we enter the Measure\nphase, the biggest challenge will be\ndetermining whether the product\ndevelopment efforts are leading to\nreal progress. Remember, if we’re\nbuilding something that nobody\nwants, it doesn’t much matter if\nwe’re doing it on time and on\nbudget. The method I recommend is\nc a l l e d innovation accounting, a\nquantitative approach that allows us\nto see whether our engine-tuning\nefforts are bearing fruit. It also\nallows us to create learning\nmilestones, which are an alternative\nto traditional business and product\nmilestones. Learning milestones are\nuseful for entrepreneurs as a way of\nassessing their progress accurately\nand objectively; they are also\ninvaluable to managers and investors\nwho must hold entrepreneurs\naccountable. However, not all\nmetrics are created equal, and in\nChapter 7 I’ll clarify the danger of\nvanity metrics in contrast to the nutsand-bolts usefulness of actionable\nmetrics, which help to analyze\ncustomer behavior in ways that\nsupport innovation accounting.\nFinally, and most important,\nthere’s the pivot. Upon completing\nthe Build-Measure-Learn loop, we\nconfront the most difficult question\nany entrepreneur faces: whether to\npivot the original strategy or\npersevere. If we’ve discovered that\none of our hypotheses is false, it is\ntime to make a major change to a\nnew strategic hypothesis.\nThe Lean Startup method builds\ncapital-efficient companies because\nit allows startups to recognize that\nit’s time to pivot sooner, creating\nless waste of time and money.\nAlthough we write the feedback loop\nas Build-Measure-Learn because the\nactivities happen in that order, our\nplanning really works in the reverse\norder: we figure out what we need to\nlearn, use innovation accounting to\nfigure out what we need to measure\nto know if we are gaining validated\nlearning, and then figure out what\nproduct we need to build to run that\nexperiment and get that\nmeasurement. All of the techniques\ni n Part Two are designed to\nminimize the total time through the\nBuild-Measure-Learn feedback loop.\n5\nLEAP\nIn 2004, three college sophomores\narrived in Silicon Valley with their\nfledgling college social network. It\nwas live on a handful of college\ncampuses. It was not the marketleading social network or even the\nfirst college social network; other\ncompanies had launched sooner and\nwith more features. With 150,000\nregistered users, it made very little\nrevenue, yet that summer they raised\ntheir first $500,000 in venture\ncapital. Less than a year later, they\nraised an additional $12.7 million.\nOf course, by now you’ve guessed\nthat these three college sophomores\nwere Mark Zuckerberg, Dustin\nMoskovitz, and Chris Hughes of\nFacebook. Their story is now world\nfamous. Many things about it are\nremarkable, but I’d like to focus on\nonly one: how Facebook was able to\nraise so much money when its actual\nusage was so small.1\nBy all accounts, what impressed\ninvestors the most were two facts\nabout Facebook’s early growth. The\nfirst fact was the raw amount of time\nFacebook’s active users spent on the\nsite. More than half of the users\ncame back to the site every single\nday.2 This is an example of how a\ncompany can validate its value\nhypothesis—that customers find the\nproduct valuable. The second\nimpressive thing about Facebook’s\nearly traction was the rate at which it\nhad taken over its first few college\ncampuses. The rate of growth was\nstaggering: Facebook launched on\nFebruary 4, 2004, and by the end of\nthat month almost three-quarters of\nHarvard’s undergraduates were using\nit, without a dollar of marketing or\nadvertising having been spent. In\nother words, Facebook also had\nvalidated its growth hypothesis.\nThese two hypotheses represent two\nof the most important leap-of-faith\nquestions any new startup faces.3\nAt the time, I heard many people\ncriticize Facebook’s early investors,\nclaiming that Facebook had “no\nbusiness model” and only modest\nrevenues relative to the valuation\noffered by its investors. They saw in\nFacebook a return to the excesses of\nthe dot-com era, when companies\nwith little revenue raised massive\namounts of cash to pursue a strategy\nof “attracting eyeballs” and “getting\nbig fast.” Many dot-com-era startups\nplanned to make money later by\nselling the eyeballs they had bought\nto other advertisers. In truth, those\ndot-com failures were little more\nthan middlemen, effectively paying\nmoney to acquire customers’\nattention and then planning to resell\nit to others. Facebook was different,\nbecause it employed a different\nengine of growth. It paid nothing for\ncustomer acquisition, and its high\nengagement meant that it was\naccumulating massive amounts of\ncustomer attention every day. There\nwas never any question that attention\nwould be valuable to advertisers; the\nonly question was how much they\nwould pay.\nMany entrepreneurs are\nattempting to build the next\nFacebook, yet when they try to apply\nthe lessons of Facebook and other\nfamous startup success stories, they\nquickly get confused. Is the lesson of\nFacebook that startups should not\ncharge customers money in the early\ndays? Or is it that startups should\nnever spend money on marketing?\nThese questions cannot be answered\nin the abstract; there are an almost\ninfinite number of counterexamples\nfor any technique. Instead, as we saw\nin Part One, startups need to conduct\nexperiments that help determine\nwhat techniques will work in their\nunique circumstances. For startups,\nthe role of strategy is to help figure\nout the right questions to ask.\nSTRATEGY IS BASED ON\nASSUMPTIONS\nEvery business plan begins with a set\nof assumptions. It lays out a strategy\nthat takes those assumptions as a\ngiven and proceeds to show how to\nachieve the company’s vision.\nBecause the assumptions haven’t\nbeen proved to be true (they are\nassumptions, after all) and in fact are\noften erroneous, the goal of a\nstartup’s early efforts should be to\ntest them as quickly as possible.\nWhat traditional business strategy\nexcels at is helping managers\nidentify clearly what assumptions are\nbeing made in a particular business.\nThe first challenge for an\nentrepreneur is to build an\norganization that can test these\nassumptions systematically. The\nsecond challenge, as in all\nentrepreneurial situations, is to\nperform that rigorous testing without\nlosing sight of the company’s overall\nvision.\nMany assumptions in a typical\nbusiness plan are unexceptional.\nThese are well-established facts\ndrawn from past industry experience\nor straightforward deductions. In\nFacebook’s case, it was clear that\nadvertisers would pay for customers’\nattention. Hidden among these\nmundane details are a handful of\nassumptions that require more\ncourage to state—in the present tense\n—with a straight face: we assume\nthat customers have a significant\ndesire to use a product like ours, or\nwe assume that supermarkets will\ncarry our product. Acting as if these\nassumptions are true is a classic\nentrepreneur superpower. They are\nc a l l e d leaps of faith precisely\nbecause the success of the entire\nventure rests on them. If they are\ntrue, tremendous opportunity awaits.\nIf they are false, the startup risks\ntotal failure.\nMost leaps of faith take the form\nof an argument by analogy. For\nexample, one business plan I\nremember argued as follows: “Just as\nthe development of progressive\nimage loading allowed the\nwidespread use of the World Wide\nWeb over dial-up, so too our\nprogressive rendering technology\nwill allow our product to run on lowend personal computers.” You\nprobably have no idea what\nprogressive image loading or\nrendering is, and it doesn’t much\nmatter. But you know the argument\n(perhaps you’ve even used it):\nPrevious technology X was\nused to win market Y because\nof attribute Z. We have a new\ntechnology X2 that will enable\nus to win market Y2 because\nwe too have attribute Z.\nThe problem with analogies like\nthis is that they obscure the true leap\nof faith. That is their goal: to make\nthe business seem less risky. They\nare used to persuade investors,\nemployees, or partners to sign on.\nMost entrepreneurs would cringe to\nsee their leap of faith written this\nway:\nLarge numbers of people\nalready wanted access to the\nWorld Wide Web. They knew\nwhat it was, they could afford it,\nbut they could not get access to\nit because the time it took to\nload images was too long.\nWhen progressive image\nloading was introduced, it\nallowed people to get onto the\nWorld Wide Web and tell their\nfriends about it. Thus, company\nX won market Y.\nSimilarly, there is already a\nlarge number of potential\ncustomers who want access to\nour product right now. They\nknow they want it, they can\nafford it, but they cannot access\nit because the rendering is too\nslow. When we debut our\nproduct with progressive\nrendering technology, they will\nflock to our software and tell\ntheir friends, and we will win\nmarket Y2.\nThere are several things to notice\nin this revised statement. First, it’s\nimportant to identify the facts\nclearly. Is it really true that\nprogressive image loading caused\nthe adoption of the World Wide\nWeb, or was this just one factor\namong many? More important, is it\nreally true that there are large\nnumbers of potential customers out\nthere who want our solution right\nnow? The earlier analogy was\ndesigned to convince stakeholders\nthat a reasonable first step is to build\nthe new startup’s technology and see\nif customers will use it. The restated\napproach should make clear that\nwhat is needed is to do some\nempirical testing first: let’s make\nsure that there really are hungry\ncustomers out there eager to embrace\nour new technology.\nAnalogs and Antilogs\nThere is nothing intrinsically wrong\nwith basing strategy on comparisons\nto other companies and industries. In\nfact, that approach can help you\ndiscover assumptions that are not\nreally leaps of faith. For example, the\nventure capitalist Randy Komisar,\nwhose book Getting to Plan B\ndiscussed the concept of leaps of\nfaith in great detail, uses a\nframework of “analogs” and\n“antilogs” to plot strategy.\nHe explains the analog-antilog\nconcept by using the iPod as an\nexample. “If you were looking for\nanalogs, you would have to look at\nthe Walkman,” he says. “It solved a\ncritical question that Steve Jobs\nnever had to ask himself: Will people\nlisten to music in a public place\nusing earphones? We think of that as\na nonsense question today, but it is\nfundamental. When Sony asked the\nquestion, they did not have the\nanswer. Steve Jobs had [the answer]\nin the analog [version]” Sony’s\nWalkman was the analog. Jobs then\nhad to face the fact that although\npeople were willing to download\nmusic, they were not willing to pay\nfor it. “Napster was an antilog. That\nantilog had to lead him to address his\nbusiness in a particular way,”\nKomisar says. “Out of these analogs\nand antilogs come a series of unique,\nunanswered questions. Those are\nleaps of faith that I, as an\nentrepreneur, am taking if I go\nthrough with this business venture.\nThey are going to make or break my\nbusiness. In the iPod business, one of\nthose leaps of faith was that people\nwould pay for music.” Of course that\nleap of faith turned out to be\ncorrect.4\nBeyond “The Right Place at the\nRight Time”\nThere are any number of famous\nentrepreneurs who made millions\nbecause they seemed to be in the\nright place at the right time.\nHowever, for every successful\nentrepreneur who was in the right\nplace in the right time, there are\nmany more who were there, too, in\nthat right place at the right time but\nstill managed to fail. Henry Ford was\njoined by nearly five hundred other\nentrepreneurs in the early twentieth\ncentury. Imagine being an\nautomobile entrepreneur, trained in\nstate-of-the-art engineering, on the\nground floor of one of the biggest\nmarket opportunities in history. Yet\nthe vast majority managed to make\nno money at all.5 We saw the same\nphenomenon with Facebook, which\nfaced early competition from other\ncollege-based social networks whose\nhead start proved irrelevant.\nWhat differentiates the success\nstories from the failures is that the\nsuccessful entrepreneurs had the\nforesight, the ability, and the tools to\ndiscover which parts of their plans\nwere working brilliantly and which\nwere misguided, and adapt their\nstrategies accordingly.\nValue and Growth\nAs we saw in the Facebook story,\ntwo leaps of faith stand above all\nothers: the value creation hypothesis\nand the growth hypothesis. The first\nstep in understanding a new product\nor service is to figure out if it is\nfundamentally value-creating or\nvalue-destroying. I use the language\nof economics in referring to value\nrather than profit, because\nentrepreneurs include people who\nstart not-for-profit social ventures,\nthose in public sector startups, and\ninternal change agents who do not\njudge their success by profit alone.\nEven more confusing, there are many\norganizations that are wildly\nprofitable in the short term but\nultimately value-destroying, such as\nthe organizers of Ponzi schemes, and\nfraudulent or misguided companies\n(e.g., Enron and Lehman Brothers).\nA similar thing is true for growth.\nAs with value, it’s essential that\nentrepreneurs understand the reasons\nbehind a startup’s growth. There are\nmany value-destroying kinds of\ngrowth that should be avoided. An\nexample would be a business that\ngrows through continuous fundraising from investors and lots of\npaid advertising but does not develop\na value-creating product.\nSuch businesses are engaged in\nwhat I call success theater, using the\nappearance of growth to make it\nseem that they are successful. One of\nthe goals of innovation accounting,\nwhich is discussed in depth in\nChapter 7, is to help differentiate\nthese false startups from true\ninnovators. Traditional accounting\njudges new ventures by the same\nstandards it uses for established\ncompanies, but these indications are\nnot reliable predictors of a startup’s\nfuture prospects. Consider\ncompanies such as Amazon.com that\nracked up huge losses on their way\nto breakthrough success.\nLike its traditional counterpart,\ninnovation accounting requires that a\nstartup have and maintain a\nquantitative financial model that can\nbe used to evaluate progress\nrigorously. However, in a startup’s\nearliest days, there is not enough\ndata to make an informed guess\nabout what this model might look\nlike. A startup’s earliest strategic\nplans are likely to be hunch- or\nintuition-guided, and that is a good\nthing. To translate those instincts\ninto data, entrepreneurs must, in\nSteve Blank’s famous phrase, “get\nout of the building” and start\nlearning.\nGENCHI GEMBUTSU\nThe importance of basing strategic\ndecisions on firsthand understanding\nof customers is one of the core\nprinciples that underlies the Toyota\nProduction System. At Toyota, this\ngoes by the Japanese term genchi\ngembutsu, which is one of the most\nimportant phrases in the lean\nmanufacturing vocabulary. In\nEnglish, it is usually translated as a\ndirective to “go and see for yourself”\nso that business decisions can be\nbased on deep firsthand knowledge.\nJeffrey Liker, who has extensively\ndocumented the “Toyota Way,”\nexplains it this way:\nIn my Toyota interviews, when\nI asked what distinguishes the\nToyota Way from other\nmanagement approaches, the\nmost common first response\nwas genchi gembutsu—whether\nI was in manufacturing, product\ndevelopment, sales, distribution,\nor public affairs. You cannot be\nsure you really understand any\npart of any business problem\nunless you go and see for\nyourself firsthand. It is\nunacceptable to take anything\nfor granted or to rely on the\nreports of others.6\nTo demonstrate, take a look at the\ndevelopment of Toyota’s Sienna\nminivan for the 2004 model year. At\nToyota, the manager responsible for\nthe design and development of a new\nmodel is called the chief engineer, a\ncross-functional leader who oversees\nthe entire process from concept to\nproduction. The 2004 Sienna was\nassigned to Yuji Yokoya, who had\nvery little experience in North\nAmerica, which was the Sienna’s\nprimary market. To figure out how to\nimprove the minivan, he proposed an\naudacious entrepreneurial\nundertaking: a road trip spanning all\nfifty U.S. states, all thirteen\nprovinces and territories of Canada,\nand all parts of Mexico. In all, he\nlogged more than 53,000 miles of\ndriving. In small towns and large\ncities, Yokoya would rent a currentmodel Sienna, driving it in addition\nto talking to and observing real\ncustomers. From those firsthand\nobservations, Yokoya was able to\nstart testing his critical assumptions\nabout what North American\nconsumers wanted in a minivan.\nIt is common to think of selling to\nconsumers as easier than selling to\nenterprises, because customers lack\nthe complexity of multiple\ndepartments and different people\nplaying different roles in the\npurchasing process. Yokoya\ndiscovered this was untrue for his\ncustomers: “The parents and\ngrandparents may own the minivan.\nBut it’s the kids who rule it. It’s the\nkids who occupy the rear two-thirds\nof the vehicle. And it’s the kids who\nare the most critical—and the most\nappreciative of their environment. If\nI learned anything in my travels, it\nwas the new Sienna would need kid\nappeal.”7 Identifying these\nassumptions helped guide the car’s\ndevelopment. For example, Yokoya\nspent an unusual amount of the\nSienna’s development budget on\ninternal comfort features, which are\ncritical to a long-distance family road\ntrip (such trips are much more\ncommon in America than in Japan).\nThe results were impressive,\nboosting the Sienna’s market share\ndramatically. The 2004 model’s sales\nwere 60 percent higher than those in\n2003. Of course, a product like the\nSienna is a classic sustaining\ninnovation, the kind that the world’s\nbest-managed established\ncompanies, such as Toyota, excel at.\nEntrepreneurs face a different set of\nchallenges because they operate with\nmuch higher uncertainty. While a\ncompany working on a sustaining\ninnovation knows enough about who\nand where their customers are to use\ngenchi gembutsu to discover what\ncustomers want, startups’ early\ncontact with potential customers\nmerely reveals what assumptions\nrequire the most urgent testing.\nGET OUT OF THE BUILDING\nNumbers tell a compelling story, but\nI always remind entrepreneurs that\nmetrics are people, too. No matter\nhow many intermediaries lie between\na company and its customers, at the\nend of the day, customers are\nbreathing, thinking, buying\nindividuals. Their behavior is\nmeasurable and changeable. Even\nwhen one is selling to large\ninstitutions, as in a business-tobusiness model, it helps to remember\nthat those businesses are made up of\nindividuals. All successful sales\nmodels depend on breaking down the\nmonolithic view of organizations\ninto the disparate people that make\nthem up.\nAs Steve Blank has been teaching\nentrepreneurs for years, the facts that\nwe need to gather about customers,\nmarkets, suppliers, and channels\nexist only “outside the building.”\nStartups need extensive contact with\npotential customers to understand\nthem, so get out of your chair and get\nto know them.\nThe first step in this process is to\nconfirm that your leap-of-faith\nquestions are based in reality, that\nthe customer has a significant\nproblem worth solving.8 When Scott\nCook conceived Intuit in 1982, he\nhad a vision—at that time quite\nradical—that someday consumers\nwould use personal computers to pay\nbills and keep track of expenses.\nWhen Cook left his consulting job to\ntake the entrepreneurial plunge, he\ndidn’t start with stacks of market\nresearch or in-depth analysis at the\nwhiteboard. Instead, he picked up\ntwo phone books: one for Palo Alto,\nCalifornia, where he was living at\nthe time, and the other for Winnetka,\nIllinois.\nCalling people at random, he\ninquired if he could ask them a few\nquestions about the way they\nmanaged their finances. Those early\nconversations were designed to\nanswer this leap-of-faith question: do\npeople find it frustrating to pay bills\nby hand? It turned out that they did,\nand this early validation gave Cook\nthe confirmation he needed to get\nstarted on a solution.9\nThose early conversations did not\ndelve into the product features of a\nproposed solution; that attempt\nwould have been foolish. The\naverage consumers at that time were\nnot conversant enough with personal\ncomputers to have an opinion about\nwhether they’d want to use them in a\nnew way. Those early conversations\nwere with mainstream customers, not\nearly adopters. Still, the\nconversations yielded a fundamental\ninsight: if Intuit could find a way to\nsolve this problem, there could be a\nlarge mainstream audience on which\nit could build a significant business.\nDesign and the Customer\nArchetype\nThe goal of such early contact with\ncustomers is not to gain definitive\nanswers. Instead, it is to clarify at a\nbasic, coarse level that we\nunderstand our potential customer\nand what problems they have. With\nthat understanding, we can craft a\ncustomer archetype, a brief\ndocument that seeks to humanize the\nproposed target customer. This\narchetype is an essential guide for\nproduct development and ensures\nthat the daily prioritization decisions\nthat every product team must make\nare aligned with the customer to\nwhom the company aims to appeal.\nThere are many techniques for\nbuilding an accurate customer\narchetype that have been developed\nover long years of practice in the\ndesign community. Traditional\napproaches such as interaction\ndesign or design thinking are\nenormously helpful. To me, it has\nalways seemed ironic that many of\nthese approaches are highly\nexperimental and iterative, using\ntechniques such as rapid prototyping\nand in-person customer observations\nto guide designers’ work. Yet\nbecause of the way design agencies\ntraditionally have been compensated,\nall this work culminates in a\nmonolithic deliverable to the client.\nAll of a sudden, the rapid learning\nand experimentation stops; the\nassumption is that the designers have\nlearned all there is to know. For\nstartups, this is an unworkable\nmodel. No amount of design can\nanticipate the many complexities of\nbringing a product to life in the real\nworld.\nIn fact, a new breed of designers is\ndeveloping brand-new techniques\nunder the banner of Lean User\nExperience (Lean UX). They\nrecognize that the customer\narchetype is a hypothesis, not a fact.\nThe customer profile should be\nconsidered provisional until the\nstrategy has shown via validated\nlearning that we can serve this type\nof customer in a sustainable way.10\nANALYSIS PARALYSIS\nThere are two ever-present dangers\nwhen entrepreneurs conduct market\nresearch and talk to customers.\nFollowers of the just-do-it school of\nentrepreneurship are impatient to get\nstarted and don’t want to spend time\nanalyzing their strategy. They’d\nrather start building immediately,\noften after just a few cursory\ncustomer conversations.\nUnfortunately, because customers\ndon’t really know what they want,\nit’s easy for these entrepreneurs to\ndelude themselves that they are on\nthe right path.\nOther entrepreneurs can fall victim\nto analysis paralysis, endlessly\nrefining their plans. In this case,\ntalking to customers, reading\nresearch reports, and whiteboard\nstrategizing are all equally unhelpful.\nThe problem with most\nentrepreneurs’ plans is generally not\nthat they don’t follow sound strategic\nprinciples but that the facts upon\nwhich they are based are wrong.\nUnfortunately, most of these errors\ncannot be detected at the whiteboard\nbecause they depend on the subtle\ninteractions between products and\ncustomers.\nIf too much analysis is dangerous\nbut none can lead to failure, how do\nentrepreneurs know when to stop\nanalyzing and start building? The\nanswer is a concept called the\nminimum viable product, the subject\nof Chapter 6.\n6\nTEST\nGroupon is one of the fastestgrowing companies of all time. Its\nname comes from “group coupons,”\nan ingenious idea that has spawned\nan entire industry of social\ncommerce imitators. However, it\ndidn’t start out successful. When\ncustomers took Groupon up on its\nfirst deal, a whopping twenty people\nbought two-for-one pizza in a\nrestaurant on the first floor of the\ncompany’s Chicago offices—hardly\na world-changing event.\nIn fact, Groupon wasn’t originally\nmeant to be about commerce at all.\nThe founder, Andrew Mason,\nintended his company to become a\n“collective activism platform” called\nThe Point. Its goal was to bring\npeople together to solve problems\nthey couldn’t solve on their own,\nsuch as fund-raising for a cause or\nboycotting a certain retailer. The\nPoint’s early results were\ndisappointing, however, and at the\nend of 2008 the founders decided to\ntry something new. Although they\nstill had grand ambitions, they were\ndetermined to keep the new product\nsimple. They built a minimum viable\nproduct. Does this sound like a\nbillion-dollar company to you?\nMason tells the story:\nWe took a WordPress Blog and\nwe skinned it to say Groupon\nand then every day we would do\na new post. It was totally ghetto.\nWe would sell T-shirts on the\nfirst version of Groupon. We’d\nsay in the write-up, “This Tshirt will come in the color red,\nsize large. If you want a\ndifferent color or size, e-mail\nthat to us.” We didn’t have a\nform to add that stuff. It was\njust so cobbled together.\nIt was enough to prove the\nconcept and show that it was\nsomething that people really\nliked. The actual coupon\ngeneration that we were doing\nwas all FileMaker. We would\nrun a script that would e-mail\nthe coupon PDF to people. It\ngot to the point where we’d sell\n500 sushi coupons in a day, and\nwe’d send 500 PDFs to people\nwith Apple Mail at the same\ntime. Really until July of the\nfirst year it was just a\nscrambling to grab the tiger by\nthe tail. It was trying to catch up\nand reasonably piece together a\nproduct.1\nHandmade PDFs, a pizza coupon,\nand a simple blog were enough to\nlaunch Groupon into record-breaking\nsuccess; it is on pace to become the\nfastest company in history to achieve\n$1 billion in sales. It is\nrevolutionizing the way local\nbusinesses find new customers,\noffering special deals to consumers\nin more than 375 cities worldwide.2\nA minimum viable product (MVP)\nhelps entrepreneurs start the process\nof learning as quickly as possible.3 It\nis not necessarily the smallest\nproduct imaginable, though; it is\nsimply the fastest way to get through\nthe Build-Measure-Learn feedback\nloop with the minimum amount of\neffort.\nContrary to traditional product\ndevelopment, which usually involves\na long, thoughtful incubation period\nand strives for product perfection,\nthe goal of the MVP is to begin the\nprocess of learning, not end it.\nUnlike a prototype or concept test,\na n MVP is designed not just to\nanswer product design or technical\nquestions. Its goal is to test\nfundamental business hypotheses.\nWHY FIRST PRODUCTS\nAREN’T MEANT TO BE\nPERFECT\nAt IMVU, when we were raising\nmoney from venture investors, we\nwere embarrassed. First of all, our\nproduct was still buggy and lowquality. Second, although we were\nproud of our business results, they\nweren’t exactly earth-shattering. The\ngood news was that we were on a\nhockey-stick-shaped growth curve.\nThe bad news was that the hockey\nstick went up to only about $8,000\nper month of revenue. These\nnumbers were so low that we’d often\nhave investors ask us, “What are the\nunits on these charts? Are those\nnumbers in thousands?” We’d have\nto reply, “No, sir, those are in ones.”\nHowever, those early results were\nextremely significant in predicting\nIMVU’s future path. As you’ll see in\nChapter 7, we were able to validate\ntwo of our leap-of-faith assumptions:\nIMVU was providing value for\ncustomers, and we had a working\nengine of growth. The gross numbers\nwere small because we were selling\nthe product to visionary early\ncustomers called early adopters.\nBefore new products can be sold\nsuccessfully to the mass market, they\nhave to be sold to early adopters.\nThese people are a special breed of\ncustomer. They accept—in fact\nprefer—an 80 percent solution; you\ndon’t need a perfect solution to\ncapture their interest.4\nEarly technology adopters lined up\naround the block for Apple’s original\niPhone even though it lacked basic\nfeatures such as copy and paste, 3G\nInternet speed, and support for\ncorporate e-mail. Google’s original\nsearch engine could answer queries\nabout specialized topics such as\nStanford University and the Linux\noperating system, but it would be\nyears before it could “organize the\nworld’s information.” However, this\ndid not stop early adopters from\nsinging its praises.\nEarly adopters use their\nimagination to fill in what a product\nis missing. They prefer that state of\naffairs, because what they care about\nabove all is being the first to use or\nadopt a new product or technology.\nIn consumer products, it’s often the\nthrill of being the first one on the\nblock to show off a new basketball\nshoe, music player, or cool phone. In\nenterprise products, it’s often about\ngaining a competitive advantage by\ntaking a risk with something new\nthat competitors don’t have yet.\nEarly adopters are suspicious of\nsomething that is too polished: if it’s\nready for everyone to adopt, how\nmuch advantage can one get by\nbeing early? As a result, additional\nfeatures or polish beyond what early\nadopters demand is a form of wasted\nresources and time.\nThis is a hard truth for many\nentrepreneurs to accept. After all, the\nvision entrepreneurs keep in their\nheads is of a high-quality\nmainstream product that will change\nthe world, not one used by a small\nniche of people who are willing to\ngive it a shot before it’s ready. That\nworld-changing product is polished,\nslick, and ready for prime time. It\nwins awards at trade shows and,\nmost of all, is something you can\nproudly show Mom and Dad. An\nearly, buggy, incomplete product\nfeels like an unacceptable\ncompromise. How many of us were\nraised with the expectation that we\nwould put our best work forward? As\none manager put it to me recently, “I\nknow for me, the MVP feels a little\ndangerous—in a good way—since I\nhave always been such a\nperfectionist.”\nMinimum viable products range in\ncomplexity from extremely simple\nsmoke tests (little more than an\nadvertisement) to actual early\nprototypes complete with problems\nand missing features. Deciding\nexactly how complex an MVP needs\nto be cannot be done formulaically. It\nrequires judgment. Luckily, this\njudgment is not difficult to develop:\nmost entrepreneurs and product\ndevelopment people dramatically\noverestimate how many features are\nneeded in an MVP. When in doubt,\nsimplify.\nFor example, consider a service\nsold with a one-month free trial.\nBefore a customer can use the\nservice, he or she has to sign up for\nthe trial. One obvious assumption,\nthen, of the business model is that\ncustomers will sign up for a free trial\nonce they have a certain amount of\ninformation about the service. A\ncritical question to consider is\nwhether customers will in fact sign\nup for the free trial given a certain\nnumber of promised features (the\nvalue hypothesis).\nSomewhere in the business model,\nprobably buried in a single cell in a\nspreadsheet, it specifies the\n“percentage of customers who see\nthe free trial offer who then sign up.”\nMaybe in our projections we say that\nthis number should be 10 percent. If\nyou think about it, this is a leap-offaith question. It really should be\nrepresented in giant letters in a bold\nred font: WE ASSUME 10\nPERCENT OF CUSTOMERS WILL\nSIGN UP.\nMost entrepreneurs approach a\nquestion like this by building the\nproduct and then checking to see\nhow customers react to it. I consider\nthis to be exactly backward because\nit can lead to a lot of waste. First, if it\nturns out that we’re building\nsomething nobody wants, the whole\nexercise will be an avoidable\nexpense of time and money. If\ncustomers won’t sign up for the free\ntrial, they’ll never get to experience\nthe amazing features that await them.\nEven if they do sign up, there are\nmany other opportunities for waste.\nFor example, how many features do\nwe really need to include to appeal to\nearly adopters? Every extra feature is\na form of waste, and if we delay the\ntest for these extra features, it comes\nwith a tremendous potential cost in\nterms of learning and cycle time.\nThe lesson of the MVP is that any\nadditional work beyond what was\nrequired to start learning is waste, no\nmatter how important it might have\nseemed at the time.\nTo demonstrate, I’ll share several\nMVP techniques from actual Lean\nStartups. In each case, you’ll witness\nentrepreneurs avoiding the\ntemptation to overbuild and\noverpromise.\nTHE VIDEO MINIMUM\nVIABLE PRODUCT\nDrew Houston is the CEO of\nDropbox, a Silicon Valley company\nthat makes an extremely easy-to-use\nfile-sharing tool. Install its\napplication, and a Dropbox folder\nappears on your computer desktop.\nAnything you drag into that folder is\nuploaded automatically to the\nDropbox service and then instantly\nreplicated across all your computers\nand devices.\nThe founding team was made up\nof engineers, as the product\ndemanded significant technical\nexpertise to build. It required, for\nexample, integration with a variety\nof computer platforms and operating\nsystems: Windows, Macintosh,\niPhone, Android, and so on. Each of\nthese implementations happens at a\ndeep level of the system and requires\nspecialized know-how to make the\nuser experience exceptional. In fact,\none of Dropbox’s biggest\ncompetitive advantages is that the\nproduct works in such a seamless\nway that the competition struggles to\nemulate it.\nThese are not the kind of people\none would think of as marketing\ngeniuses. In fact, none of them had\never worked in a marketing job.\nThey had prominent venture capital\nbackers and could have been\nexpected to apply the standard\nengineering thinking to building the\nbusiness: build it and they will come.\nBut Dropbox did something\ndifferent.\nIn parallel with their product\ndevelopment efforts, the founders\nwanted feedback from customers\nabout what really mattered to them.\nIn particular, Dropbox needed to test\nits leap-of-faith question: if we can\nprovide a superior customer\nexperience, will people give our\nproduct a try? They believed—\nrightly, as it turned out—that file\nsynchronization was a problem that\nmost people didn’t know they had.\nOnce you experience the solution,\nyou can’t imagine how you ever\nlived without it.\nThis is not the kind of\nentrepreneurial question you can ask\nor expect an answer to in a focus\ngroup. Customers often don’t know\nwhat they want, and they often had a\nhard time understanding Dropbox\nwhen the concept was explained.\nHouston learned this the hard way\nwhen he tried to raise venture\ncapital. In meeting after meeting,\ninvestors would explain that this\n“market space” was crowded with\nexisting products, none of them had\nmade very much money, and the\nproblem wasn’t a very important\none. Drew would ask: “Have you\npersonally tried those other\nproducts?” When they would say\nyes, he’d ask: “Did they work\nseamlessly for you?” The answer\nwas almost always no. Yet in\nmeeting after meeting, the venture\ncapitalists could not imagine a world\nin line with Drew’s vision. Drew, in\ncontrast, believed that if the software\n“just worked like magic,” customers\nwould flock to it.\nThe challenge was that it was\nimpossible to demonstrate the\nworking software in a prototype\nform. The product required that they\novercome significant technical\nhurdles; it also had an online service\ncomponent that required high\nreliability and availability. To avoid\nthe risk of waking up after years of\ndevelopment with a product nobody\nwanted, Drew did something\nunexpectedly easy: he made a video.\nThe video is banal, a simple threeminute demonstration of the\ntechnology as it is meant to work,\nbut it was targeted at a community of\ntechnology early adopters. Drew\nnarrates the video personally, and as\nhe’s narrating, the viewer is\nwatching his screen. As he describes\nthe kinds of files he’d like to\nsynchronize, the viewer can watch\nhis mouse manipulate his computer.\nOf course, if you’re paying attention,\nyou start to notice that the files he’s\nmoving around are full of in-jokes\nand humorous references that were\nappreciated by this community of\nearly adopters. Drew recounted, “It\ndrove hundreds of thousands of\npeople to the website. Our beta\nwaiting list went from 5,000 people\nto 75,000 people literally overnight.\nIt totally blew us away.” Today,\nDropbox is one of Silicon Valley’s\nhottest companies, rumored to be\nworth more than $1 billion.5\nIn this case, the video was the\nminimum viable product. The MVP\nvalidated Drew’s leap-of-faith\nassumption that customers wanted\nthe product he was developing not\nbecause they said so in a focus group\nor because of a hopeful analogy to\nanother business, but because they\nactually signed up.\nTHE CONCIERGE MINIMUM\nVIABLE PRODUCT\nConsider another kind of MVP\ntechnique: the concierge MVP. To\nunderstand how this technique\nworks, meet Manuel Rosso, the CEO\nof an Austin, Texas–based startup\ncalled Food on the Table. Food on\nthe Table creates weekly meal plans\nand grocery lists that are based on\nfood you and your family enjoy, then\nhooks into your local grocery stores\nto find the best deals on the\ningredients.\nAfter you sign up for the site, you\nwalk through a little setup in which\nyou identify your main grocery store\nand check off the foods your family\nlikes. Later, you can pick another\nnearby store if you want to compare\nprices. Next, you’re presented with a\nlist of items that are based on your\npreferences and asked: “What are\nyou in the mood for this week?”\nMake your choices, select the\nnumber of meals you’re ready to\nplan, and choose what you care\nabout most in terms of time, money,\nhealth, or variety. At this point, the\nsite searches through recipes that\nmatch your needs, prices out the cost\nof the meal for you, and lets you\nprint out your shopping list.6\nClearly, this is an elaborate\nservice. Behind the scenes, a team of\nprofessional chefs devise recipes that\ntake advantage of items that are on\nsale at local grocery stores around\nthe country. Those recipes are\nmatched via computer algorithm to\neach family’s unique needs and\npreferences. Try to visualize the\nwork involved: databases of almost\nevery grocery store in the country\nmust be maintained, including\nwhat’s on sale at each one this week.\nThose groceries have to be matched\nto appropriate recipes and then\nappropriately customized, tagged,\nand sorted. If a recipe calls for\nbroccoli rabe, is that the same\ningredient as the broccoli on sale at\nthe local market?\nAfter reading that description, you\nmight be surprised to learn that Food\non the Table (FotT) began life with a\nsingle customer. Instead of\nsupporting thousands of grocery\nstores around the country as it does\ntoday, FotT supported just one. How\ndid the company choose which store\nto support? The founders didn’t—\nuntil they had their first customer.\nSimilarly, they began life with no\nrecipes whatsoever—until their first\ncustomer was ready to begin her\nmeal planning. In fact, the company\nserved its first customer without\nbuilding any software, without\nsigning any business development\npartnerships, and without hiring any\nchefs.\nManuel, along with VP of product\nSteve Sanderson, went to local\nsupermarkets and moms’ groups in\nhis hometown of Austin. Part of their\nmission was the typical observation\nof customers that is a part of design\nthinking and other ideation\ntechniques. However, Manuel and\nhis team were also on the hunt for\nsomething else: their first customer.\nAs they met potential customers in\nthose settings, they would interview\nthem the way any good market\nresearcher would, but at the end of\neach interview they would attempt to\nmake a sale. They’d describe the\nbenefits of FotT, name a weekly\nsubscription fee, and invite the\ncustomer to sign up. Most times they\nwere rejected. After all, most people\nare not early adopters and will not\nsign up for a new service sight\nunseen. But eventually someone did.\nThat one early adopter got the\nconcierge treatment. Instead of\ninteracting with the FotT product via\nimpersonal software, she got a\npersonal visit each week from the\nCEO of the company. He and the VP\nof product would review what was\non sale at her preferred grocery store\nand carefully select recipes on the\nbasis of her preferences, going so far\nas to learn her favorite recipes for\nitems she regularly cooked for her\nfamily. Each week they would hand\nher—in person—a prepared packet\ncontaining a shopping list and\nrelevant recipes, solicit her feedback,\nand make changes as necessary.\nMost important, each week they\nwould collect a check for $9.95.\nTalk about inefficient! Measured\naccording to traditional criteria, this\nis a terrible system, entirely\nnonscalable and a complete waste of\ntime. The CEO and VP of product,\ninstead of building their business, are\nengaged in the drudgery of solving\njust one customer’s problem. Instead\nof marketing themselves to millions,\nthey sold themselves to one. Worst\nof all, their efforts didn’t appear to be\nleading to anything tangible. They\nhad no product, no meaningful\nrevenue, no databases of recipes, not\neven a lasting organization.\nHowever, viewed through the lens\nof the Lean Startup, they were\nmaking monumental progress. Each\nweek they were learning more and\nmore about what was required to\nmake their product a success. After a\nfew weeks they were ready for\nanother customer. Each customer\nthey brought on made it easier to get\nthe next one, because FotT could\nfocus on the same grocery store,\ngetting to know its products and the\nkinds of people who shopped there\nwell. Each new customer got the\nconcierge treatment: personal inhome visits, the works. But after a\nfew more customers, the overhead of\nserving them one-on-one started to\nincrease.\nOnly at the point where the\nfounders were too busy to bring on\nadditional customers did Manuel and\nhis team start to invest in automation\nin the form of product development.\nEach iteration of their minimum\nviable product allowed them to save\na little more time and serve a few\nmore customers: delivering the\nrecipes and shopping list via e-mail\ninstead of via an in-home visit,\nstarting to parse lists of what was on\nsale automatically via software\ninstead of by hand, even eventually\ntaking credit card payments online\ninstead of a handwritten check.\nBefore long, they had built a\nsubstantial service offering, first in\nthe Austin area and eventually\nnationwide. But along the way, their\nproduct development team was\nalways focused on scaling something\nthat was working rather than trying\nto invent something that might work\nin the future. As a result, their\ndevelopment efforts involved far less\nwaste than is typical for a venture of\nthis kind.\nIt is important to contrast this with\nthe case of a small business, in\nwhich it is routine to see the CEO,\nfounder, president, and owner\nserving customers directly, one at a\ntime. In a concierge MVP, this\npersonalized service is not the\nproduct but a learning activity\ndesigned to test the leap-of-faith\nassumptions in the company’s\ngrowth model. In fact, a common\noutcome of a concierge MVP is to\ninvalidate the company’s proposed\ngrowth model, making it clear that a\ndifferent approach is needed. This\ncan happen even if the initial MVP is\nprofitable for the company. Without\na formal growth model, many\ncompanies get caught in the trap of\nbeing satisfied with a small\nprofitable business when a pivot\n(change in course or strategy) might\nlead to more significant growth. The\nonly way to know is to have tested\nthe growth model systematically\nwith real customers.\nPAY NO ATTENTION TO THE\nEIGHT PEOPLE BEHIND THE\nCURTAIN\nMeet Max Ventilla and Damon\nHorowitz, technologists with a vision\nto build a new type of search\nsoftware designed to answer the\nkinds of questions that befuddle\nstate-of-the-art companies such as\nGoogle. Google befuddled? Think\nabout it. Google and its peers excel\nat answering factual questions: What\nis the tallest mountain in the world?\nWho was the twenty-third president\nof the United States? But for more\nsubjective questions, Google\nstruggles. Ask, “What’s a good place\nto go out for a drink after the ball\ngame in my city?” and the\ntechnology flails. What’s interesting\nabout this class of queries is that they\nare relatively easy for a person to\nanswer. Imagine being at a cocktail\nparty surrounded by friends. How\nlikely would you be to get a highquality answer to your subjective\nquestion? You almost certainly\nwould get one. Unlike factual\nqueries, because these subjective\nquestions have no single right\nanswer, today’s technology struggles\nto answer them. Such questions\ndepend on the person answering\nthem, his or her personal experience,\ntaste, and assessment of what you’re\nlooking for.\nTo solve this problem, Max and\nDamon created a product called\nAardvark. With their deep technical\nknowledge and industry experience,\nit would have been reasonable to\nexpect them to dive in and start\nprogramming. Instead, they took six\nmonths to figure out what they\nshould be building. But they didn’t\nspend that year at the whiteboard\nstrategizing or engage in a lengthy\nmarket research project.\nInstead, they built a series of\nfunctioning products, each designed\nto test a way of solving this problem\nfor their customers. Each product\nwas then offered to beta testers,\nwhose behavior was used to validate\nor refute each specific hypothesis\n(see examples in sidebar).\nThe following list of projects are\nexamples from Aardvark’s ideation\nperiod.7\nRekkit. A service to collect your\nratings from across the web and give\nbetter recommendations to you.\nNinjapa. A way that you could open\naccounts in various applications\nthrough a single website and manage\nyour data across multiple sites.\nThe Webb. A central number that\nyou could call and talk to a person\nwho could do anything for you that\nyou could do online.\nWeb Macros. A way to record\nsequences of steps on websites so\nthat you could repeat common\nactions, even across sites, and share\n“recipes” for how you accomplished\nonline tasks.\nInternet Button Company. A way\nto package steps taken on a website\nand smart form-fill functionality.\nPeople could encode buttons and\nshare buttons à la social\nbookmarking.\nMax and Damon had a vision that\ncomputers could be used to create a\nvirtual personal assistant to which\ntheir customers could ask questions.\nBecause the assistant was designed\nfor subjective questions, the answers\nrequired human judgment. Thus, the\nearly Aardvark experiments tried\nmany variations on this theme,\nbuilding a series of prototypes for\nways customers could interact with\nthe virtual assistant and get their\nquestions answered. All the early\nprototypes failed to engage the\ncustomers.\nAs Max describes it, “We selffunded the company and released\nvery cheap prototypes to test. What\nbecame Aardvark was the sixth\nprototype. Each prototype was a twoto four-week effort. We used humans\nto replicate the back end as much as\npossible. We invited one hundred to\ntwo hundred friends to try the\nprototypes and measured how many\nof them came back. The results were\nunambiguously negative until\nAardvark.”\nBecause of the short time line,\nnone of the prototypes involved\nadvanced technology. Instead, they\nwere MVPs designed to test a more\nimportant question: what would be\nrequired to get customers to engage\nwith the product and tell their friends\nabout it?\n“Once we chose Aardvark,”\nVentilla says, “we continued to run\nwith humans replicating pieces of the\nbackend for nine months. We hired\neight people to manage queries,\nclassify conversations, etc. We\nactually raised our seed and series A\nrounds before the system was\nautomated—the assumption was that\nthe lines between humans and\nartificial intelligence would cross,\nand we at least proved that we were\nbuilding stuff people would respond\nto.\n“As we refined the product, we\nwould bring in six to twelve people\nweekly to react to mockups,\nprototypes, or simulations that we\nwere working on. It was a mix of\nexisting users and people who never\nsaw the product before. We had our\nengineers join for many of these\nsessions, both so that they could\nmake modifications in real time, but\nalso so we could all experience the\npain of a user not knowing what to\ndo.”8\nThe Aardvark product they settled\non worked via instant messaging\n(IM). Customers could send\nAardvark a question via IM, and\nAardvark would get them an answer\nthat was drawn from the customer’s\nsocial network: the system would\nseek out the customer’s friends and\nfriends of friends and pose the\nquestion to them. Once it got a\nsuitable answer, it would report back\nto the initial customer.\nOf course, a product like that\nrequires a very important algorithm:\ngiven a question about a certain\ntopic, who is the best person in the\ncustomer’s social network to answer\nthat question? For example, a\nquestion about restaurants in San\nFrancisco shouldn’t be routed to\nsomeone in Seattle. More\nchallenging still, a question about\ncomputer programming probably\nshouldn’t be routed to an art student.\nThroughout their testing process,\nMax and Damon encountered many\ndifficult technological problems like\nthese. Each time, they emphatically\nrefused to solve them at that early\nstage. Instead, they used Wizard of\nOz testing to fake it. In a Wizard of\nOz test, customers believe they are\ninteracting with the actual product,\nbut behind the scenes human beings\nare doing the work. Like the\nconcierge MVP, this approach is\nincredibly inefficient. Imagine a\nservice that allowed customers to ask\nquestions of human researchers—for\nfree—and expect a real-time\nresponse. Such a service (at scale)\nwould lose money, but it is easy to\nbuild on a micro scale. At that scale,\nit allowed Max and Damon to\nanswer these all-important questions:\nIf we can solve the tough technical\nproblems behind this artificial\nintelligence product, will people use\nit? Will their use lead to the creation\nof a product that has real value?\nIt was this system that allowed\nMax and Damon to pivot over and\nover again, rejecting concepts that\nseemed promising but that would not\nhave been viable. When they were\nready to start scaling, they had a\nready-made road map of what to\nbuild. The result: Aardvark was\nacquired for a reported $50 million—\nby Google.9\nTHE ROLE OF QUALITY AND\nDESIGN IN AN MVP\nOne of the most vexing aspects of\nthe minimum viable product is the\nchallenge it poses to traditional\nnotions of quality. The best\nprofessionals and craftspersons alike\naspire to build quality products; it is\na point of pride.\nModern production processes rely\non high quality as a way to boost\nefficiency. They operate using W.\nEdwards Deming’s famous dictum\nthat the customer is the most\nimportant part of the production\nprocess. This means that we must\nfocus our energies exclusively on\nproducing outcomes that the\ncustomer perceives as valuable.\nAllowing sloppy work into our\nprocess inevitably leads to excessive\nvariation. Variation in process yields\nproducts of varying quality in the\neyes of the customer that at best\nrequire rework and at worst lead to a\nlost customer. Most modern business\nand engineering philosophies focus\non producing high-quality\nexperiences for customers as a\nprimary principle; it is the foundation\nof Six Sigma, lean manufacturing,\ndesign thinking, extreme\nprogramming, and the software\ncraftsmanship movement.\nThese discussions of quality\npresuppose that the company already\nknows what attributes of the product\nthe customer will perceive as\nworthwhile. In a startup, this is a\nrisky assumption to make. Often we\nare not even sure who the customer\nis. Thus, for startups, I believe in the\nfollowing quality principle:\nIf we do not know who the\ncustomer is, we do not know\nwhat quality is.\nEven a “low-quality” MVP can act\nin service of building a great highquality product. Yes, MVPs\nsometimes are perceived as lowquality by customers. If so, we\nshould use this as an opportunity to\nlearn what attributes customers care\nabout. This is infinitely better than\nmere speculation or whiteboard\nstrategizing, because it provides a\nsolid empirical foundation on which\nto build future products.\nSometimes, however, customers\nreact quite differently. Many famous\nproducts were released in a “lowquality” state, and customers loved\nthem. Imagine if Craig Newmark, in\nthe early days of Craigslist, had\nrefused to publish his humble e-mail\nnewsletter because it lacked\nsufficient high design. What if the\nfounders of Groupon had felt “two\npizzas for the price of one” was\nbeneath them?\nI have had many similar\nexperiences. In the early days of\nIMVU, our avatars were locked in\none place, unable to move around the\nscreen. The reason? We were\nbuilding an MVP and had not yet\ntackled the difficult task of creating\nthe technology that would allow\navatars to walk around the virtual\nenvironments they inhabit. In the\nvideo game industry, the standard is\nthat 3D avatars should move fluidly\nas they walk, avoid obstacles in their\npath, and take an intelligent route\ntoward their destination. Famous\nbest-selling games such as Electronic\nA r t s ’ The Sims work on this\nprinciple. We didn’t want to ship a\nlow-quality version of this feature, so\nwe opted instead to ship with\nstationary avatars.\nFeedback from the customers was\nvery consistent: they wanted the\nability to move their avatars around\nthe environment. We took this as bad\nnews because it meant we would\nhave to spend considerable amounts\nof time and money on a high-quality\nsolution similar to The Sims. But\nbefore we committed ourselves to\nthat path, we decided to try another\nMVP. We used a simple hack, which\nfelt almost like cheating. We\nchanged the product so that\ncustomers could click where they\nwanted their avatar to go, and the\navatar would teleport there instantly.\nNo walking, no obstacle avoidance.\nThe avatar disappeared and then\nreappeared an instant later in the new\nplace. We couldn’t even afford fancy\nteleportation graphics or sound\neffects. We felt lame shipping this\nfeature, but it was all we could\nafford.\nYou can imagine our surprise\nwhen we started to get positive\ncustomer feedback. We never asked\nabout the movement feature directly\n(we were too embarrassed). But\nwhen asked to name the top things\nabout IMVU they liked best,\ncustomers consistently listed avatar\n“teleportation” among the top three\n(unbelievably, they often specifically\ndescribed it as “more advanced than\nThe Sims”). This inexpensive\ncompromise outperformed many\nfeatures of the product we were most\nproud of, features that had taken\nmuch more time and money to\nproduce.\nCustomers don’t care how much\ntime something takes to build. They\ncare only if it serves their needs. Our\ncustomers preferred the quick\nteleportation feature because it\nallowed them to get where they\nwanted to go as fast as possible. In\nretrospect, this makes sense.\nWouldn’t we all like to get wherever\nwe’re going in an instant? No lines,\nno hours on a plane or sitting on the\ntarmac, no connections, no cabs or\nsubways. Beam me up, Scotty. Our\nexpensive “real-world” approach\nwas beaten handily by a cool\nfantasy-world feature that cost much\nless but that our customers preferred.\nSo which version of the product is\nlow-quality, again?\nMVPs require the courage to put\none’s assumptions to the test. If\ncustomers react the way we expect,\nwe can take that as confirmation that\nour assumptions are correct. If we\nrelease a poorly designed product\nand customers (even early adopters)\ncannot figure out how to use it, that\nwill confirm our need to invest in\nsuperior design. But we must always\nask: what if they don’t care about\ndesign in the same way we do?\nThus, the Lean Startup method is\nnot opposed to building high-quality\nproducts, but only in service of the\ngoal of winning over customers. We\nmust be willing to set aside our\ntraditional professional standards to\nstart the process of validated learning\nas soon as possible. But once again,\nthis does not mean operating in a\nsloppy or undisciplined way. (This is\nan important caveat. There is a\ncategory of quality problems that\nhave the net effect of slowing down\nthe Build-Measure-Learn feedback\nloop. Defects make it more difficult\nto evolve the product. They actually\ninterfere with our ability to learn and\nso are dangerous to tolerate in any\nproduction process. We will consider\nmethods for figuring out when to\nmake investments in preventing\nthese kinds of problems in Part\nThree.)\nAs you consider building your\nown minimum viable product, let\nthis simple rule suffice: remove any\nfeature, process, or effort that does\nnot contribute directly to the learning\nyou seek.\nSPEED BUMPS IN BUILDING\nAN MVP\nBuilding an MVP is not without\nrisks, both real and imagined. Both\ncan derail a startup effort unless they\nare understood ahead of time. The\nmost common speed bumps are legal\nissues, fears about competitors,\nbranding risks, and the impact on\nmorale.\nFor startups that rely on patent\nprotection, there are special\nchallenges with releasing an early\nproduct. In some jurisdictions, the\nwindow for filing a patent begins\nwhen the product is released to the\ngeneral public, and depending on the\nway the MVP is structured, releasing\nit may start this clock. Even if your\nstartup is not in one of those\njurisdictions, you may want\ninternational patent protection and\nmay wind up having to abide by\nthese more stringent requirements.\n(In my opinion, issues like this are\none of the many ways in which\ncurrent patent law inhibits innovation\nand should be remedied as a matter\nof public policy.)\nIn many industries, patents are\nused primarily for defensive\npurposes, as a deterrent to hold\ncompetitors at bay. In such cases, the\npatent risks of an MVP are minor\ncompared with the learning benefits.\nHowever, in industries in which a\nnew scientific breakthrough is at the\nheart of a company’s competitive\nadvantage, these risks need to be\nbalanced more carefully. In all cases,\nentrepreneurs should seek legal\ncounsel to ensure that they\nunderstand the risks fully.\nLegal risks may be daunting, but\nyou may be surprised to learn that\nthe most common objection I have\nheard over the years to building an\nMVP is fear of competitors—\nespecially large established\ncompanies—stealing a startup’s\nideas. If only it were so easy to have\na good idea stolen! Part of the\nspecial challenge of being a startup\nis the near impossibility of having\nyour idea, company, or product be\nnoticed by anyone, let alone a\ncompetitor. In fact, I have often\ngiven entrepreneurs fearful of this\nissue the following assignment: take\none of your ideas (one of your lesser\ninsights, perhaps), find the name of\nthe relevant product manager at an\nestablished company who has\nresponsibility for that area, and try to\nget that company to steal your idea.\nCall them up, write them a memo,\nsend them a press release—go ahead,\ntry it. The truth is that most\nmanagers in most companies are\nalready overwhelmed with good\nideas. Their challenge lies in\nprioritization and execution, and it is\nthose challenges that give a startup\nhope of surviving.10\nIf a competitor can outexecute a\nstartup once the idea is known, the\nstartup is doomed anyway. The\nreason to build a new team to pursue\nan idea is that you believe you can\naccelerate through the BuildMeasure-Learn feedback loop faster\nthan anyone else can. If that’s true, it\nmakes no difference what the\ncompetition knows. If it’s not true, a\nstartup has much bigger problems,\nand secrecy won’t fix them. Sooner\nor later, a successful startup will face\ncompetition from fast followers. A\nhead start is rarely large enough to\nmatter, and time spent in stealth\nmode—away from customers—is\nunlikely to provide a head start. The\nonly way to win is to learn faster\nthan anyone else.\nMany startups plan to invest in\nbuilding a great brand, and an MVP\ncan seem like a dangerous branding\nrisk. Similarly, entrepreneurs in\nexisting organizations often are\nconstrained by the fear of damaging\nthe parent company’s established\nbrand. In either of these cases, there\nis an easy solution: launch the MVP\nunder a different brand name. In\naddition, a long-term reputation is\nonly at risk when companies engage\nin vocal launch activities such as PR\nand building hype. When a product\nfails to live up to those\npronouncements, real long-term\ndamage can happen to a corporate\nbrand. But startups have the\nadvantage of being obscure, having a\npathetically small number of\ncustomers, and not having much\nexposure. Rather than lamenting\nthem, use these advantages to\nexperiment under the radar and then\ndo a public marketing launch once\nthe product has proved itself with\nreal customers.11\nFinally, it helps to prepare for the\nfact that MVPs often result in bad\nnews. Unlike traditional concept\ntests or prototypes, they are designed\nto speak to the full range of business\nquestions, not just design or\ntechnical ones, and they often\nprovide a needed dose of reality. In\nfact, piercing the reality distortion\nfield is quite uncomfortable.\nVisionaries are especially afraid of a\nfalse negative: that customers will\nreject a flawed MVP that is too small\nor too limited. It is precisely this\nattitude that one sees when\ncompanies launch fully formed\nproducts without prior testing. They\nsimply couldn’t bear to test them in\nanything less than their full splendor.\nYet there is wisdom in the\nvisionary’s fear. Teams steeped in\ntraditional product development\nmethods are trained to make go/kill\ndecisions on a regular basis. That is\nthe essence of the waterfall or stagegate development model. If an MVP\nfails, teams are liable to give up hope\nand abandon the project altogether.\nBut this is a solvable problem.\nFROM THE MVP TO\nINNOVATION ACCOUNTING\nThe solution to this dilemma is a\ncommitment to iteration. You have\nto commit to a locked-in agreement\n—ahead of time—that no matter\nwhat comes of testing the MVP, you\nwill not give up hope. Successful\nentrepreneurs do not give up at the\nfirst sign of trouble, nor do they\npersevere the plane right into the\nground. Instead, they possess a\nunique combination of perseverance\nand flexibility. The MVP is just the\nfirst step on a journey of learning.\nDown that road—after many\niterations—you may learn that some\nelement of your product or strategy\nis flawed and decide it is time to\nmake a change, which I call a pivot,\nto a different method for achieving\nyour vision.\nStartups are especially at risk\nwhen outside stakeholders and\ninvestors (especially corporate CFOs\nfor internal projects) have a crisis of\nconfidence. When the project was\nauthorized or the investment made,\nthe entrepreneur promised that the\nnew product would be world-\nchanging. Customers were supposed\nto flock to it in record numbers. Why\nare so few actually doing so?\nIn traditional management, a\nmanager who promises to deliver\nsomething and fails to do so is in\ntrouble. There are only two possible\nexplanations: a failure of execution\nor a failure to plan appropriately.\nBoth are equally inexcusable.\nEntrepreneurial managers face a\ndifficult problem: because the plans\nand projections we make are full of\nuncertainty, how can we claim\nsuccess when we inevitably fail to\ndeliver what we promised? Put\nanother way, how does the CFO or\nVC know that we’re failing because\nwe learned something critical and\nnot because we were goofing off or\nmisguided?\nThe solution to this problem\nresides at the heart of the Lean\nStartup model. We all need a\ndisciplined, systematic approach to\nfiguring out if we’re making progress\nand discovering if we’re actually\nachieving validated learning. I call\nthis system innovation accounting,\nan alternative to traditional\naccounting designed specifically for\nstartups. It is the subject of Chapter\n7.\n7\nMEASURE\nAt the beginning, a startup is little\nmore than a model on a piece of\npaper. The financials in the business\nplan include projections of how\nmany customers the company\nexpects to attract, how much it will\nspend, and how much revenue and\nprofit that will lead to. It’s an ideal\nthat’s usually far from where the\nstartup is in its early days.\nA startup’s job is to (1) rigorously\nmeasure where it is right now,\nconfronting the hard truths that\nassessment reveals, and then (2)\ndevise experiments to learn how to\nmove the real numbers closer to the\nideal reflected in the business plan.\nMost products—even the ones that\nfail—do not have zero traction. Most\nproducts have some customers, some\ngrowth, and some positive results.\nOne of the most dangerous outcomes\nfor a startup is to bumble along in the\nland of the living dead. Employees\nand entrepreneurs tend to be\noptimistic by nature. We want to\nkeep believing in our ideas even\nwhen the writing is on the wall. This\nis why the myth of perseverance is\nso dangerous. We all know stories of\nepic entrepreneurs who managed to\npull out a victory when things\nseemed incredibly bleak.\nUnfortunately, we don’t hear stories\nabout the countless nameless others\nwho persevered too long, leading\ntheir companies to failure.\nWHY SOMETHING AS\nSEEMINGLY DULL AS\nACCOUNTING WILL CHANGE\nYOUR LIFE\nPeople are accustomed to thinking of\naccounting as dry and boring, a\nnecessary evil used primarily to\nprepare financial reports and survive\naudits, but that is because accounting\nis something that has become taken\nfor granted. Historically, under the\nleadership of people such as Alfred\nSloan at General Motors, accounting\nbecame an essential part of the\nmethod of exerting centralized\ncontrol over far-flung divisions.\nAccounting allowed GM to set clear\nmilestones for each of its divisions\nand then hold each manager\naccountable for his or her division’s\nsuccess in reaching those goals. All\nmodern corporations use some\nvariation of that approach.\nAccounting is the key to their\nsuccess.\nUnfortunately, standard\naccounting is not helpful in\nevaluating entrepreneurs. Startups\nare too unpredictable for forecasts\nand milestones to be accurate.\nI recently met with a phenomenal\nstartup team. They are well financed,\nhave significant customer traction,\nand are growing rapidly. Their\nproduct is a leader in an emerging\ncategory of enterprise software that\nuses consumer marketing techniques\nto sell into large companies. For\nexample, they rely on employee-toemployee viral adoption rather than a\ntraditional sales process, which\nmight target the chief information\nofficer or the head of information\ntechnology (IT). As a result, they\nhave the opportunity to use cuttingedge experimental techniques as they\nconstantly revise their product.\nDuring the meeting, I asked the team\na simple question that I make a habit\nof asking startups whenever we\nmeet: are you making your product\nbetter? They always say yes. Then I\nask: how do you know? I invariably\nget this answer: well, we are in\nengineering and we made a number\nof changes last month, and our\ncustomers seem to like them, and our\noverall numbers are higher this\nmonth. We must be on the right\ntrack.\nThis is the kind of storytelling that\ntakes place at most startup board\nmeetings. Most milestones are built\nthe same way: hit a certain product\nmilestone, maybe talk to a few\ncustomers, and see if the numbers go\nup. Unfortunately, this is not a good\nindicator of whether a startup is\nmaking progress. How do we know\nthat the changes we’ve made are\nrelated to the results we’re seeing?\nMore important, how do we know\nthat we are drawing the right lessons\nfrom those changes?\nTo answer these kinds of\nquestions, startups have a strong\nneed for a new kind of accounting\ngeared specifically to disruptive\ninnovation. That’s what innovation\naccounting is.\nAn Accountability Framework\nThat Works Across Industries\nInnovation accounting enables\nstartups to prove objectively that\nthey are learning how to grow a\nsustainable business. Innovation\naccounting begins by turning the\nleap-of-faith assumptions discussed\ni n Chapter 5 into a quantitative\nfinancial model. Every business plan\nhas some kind of model associated\nwith it, even if it’s written on the\nback of a napkin. That model\nprovides assumptions about what the\nbusiness will look like at a\nsuccessful point in the future.\nFor example, the business plan for\nan established manufacturing\ncompany would show it growing in\nproportion to its sales volume. As the\nprofits from the sales of goods are\nreinvested in marketing and\npromotions, the company gains new\ncustomers. The rate of growth\ndepends primarily on three things:\nthe profitability of each customer,\nthe cost of acquiring new customers,\nand the repeat purchase rate of\nexisting customers. The higher these\nvalues are, the faster the company\nwill grow and the more profitable it\nwill be. These are the drivers of the\ncompany’s growth model.\nBy contrast, a marketplace\ncompany that matches buyers and\nsellers such as eBay will have a\ndifferent growth model. Its success\ndepends primarily on the network\neffects that make it the premier\ndestination for both buyers and\nsellers to transact business. Sellers\nwant the marketplace with the\nhighest number of potential\ncustomers. Buyers want the\nmarketplace with the most\ncompetition among sellers, which\nleads to the greatest availability of\nproducts and the lowest prices. (In\neconomics, this sometimes is called\nsupply-side increasing returns and\ndemand-side increasing returns.) For\nthis kind of startup, the important\nthing to measure is that the network\neffects are working, as evidenced by\nthe high retention rate of new buyers\nand sellers. If people stick with the\nproduct with very little attrition, the\nmarketplace will grow no matter how\nthe company acquires new\ncustomers. The growth curve will\nlook like a compounding interest\ntable, with the rate of growth\ndepending on the “interest rate” of\nnew customers coming to the\nproduct.\nThough these two businesses have\nvery different drivers of growth, we\ncan still use a common framework to\nhold their leaders accountable. This\nframework supports accountability\neven when the model changes.\nHOW INNOVATION\nACCOUNTING WORKS—\nTHREE LEARNING\nMILESTONES\nInnovation accounting works in three\nsteps: first, use a minimum viable\nproduct to establish real data on\nwhere the company is right now.\nWithout a clear-eyed picture of your\ncurrent status—no matter how far\nfrom the goal you may be—you\ncannot begin to track your progress.\nSecond, startups must attempt to\ntune the engine from the baseline\ntoward the ideal. This may take\nmany attempts. After the startup has\nmade all the micro changes and\nproduct optimizations it can to move\nits baseline toward the ideal, the\ncompany reaches a decision point.\nThat is the third step: pivot or\npersevere.\nIf the company is making good\nprogress toward the ideal, that means\nit’s learning appropriately and using\nthat learning effectively, in which\ncase it makes sense to continue. If\nnot, the management team eventually\nmust conclude that its current\nproduct strategy is flawed and needs\na serious change. When a company\npivots, it starts the process all over\nagain, reestablishing a new baseline\nand then tuning the engine from\nthere. The sign of a successful pivot\nis that these engine-tuning activities\nare more productive after the pivot\nthan before.\nEstablish the Baseline\nFor example, a startup might create a\ncomplete prototype of its product and\noffer to sell it to real customers\nthrough its main marketing channel.\nThis single MVP would test most of\nthe startup’s assumptions and\nestablish baseline metrics for each\nassumption simultaneously.\nAlternatively, a startup might prefer\nto build separate MVPs that are\naimed at getting feedback on one\nassumption at a time. Before\nbuilding the prototype, the company\nmight perform a smoke test with its\nmarketing materials. This is an old\ndirect marketing technique in which\ncustomers are given the opportunity\nto preorder a product that has not yet\nbeen built. A smoke test measures\nonly one thing: whether customers\nare interested in trying a product. By\nitself, this is insufficient to validate\nan entire growth model. Nonetheless,\nit can be very useful to get feedback\non this assumption before\ncommitting more money and other\nresources to the product.\nThese MVPs provide the first\nexample of a learning milestone. An\nMVP allows a startup to fill in real\nbaseline data in its growth model—\nconversion rates, sign-up and trial\nrates, customer lifetime value, and so\non—and this is valuable as the\nfoundation for learning about\ncustomers and their reactions to a\nproduct even if that foundation\nbegins with extremely bad news.\nWhen one is choosing among the\nmany assumptions in a business\nplan, it makes sense to test the\nriskiest assumptions first. If you\ncan’t find a way to mitigate these\nrisks toward the ideal that is required\nfor a sustainable business, there is no\npoint in testing the others. For\nexample, a media business that is\nselling advertising has two basic\nassumptions that take the form of\nquestions: Can it capture the\nattention of a defined customer\nsegment on an ongoing basis? and\ncan it sell that attention to\nadvertisers? In a business in which\nthe advertising rates for a particular\ncustomer segment are well known,\nthe far riskier assumption is the\nability to capture attention.\nTherefore, the first experiments\nshould involve content production\nrather than advertising sales. Perhaps\nthe company will produce a pilot\nepisode or issue to see how\ncustomers engage.\nTuning the Engine\nOnce the baseline has been\nestablished, the startup can work\ntoward the second learning\nmilestone: tuning the engine. Every\nproduct development, marketing, or\nother initiative that a startup\nundertakes should be targeted at\nimproving one of the drivers of its\ngrowth model. For example, a\ncompany might spend time\nimproving the design of its product\nto make it easier for new customers\nto use. This presupposes that the\nactivation rate of new customers is a\ndriver of growth and that its baseline\nis lower than the company would\nlike. To demonstrate validated\nlearning, the design changes must\nimprove the activation rate of new\ncustomers. If they do not, the new\ndesign should be judged a failure.\nThis is an important rule: a good\ndesign is one that changes customer\nbehavior for the better.\nCompare two startups. The first\ncompany sets out with a clear\nbaseline metric, a hypothesis about\nwhat will improve that metric, and a\nset of experiments designed to test\nthat hypothesis. The second team sits\naround debating what would improve\nthe product, implements several of\nthose changes at once, and celebrates\nif there is any positive increase in\nany of the numbers. Which startup is\nmore likely to be doing effective\nwork and achieving lasting results?\nPivot or Persevere\nOver time, a team that is learning its\nway toward a sustainable business\nwill see the numbers in its model rise\nfrom the horrible baseline\nestablished by the MVP and\nconverge to something like the ideal\none established in the business plan.\nA startup that fails to do so will see\nthat ideal recede ever farther into the\ndistance. When this is done right,\neven the most powerful reality\ndistortion field won’t be able to\ncover up this simple fact: if we’re not\nmoving the drivers of our business\nmodel, we’re not making progress.\nThat becomes a sure sign that it’s\ntime to pivot.\nINNOVATION ACCOUNTING\nAT IMVU\nHere’s what innovation accounting\nlooked like for us in the early days of\nIMVU. Our minimum viable product\nhad many defects and, when we first\nreleased it, extremely low sales. We\nnaturally assumed that the lack of\nsales was related to the low quality\nof the product, so week after week\nwe worked on improving the quality\nof the product, trusting that our\nefforts were worthwhile. At the end\nof each month, we would have a\nboard meeting at which we would\npresent the results. The night before\nthe board meeting, we’d run our\nstandard analytics, measuring\nconversion rates, customer counts,\nand revenue to show what a good job\nwe had done. For several meetings in\na row, this caused a last-minute\npanic because the quality\nimprovements were not yielding any\nchange in customer behavior. This\nled to some frustrating board\nmeetings at which we could show\ngreat product “progress” but not\nmuch in the way of business results.\nAfter a while, rather than leave it to\nthe last minute, we began to track\nour metrics more frequently,\ntightening the feedback loop with\nproduct development. This was even\nmore depressing. Week in, week out,\nour product changes were having no\neffect.\nImproving a Product on Five\nDollars a Day\nWe tracked the “funnel metrics”\nbehaviors that were critical to our\nengine of growth: customer\nregistration, the download of our\napplication, trial, repeat usage, and\npurchase. To have enough data to\nlearn, we needed just enough\ncustomers using our product to get\nreal numbers for each behavior. We\nallocated a budget of five dollars per\nday: enough to buy clicks on the\nthen-new Google AdWords system.\nIn those days, the minimum you\ncould bid for a click was 5 cents, but\nthere was no overall minimum to\nyour spending. Thus, we could afford\nto open an account and get started\neven though we had very little\nmoney.1\nFive dollars bought us a hundred\nclicks—every day. From a marketing\npoint of view this was not very\nsignificant, but for learning it was\npriceless. Every single day we were\nable to measure our product’s\nperformance with a brand new set of\ncustomers. Also, each time we\nrevised the product, we got a brand\nnew report card on how we were\ndoing the very next day.\nFor example, one day we would\ndebut a new marketing message\naimed at first-time customers. The\nnext day we might change the way\nnew customers were initiated into the\nproduct. Other days, we would add\nnew features, fix bugs, roll out a new\nvisual design, or try a new layout for\nour website. Every time, we told\nourselves we were making the\nproduct better, but that subjective\nconfidence was put to the acid test of\nreal numbers.\nDay in and day out we were\nperforming random trials. Each day\nwas a new experiment. Each day’s\ncustomers were independent of those\nof the day before. Most important,\neven though our gross numbers were\ngrowing, it became clear that our\nfunnel metrics were not changing.\nHere is a graph from one of\nIMVU’s early board meetings:\nThis graph represents\napproximately seven months of\nwork. Over that period, we were\nmaking constant improvements to\nthe IMVU product, releasing new\nfeatures on a daily basis. We were\nconducting a lot of in-person\ncustomer interviews, and our product\ndevelopment team was working\nextremely hard.\nCohort Analysis\nTo read the graph, you need to\nunderstand something called cohort\nanalysis. This is one of the most\nimportant tools of startup analytics.\nAlthough it sounds complex, it is\nbased on a simple premise. Instead\nof looking at cumulative totals or\ngross numbers such as total revenue\nand total number of customers, one\nlooks at the performance of each\ngroup of customers that comes into\ncontact with the product\nindependently. Each group is called a\ncohort. The graph shows the\nconversion rates to IMVU of new\ncustomers who joined in each\nindicated month. Each conversion\nrate shows the percentage of\ncustomer who registered in that\nmonth who subsequently went on to\ntake the indicated action. Thus,\namong all the customers who joined\nIMVU in February 2005, about 60\npercent of them logged in to our\nproduct at least one time.\nManagers with an enterprise sales\nbackground will recognize this\nfunnel analysis as the traditional\nsales funnel that is used to manage\nprospects on their way to becoming\ncustomers. Lean Startups use it in\nproduct development, too. This\ntechnique is useful in many types of\nbusiness, because every company\ndepends for its survival on sequences\nof customer behavior called flows.\nCustomer flows govern the\ninteraction of customers with a\ncompany’s products. They allow us\nto understand a business\nquantitatively and have much more\npredictive power than do traditional\ngross metrics.\nIf you look closely, you’ll see that\nthe graph shows some clear trends.\nSome product improvements are\nhelping—a little. The percentage of\nnew customers who go on to use the\nproduct at least five times has grown\nfrom less than 5 percent to almost 20\npercent. Yet despite this fourfold\nincrease, the percentage of new\ncustomers who pay money for\nIMVU is stuck at around 1 percent.\nThink about that for a moment. After\nmonths and months of work,\nthousands of individual\nimprovements, focus groups, design\nsessions, and usability tests, the\npercentage of new customers who\nsubsequently pay money is exactly\nthe same as it was at the onset even\nthough many more customers are\ngetting a chance to try the product.\nThanks to the power of cohort\nanalysis, we could not blame this\nfailure on the legacy of previous\ncustomers who were resistant to\nchange, external market conditions,\nor any other excuse. Each cohort\nrepresented an independent report\ncard, and try as we might, we were\ngetting straight C’s. This helped us\nrealize we had a problem.\nI was in charge of the product\ndevelopment team, small though it\nwas in those days, and shared with\nmy cofounders the sense that the\nproblem had to be with my team’s\nefforts. I worked harder, tried to\nfocus on higher- and higher-quality\nfeatures, and lost a lot of sleep. Our\nfrustration grew. When I could think\nof nothing else to do, I was finally\nready to turn to the last resort:\ntalking to customers. Armed with our\nfailure to make progress tuning our\nengine of growth, I was ready to ask\nthe right questions.\nBefore this failure, in the\ncompany’s earliest days, it was easy\nto talk to potential customers and\ncome away convinced we were on\nthe right track. In fact, when we\nwould invite customers into the\noffice for in-person interviews and\nusability tests, it was easy to dismiss\nnegative feedback. If they didn’t\nwant to use the product, I assumed\nthey were not in our target market.\n“Fire that customer,” I’d say to the\nperson responsible for recruiting for\nour tests. “Find me someone in our\ntarget demographic.” If the next\ncustomer was more positive, I would\ntake it as confirmation that I was\nright in my targeting. If not, I’d fire\nanother customer and try again.\nBy contrast, once I had data in\nhand, my interactions with customers\nchanged. Suddenly I had urgent\nquestions that needed answering:\nWhy aren’t customers responding to\nour product “improvements”? Why\nisn’t our hard work paying off? For\nexample, we kept making it easier\nand easier for customers to use\nIMVU with their existing friends.\nUnfortunately, customers didn’t want\nto engage in that behavior. Making it\neasier to use was totally beside the\npoint. Once we knew what to look\nfor, genuine understanding came\nmuch faster. As was described in\nChapter 3, this eventually led to a\ncritically important pivot: away from\nan IM add-on used with existing\nfriends and toward a stand-alone\nnetwork one can use to make new\nfriends. Suddenly, our worries about\nproductivity vanished. Once our\nefforts were aligned with what\ncustomers really wanted, our\nexperiments were much more likely\nto change their behavior for the\nbetter.\nThis pattern would repeat time and\nagain, from the days when we were\nmaking less than a thousand dollars\nin revenue per month all the way up\nto the time we were making millions.\nIn fact, this is the sign of a successful\npivot: the new experiments you run\nare overall more productive than the\nexperiments you were running\nbefore.\nThis is the pattern: poor\nquantitative results force us to\ndeclare failure and create the\nmotivation, context, and space for\nmore qualitative research. These\ninvestigations produce new ideas—\nnew hypotheses—to be tested,\nleading to a possible pivot. Each\npivot unlocks new opportunities for\nfurther experimentation, and the\ncycle repeats. Each time we repeat\nthis simple rhythm: establish the\nbaseline, tune the engine, and make a\ndecision to pivot or persevere.\nOPTIMIZATION VERSUS\nLEARNING\nEngineers, designers, and marketers\nare all skilled at optimization. For\nexample, direct marketers are\nexperienced at split testing value\npropositions by sending a different\noffer to two similar groups of\ncustomers so that they can measure\ndifferences in the response rates of\nthe two groups. Engineers, of course,\nare skilled at improving a product’s\nperformance, just as designers are\ntalented at making products easier to\nuse. All these activities in a well-run\ntraditional organization offer\nincremental benefit for incremental\neffort. As long as we are executing\nthe plan well, hard work yields\nresults.\nHowever, these tools for product\nimprovement do not work the same\nway for startups. If you are building\nthe wrong thing, optimizing the\nproduct or its marketing will not\nyield significant results. A startup\nhas to measure progress against a\nhigh bar: evidence that a sustainable\nbusiness can be built around its\nproducts or services. That’s a\nstandard that can be assessed only if\na startup has made clear, tangible\npredictions ahead of time.\nIn the absence of those\npredictions, product and strategy\ndecisions are far more difficult and\ntime-consuming. I often see this in\nmy consulting practice. I’ve been\ncalled in many times to help a startup\nthat feels that its engineering team\n“isn’t working hard enough.” When I\nmeet with those teams, there are\nalways improvements to be made\nand I recommend them, but\ninvariably the real problem is not a\nlack of development talent, energy,\nor effort. Cycle after cycle, the team\nis working hard, but the business is\nnot seeing results. Managers trained\nin a traditional model draw the\nlogical conclusion: our team is not\nworking hard, not working\neffectively, or not working\nefficiently.\nThus the downward cycle begins:\nthe product development team\nvaliantly tries to build a product\naccording to the specifications it is\nreceiving from the creative or\nbusiness leadership. When good\nresults are not forthcoming, business\nleaders assume that any discrepancy\nbetween what was planned and what\nwas built is the cause and try to\nspecify the next iteration in greater\ndetail. As the specifications get more\ndetailed, the planning process slows\ndown, batch size increases, and\nfeedback is delayed. If a board of\ndirectors or CFO is involved as a\nstakeholder, it doesn’t take long for\npersonnel changes to follow.\nA few years ago, a team that sells\nproducts to large media companies\ninvited me to help them as a\nconsultant because they were\nconcerned that their engineers were\nnot working hard enough. However,\nthe fault was not in the engineers; it\nwas in the process the whole\ncompany was using to make\ndecisions. They had customers but\ndid not know them very well. They\nwere deluged with feature requests\nfrom customers, the internal sales\nteam, and the business leadership.\nEvery new insight became an\nemergency that had to be addressed\nimmediately. As a result, long-term\nprojects were hampered by constant\ninterruptions. Even worse, the team\nhad no clear sense of whether any of\nthe changes they were making\nmattered to customers. Despite the\nconstant tuning and tweaking, the\nbusiness results were consistently\nmediocre.\nLearning milestones prevent this\nnegative spiral by emphasizing a\nmore likely possibility: the company\nis executing—with discipline!—a\nplan that does not make sense. The\ninnovation accounting framework\nmakes it clear when the company is\nstuck and needs to change direction.\nIn the example above, early in the\ncompany’s life, the product\ndevelopment team was incredibly\nproductive because the company’s\nfounders had identified a large unmet\nneed in the target market. The initial\nproduct, while flawed, was popular\nwith early adopters. Adding the\nmajor features that customers asked\nfor seemed to work wonders, as the\nearly adopters spread the word about\nthe innovation far and wide. But\nunasked and unanswered were other\nlurking questions: Did the company\nhave a working engine of growth?\nWas this early success related to the\ndaily work of the product\ndevelopment team? In most cases,\nthe answer was no; success was\ndriven by decisions the team had\nmade in the past. None of its current\ninitiatives were having any impact.\nBut this was obscured because the\ncompany’s gross metrics were all\n“up and to the right.”\nAs we’ll see in a moment, this is a\ncommon danger. Companies of any\nsize that have a working engine of\ngrowth can come to rely on the\nwrong kind of metrics to guide their\nactions. This is what tempts\nmanagers to resort to the usual bag\nof success theater tricks: last-minute\nad buys, channel stuffing, and whizbang demos, in a desperate attempt\nto make the gross numbers look\nbetter. Energy invested in success\ntheater is energy that could have\nbeen used to help build a sustainable\nbusiness. I call the traditional\nnumbers used to judge startups\n“vanity metrics,” and innovation\naccounting requires us to avoid the\ntemptation to use them.\nVANITY METRICS: A WORD\nOF CAUTION\nTo see the danger of vanity metrics\nclearly, let’s return once more to the\nearly days of IMVU. Take a look at\nthe following graph, which is from\nthe same era in IMVU’s history as\nthat shown earlier in this chapter. It\ncovers the same time period as the\ncohort-style graph on this page; in\nfact, it is from the same board\npresentation.\nThis graph shows the traditional\ngross metrics for IMVU so far: total\nregistered users and total paying\ncustomers (the gross revenue graph\nlooks almost the same). From this\nviewpoint, things look much more\nexciting. That’s why I call these\nvanity metrics: they give the rosiest\npossible picture. You’ll see a\ntraditional hockey stick graph (the\nideal in a rapid-growth company). As\nlong as you focus on the top-line\nnumbers (signing up more\ncustomers, an increase in overall\nrevenue), you’ll be forgiven for\nthinking this product development\nteam is making great progress. The\ncompany’s growth engine is\nworking. Each month it is able to\nacquire customers and has a positive\nreturn on investment. The excess\nrevenue from those customers is\nreinvested the next month in\nacquiring more. That’s where the\ngrowth is coming from.\nBut think back to the same data\npresented in a cohort style. IMVU is\nadding new customers, but it is not\nimproving the yield on each new\ngroup. The engine is turning, but the\nefforts to tune the engine are not\nbearing much fruit. From the\ntraditional graph alone, you cannot\ntell whether IMVU is on pace to\nbuild a sustainable business; you\ncertainly can’t tell anything about the\nefficacy of the entrepreneurial team\nbehind it.\nInnovation accounting will not\nwork if a startup is being misled by\nthese kinds of vanity metrics: gross\nnumber of customers and so on. The\nalternative is the kind of metrics we\nuse to judge our business and our\nlearning milestones, what I call\nactionable metrics.\nACTIONABLE METRICS\nVERSUS VANITY METRICS\nTo get a better sense of the\nimportance of good metrics, let’s\nlook at a company called Grockit. Its\nfounder, Farbood Nivi, spent a\ndecade working as a teacher at two\nlarge for-profit education companies,\nPrinceton Review and Kaplan,\nhelping students prepare for\nstandardized tests such as the\nGMAT, LSAT, and SAT. His\nengaging classroom style won\naccolades from his students and\npromotions from his superiors; he\nwas honored with Princeton\nReview’s National Teacher of the\nYear award. But Farb was frustrated\nwith the traditional teaching methods\nused by those companies. Teaching\nsix to nine hours per day to\nthousands of students, he had many\nopportunities to experiment with new\napproaches.2\nOver time, Farb concluded that the\ntraditional lecture model of\neducation, with its one-to-many\ninstructional approach, was\ninadequate for his students. He set\nout to develop a superior approach,\nusing a combination of teacher-led\nlectures, individual homework, and\ngroup study. In particular, Farb was\nfascinated by how effective the\nstudent-to-student peer-driven\nlearning method was for his students.\nWhen students could help each\nother, they benefited in two ways.\nFirst, they could get customized\ninstruction from a peer who was\nmuch less intimidating than a\nteacher. Second, they could reinforce\ntheir learning by teaching it to others.\nOver time, Farb’s classes became\nincreasingly social—and successful.\nAs this unfolded, Farb felt more\nand more that his physical presence\nin the classroom was less important.\nHe made an important connection: “I\nhave this social learning model in my\nclassroom. There’s all this social\nstuff going on on the web.” His idea\nwas to bring social peer-to-peer\nlearning to people who could not\nafford an expensive class from\nKaplan or Princeton Review or an\neven more expensive private tutor.\nFrom this insight Grockit was born.\nFarb explains, “Whether you’re\nstudying for the SAT or you’re\nstudying for algebra, you study in\none of three ways. You spend some\ntime with experts, you spend some\ntime on your own, and you spend\nsome time with your peers. Grockit\noffers these three same formats of\nstudying. What we do is we apply\ntechnology and algorithms to\noptimize those three forms.”\nFarb is the classic entrepreneurial\nvisionary. He recounts his original\ninsight this way: “Let’s forget\neducational design up until now, let’s\nforget what’s possible and just\nredesign learning with today’s\nstudents and today’s technology in\nmind. There were plenty of multibillion-dollar organizations in the\neducation space, and I don’t think\nthey were innovating in the way that\nwe needed them to and I didn’t think\nwe needed them anymore. To me,\nit’s really all about the students and I\ndidn’t feel like the students were\nbeing served as well as they could.”\nToday Grockit offers many\ndifferent educational products, but in\nthe beginning Farb followed a lean\napproach. Grockit built a minimum\nviable product, which was simply\nFarb teaching test prep via the\npopular online web conferencing tool\nWebEx. He built no custom\nsoftware, no new technology. He\nsimply attempted to bring his new\nteaching approach to students via the\nInternet. News about a new kind of\nprivate tutoring spread quickly, and\nwithin a few months Farb was\nmaking a decent living teaching\nonline, with monthly revenues of\n$10,000 to $15,000. But like many\nentrepreneurs with ambition, Farb\ndidn’t build his MVP just to make a\nliving. He had a vision of a more\ncollaborative, more effective kind of\nteaching for students everywhere.\nWith his initial traction, he was able\nto raise money from some of the\nmost prestigious investors in Silicon\nValley.\nWhen I first met Farb, his\ncompany was already on the fast\ntrack to success. They had raised\nventure capital from well-regarded\ninvestors, had built an awesome\nteam, and were fresh off an\nimpressive debut at one of Silicon\nValley’s famous startup\ncompetitions.\nThey were extremely processoriented and disciplined. Their\nproduct development followed a\nrigorous version of the agile\ndevelopment methodology known as\nExtreme Programming (described\nbelow), thanks to their partnership\nwith a San Francisco–based\ncompany called Pivotal Labs. Their\nearly product was hailed by the press\nas a breakthrough.\nThere was only one problem: they\nwere not seeing sufficient growth in\nthe use of the product by customers.\nGrockit is an excellent case study\nbecause its problems were not a\nmatter of failure of execution or\ndiscipline.\nFollowing standard agile practice,\nGrockit’s work proceeded in a series\no f sprints, or one-month iteration\ncycles. For each sprint, Farb would\nprioritize the work to be done that\nmonth by writing a series of user\nstories, a technique taken from agile\ndevelopment. Instead of writing a\nspecification for a new feature that\ndescribed it in technical terms, Farb\nwould write a story that described\nthe feature from the point of view of\nthe customer. That story helped keep\nthe engineers focused on the\ncustomer’s perspective throughout\nthe development process.\nEach feature was expressed in\nplain language in terms everyone\ncould understand whether they had a\ntechnical background or not. Again\nfollowing standard agile practice,\nFarb was free to reprioritize these\nstories at any time. As he learned\nmore about what customers wanted,\nhe could move things around in the\nproduct backlog, the queue of stories\nyet to be built. The only limit on this\nability to change directions was that\nhe could not interrupt any task that\nwas in progress. Fortunately, the\nstories were written in such a way\nthat the batch size of work (which\nI’ll discuss in more detail in Chapter\n9) was only a day or two.\nThis system is called agile\ndevelopment for a good reason:\nteams that employ it are able to\nchange direction quickly, stay light\non their feet, and be highly\nresponsive to changes in the business\nrequirements of the product owner\n(the manager of the process—in this\ncase Farb—who is responsible for\nprioritizing the stories).\nHow did the team feel at the end\nof each sprint? They consistently\ndelivered new product features. They\nwould collect feedback from\ncustomers in the form of anecdotes\nand interviews that indicated that at\nleast some customers liked the new\nfeatures. There was always a certain\namount of data that showed\nimprovement: perhaps the total\nnumber of customers was increasing,\nthe total number of questions\nanswered by students was going up,\nor the number of returning customers\nwas increasing.\nHowever, I sensed that Farb and\nhis team were left with lingering\ndoubts about the company’s overall\nprogress. Was the increase in their\nnumbers actually caused by their\ndevelopment efforts? Or could it be\ndue to other factors, such as\nmentions of Grockit in the press?\nWhen I met the team, I asked them\nthis simple question: How do you\nknow that the prioritization decisions\nthat Farb is making actually make\nsense?\nTheir answer: “That’s not our\ndepartment. Farb makes the\ndecisions; we execute them.”\nAt that time Grockit was focused\non just one customer segment:\nprospective business school students\nwho were studying for the GMAT.\nThe product allowed students to\nengage in online study sessions with\nfellow students who were studying\nfor the same exam. The product was\nworking: the students who completed\ntheir studying via Grockit achieved\nsignificantly higher scores than they\nhad before. But the Grockit team was\nstruggling with the age-old startup\nproblems: How do we know which\nfeatures to prioritize? How can we\nget more customers to sign up and\npay? How can we get out the word\nabout our product?\nI put this question to Farb: “How\nconfident are you that you are\nmaking the right decisions in terms\nof establishing priorities?” Like most\nstartup founders, he was looking at\nthe available data and making the\nbest educated guesses he could. But\nthis left a lot of room for ambiguity\nand doubt.\nFarb believed in his vision\nthoroughly and completely, yet he\nwas starting to question whether his\ncompany was on pace to realize that\nvision. The product improved every\nday, but Farb wanted to make sure\nthose improvements mattered to\ncustomers. I believe he deserves a lot\nof credit for realizing this. Unlike\nmany visionaries, who cling to their\noriginal vision no matter what, Farb\nwas willing to put his vision to the\ntest.\nFarb worked hard to sustain his\nteam’s belief that Grockit was\ndestined for success. He was worried\nthat morale would suffer if anyone\nthought that the person steering the\nship was uncertain about which\ndirection to go. Farb himself wasn’t\nsure if his team would embrace a\ntrue learning culture. After all, this\nwas part of the grand bargain of agile\ndevelopment: engineers agree to\nadapt the product to the business’s\nconstantly changing requirements\nbut are not responsible for the quality\nof those business decisions.\nAgile is an efficient system of\ndevelopment from the point of view\nof the developers. It allows them to\nstay focused on creating features and\ntechnical designs. An attempt to\nintroduce the need to learn into that\nprocess could undermine\nproductivity.\n(Lean manufacturing faced similar\nproblems when it was introduced in\nfactories. Managers were used to\nfocusing on the utilization rate of\neach machine. Factories were\ndesigned to keep machines running\nat full capacity as much of the time\nas possible. Viewed from the\nperspective of the machine, that is\nefficient, but from the point of view\nof the productivity of the entire\nfactory, it is wildly inefficient at\ntimes. As they say in systems theory,\nthat which optimizes one part of the\nsystem necessarily undermines the\nsystem as a whole.)\nWhat Farb and his team didn’t\nrealize was that Grockit’s progress\nwas being measured by vanity\nmetrics: the total number of\ncustomers and the total number of\nquestions answered. That was what\nwas causing his team to spin its\nwheels; those metrics gave the team\nthe sensation of forward motion even\nthough the company was making\nlittle progress. What’s interesting is\nhow closely Farb’s method followed\nsuperficial aspects of the Lean\nStartup learning milestones: they\nshipped an early product and\nestablished some baseline metrics.\nThey had relatively short iterations,\neach of which was judged by its\nability to improve customer metrics.\nHowever, because Grockit was\nusing the wrong kinds of metrics, the\nstartup was not genuinely improving.\nFarb was frustrated in his efforts to\nlearn from customer feedback. In\nevery cycle, the type of metrics his\nteam was focused on would change:\none month they would look at gross\nusage numbers, another month\nregistration numbers, and so on.\nThose metrics would go up and\ndown seemingly on their own. He\ncouldn’t draw clear cause-and-effect\ninferences. Prioritizing work\ncorrectly in such an environment is\nextremely challenging.\nFarb could have asked his data\nanalyst to investigate a particular\nquestion. For example, when we\nshipped feature X, did it affect\ncustomer behavior? But that would\nhave required tremendous time and\neffort. When, exactly, did feature X\nship? Which customers were\nexposed to it? Was anything else\nlaunched around that same time?\nWere there seasonal factors that\nmight be skewing the data? Finding\nthese answers would have required\nparsing reams and reams of data. The\nanswer often would come weeks\nafter the question had been asked. In\nthe meantime, the team would have\nmoved on to new priorities and new\nquestions that needed urgent\nattention.\nCompared to a lot of startups, the\nGrockit team had a huge advantage:\nthey were tremendously disciplined.\nA disciplined team may apply the\nwrong methodology but can shift\ngears quickly once it discovers its\nerror. Most important, a disciplined\nteam can experiment with its own\nworking style and draw meaningful\nconclusions.\nCohorts and Split-tests\nGrockit changed the metrics they\nused to evaluate success in two\nways. Instead of looking at gross\nmetrics, Grockit switched to cohortbased metrics, and instead of looking\nfor cause-and-effect relationships\nafter the fact, Grockit would launch\neach new feature as a true split-test\nexperiment.\nA split-test experiment is one in\nwhich different versions of a product\nare offered to customers at the same\ntime. By observing the changes in\nbehavior between the two groups,\none can make inferences about the\nimpact of the different variations.\nThis technique was pioneered by\ndirect mail advertisers. For example,\nconsider a company that sends\ncustomers a catalog of products to\nbuy, such as Lands’ End or Crate &\nBarrel. If you wanted to test a\ncatalog design, you could send a new\nversion of it to 50 percent of the\ncustomers and send the old standard\ncatalog to the other 50 percent. To\nassure a scientific result, both\ncatalogs would contain identical\nproducts; the only difference would\nbe the changes to the design. To\nfigure out if the new design was\neffective, all you would have to do\nwas keep track of the sales figures\nfor both groups of customers. (This\ntechnique is sometimes called A/B\ntesting after the practice of assigning\nletter names to each variation.)\nAlthough split testing often is\nthought of as a marketing-specific\n(or even a direct marketing–specific)\npractice, Lean Startups incorporate it\ndirectly into product development.\nThese changes led to an\nimmediate change in Farb’s\nunderstanding of the business. Split\ntesting often uncovers surprising\nthings. For example, many features\nthat make the product better in the\neyes of engineers and designers have\nno impact on customer behavior.\nThis was the case at Grockit, as it\nhas been in every company I have\nseen adopt this technique. Although\nworking with split tests seems to be\nmore difficult because it requires\nextra accounting and metrics to keep\ntrack of each variation, it almost\nalways saves tremendous amounts of\ntime in the long run by eliminating\nwork that doesn’t matter to\ncustomers.\nSplit testing also helps teams\nrefine their understanding of what\ncustomers want and don’t want.\nGrockit’s team constantly added new\nways for their customers to interact\nwith each other in the hope that those\nsocial communication tools would\nincrease the product’s value.\nInherent in those efforts was the\nbelief that customers desired more\ncommunication during their\nstudying. When split testing revealed\nthat the extra features did not change\ncustomer behavior, it called that\nbelief into question.\nThe questioning inspired the team\nto seek a deeper understanding of\nwhat customers really wanted. They\nbrainstormed new ideas for product\nexperiments that might have more\nimpact. In fact, many of these ideas\nwere not new. They had simply been\noverlooked because the company\nwas focused on building social tools.\nAs a result, Grockit tested an\nintensive solo-studying mode,\ncomplete with quests and gamelike\nlevels, so that students could have\nthe choice of studying by themselves\nor with others. Just as in Farb’s\noriginal classroom, this proved\nextremely effective. Without the\ndiscipline of split testing, the\ncompany might not have had this\nrealization. In fact, over time,\nthrough dozens of tests, it became\nclear that the key to student\nengagement was to offer them a\ncombination of social and solo\nfeatures. Students preferred having a\nchoice of how to study.\nKanban\nFollowing the lean manufacturing\nprinciple of kanban, or capacity\nconstraint, Grockit changed the\nproduct prioritization process. Under\nthe new system, user stories were not\nconsidered complete until they led to\nvalidated learning. Thus, stories\ncould be cataloged as being in one of\nfour states of development: in the\nproduct backlog, actively being built,\ndone (feature complete from a\ntechnical point of view), or in the\nprocess of being validated. Validated\nwas defined as “knowing whether\nthe story was a good idea to have\nbeen done in the first place.” This\nvalidation usually would come in the\nform of a split test showing a change\nin customer behavior but also might\ninclude customer interviews or\nsurveys.\nThe kanban rule permitted only so\nmany stories in each of the four\nstates. As stories flow from one state\nto the other, the buckets fill up. Once\na bucket becomes full, it cannot\naccept more stories. Only when a\nstory has been validated can it be\nremoved from the kanban board. If\nthe validation fails and it turns out\nthe story is a bad idea, the relevant\nfeature is removed from the product\n(see the chart on this page).\nKANBAN DIAGRAM OF\nWORK AS IT PROGRESSES\nFROM STAGE TO STAGE\n(No bucket can contain\nmore than three projects at a\ntime.)\nWork on A begins. D and E\nare in development. F awaits\nvalidation.\nF is validated. D and E\nawait validation. G, H, I are\nnew tasks to be undertaken. B\nand C are being built. A\ncompletes development.\nB and C have been built, but\nunder kanban, cannot be moved\nto the next bucket for validation\nuntil A, D, E have been\nvalidated. Work cannot begin\non H and I until space opens up\nin the buckets ahead.\nI have implemented this system\nwith several teams, and the initial\nresult is always frustrating: each\nbucket fills up, starting with the\n“validated” bucket and moving on to\nthe “done” bucket, until it’s not\npossible to start any more work.\nTeams that are used to measuring\ntheir productivity narrowly, by the\nnumber of stories they are delivering,\nfeel stuck. The only way to start\nwork on new features is to\ninvestigate some of the stories that\nare done but haven’t been validated.\nThat often requires nonengineering\nefforts: talking to customers, looking\nat split-test data, and the like.\nPretty soon everyone gets the hang\nof it. This progress occurs in fits and\nstarts at first. Engineering may finish\na big batch of work, followed by\nextensive testing and validation. As\nengineers look for ways to increase\ntheir productivity, they start to\nrealize that if they include the\nvalidation exercise from the\nbeginning, the whole team can be\nmore productive.\nFor example, why build a new\nfeature that is not part of a split-test\nexperiment? It may save you time in\nthe short run, but it will take more\ntime later to test, during the\nvalidation phase. The same logic\napplies to a story that an engineer\ndoesn’t understand. Under the old\nsystem, he or she would just build it\nand find out later what it was for. In\nthe new system, that behavior is\nclearly counterproductive: without a\nclear hypothesis, how can a story\never be validated? We saw this\nbehavior at IMVU, too. I once saw a\njunior engineer face down a senior\nexecutive over a relatively minor\nchange. The engineer insisted that\nthe new feature be split-tested, just\nlike any other. His peers backed him\nup; it was considered absolutely\nobvious that all features should be\nroutinely tested, no matter who was\ncommissioning them.\n(Embarrassingly, all too often I was\nthe executive in question.) A solid\nprocess lays the foundation for a\nhealthy culture, one where ideas are\nevaluated by merit and not by job\ntitle.\nMost important, teams working in\nthis system begin to measure their\nproductivity according to validated\nlearning, not in terms of the\nproduction of new features.\nHypothesis Testing at Grockit\nWhen Grockit made this transition,\nthe results were dramatic. In one\ncase, they decided to test one of their\nmajor features, called lazy\nregistration, to see if it was worth the\nheavy investment they were making\nin ongoing support. They were\nconfident in this feature because lazy\nregistration is considered one of the\ndesign best practices for online\nservices. In this system, customers\ndo not have to register for the service\nup front. Instead, they immediately\nbegin using the service and are asked\nto register only after they have had a\nchance to experience the service’s\nbenefit.\nFor a student, lazy registration\nworks like this: when you come to\nthe Grockit website, you’re\nimmediately placed in a study\nsession with other students working\non the same test. You don’t have to\ngive your name, e-mail address, or\ncredit card number. There is nothing\nto prevent you from jumping in and\ngetting started immediately. For\nGrockit, this was essential to testing\none of its core assumptions: that\ncustomers would be willing to adopt\nthis new way of learning only if they\ncould see proof that it was working\nearly on.\nAs a result of this hypothesis,\nGrockit’s design required that it\nmanage three classes of users:\nunregistered guests, registered (trial)\nguests, and customers who had paid\nfor the premium version of the\nproduct. This design required\nsignificant extra work to build and\nmaintain: the more classes of users\nthere are, the more work is required\nto keep track of them, and the more\nmarketing effort is required to create\nthe right incentives to entice\ncustomers to upgrade to the next\nclass. Grockit had undertaken this\nextra effort because lazy registration\nwas considered an industry best\npractice.\nI encouraged the team to try a\nsimple split-test. They took one\ncohort of customers and required that\nthey register immediately, based on\nnothing more than Grockit’s\nmarketing materials. To their\nsurprise, this cohort’s behavior was\nexactly the same as that of the lazy\nregistration group: they had the same\nrate of registration, activation, and\nsubsequent retention. In other words,\nthe extra effort of lazy registration\nwas a complete waste even though it\nwas considered an industry best\npractice.\nEven more important than\nreducing waste was the insight that\nthis test suggested: customers were\nbasing their decision about Grockit\non something other than their use of\nthe product.\nThink about this. Think about the\ncohort of customers who were\nrequired to register for the product\nbefore entering a study session with\nother students. They had very little\ninformation about the product,\nnothing more than was presented on\nGrockit’s home page and registration\npage. By contrast, the lazy\nregistration group had a tremendous\namount of information about the\nproduct because they had used it. Yet\ndespite this information disparity,\ncustomer behavior was exactly the\nsame.\nThis suggested that improving\nGrockit’s positioning and marketing\nmight have a more significant impact\non attracting new customers than\nwould adding new features. This was\njust the first of many important\nexperiments Grockit was able to run.\nSince those early days, they have\nexpanded their customer base\ndramatically: they now offer test\nprep for numerous standardized tests,\nincluding the GMAT, SAT, ACT,\nand GRE, as well as online math and\nEnglish courses for students in\ngrades 7 through 12.\nGrockit continues to evolve its\nprocess, seeking continuous\nimprovement at every turn. With\nmore than twenty employees in its\nSan Francisco office, Grockit\ncontinues to operate with the same\ndeliberate, disciplined approach that\nhas been their hallmark all along.\nThey have helped close to a million\nstudents and are sure to help millions\nmore.\nTHE VALUE OF THE THREE\nA’S\nThese examples from Grockit\ndemonstrate each of the three A’s of\nmetrics: actionable, accessible, and\nauditable.\nActionable\nFor a report to be considered\nactionable, it must demonstrate clear\ncause and effect. Otherwise, it is a\nvanity metric. The reports that\nGrockit’s team began to use to judge\ntheir learning milestones made it\nextremely clear what actions would\nbe necessary to replicate the results.\nBy contrast, vanity metrics fail\nthis criterion. Take the number of\nhits to a company website. Let’s say\nwe have 40,000 hits this month—a\nnew record. What do we need to do\nto get more hits? Well, that depends.\nWhere are the new hits coming\nfrom? Is it from 40,000 new\ncustomers or from one guy with an\nextremely active web browser? Are\nthe hits the result of a new marketing\ncampaign or PR push? What is a hit,\nanyway? Does each page in the\nbrowser count as one hit, or do all\nthe embedded images and\nmultimedia content count as well?\nThose who have sat in a meeting\ndebating the units of measurement in\na report will recognize this problem.\nVanity metrics wreak havoc\nbecause they prey on a weakness of\nthe human mind. In my experience,\nwhen the numbers go up, people\nthink the improvement was caused\nby their actions, by whatever they\nwere working on at the time. That is\nwhy it’s so common to have a\nmeeting in which marketing thinks\nthe numbers went up because of a\nnew PR or marketing effort and\nengineering thinks the better\nnumbers are the result of the new\nfeatures it added. Finding out what is\nactually going on is extremely costly,\nand so most managers simply move\non, doing the best they can to form\ntheir own judgment on the basis of\ntheir experience and the collective\nintelligence in the room.\nUnfortunately, when the numbers\ngo down, it results in a very different\nreaction: now it’s somebody else’s\nfault. Thus, most team members or\ndepartments live in a world where\ntheir department is constantly\nmaking things better, only to have\ntheir hard work sabotaged by other\ndepartments that just don’t get it. Is it\nany wonder these departments\ndevelop their own distinct language,\njargon, culture, and defense\nmechanisms against the bozos\nworking down the hall?\nActionable metrics are the antidote\nto this problem. When cause and\neffect is clearly understood, people\nare better able to learn from their\nactions. Human beings are innately\ntalented learners when given a clear\nand objective assessment.\nAccessible\nAll too many reports are not\nunderstood by the employees and\nmanagers who are supposed to use\nthem to guide their decision making.\nUnfortunately, most managers do not\nrespond to this complexity by\nworking hand in hand with the data\nwarehousing team to simplify the\nreports so that they can understand\nthem better. Departments too often\nspend their energy learning how to\nuse data to get what they want rather\nthan as genuine feedback to guide\ntheir future actions.\nThere is an antidote to this misuse\nof data. First, make the reports as\nsimple as possible so that everyone\nunderstands them. Remember the\nsaying “Metrics are people, too.”\nThe easiest way to make reports\ncomprehensible is to use tangible,\nconcrete units. What is a website hit?\nNobody is really sure, but everyone\nknows what a person visiting the\nwebsite is: one can practically\npicture those people sitting at their\ncomputers.\nThis is why cohort-based reports\nare the gold standard of learning\nmetrics: they turn complex actions\ninto people-based reports. Each\ncohort analysis says: among the\npeople who used our product in this\nperiod, here’s how many of them\nexhibited each of the behaviors we\ncare about. In the IMVU example,\nwe saw four behaviors: downloading\nthe product, logging into the product\nfrom one’s computer, engaging in a\nchat with other customers, and\nupgrading to the paid version of the\nproduct. In other words, the report\ndeals with people and their actions,\nwhich are far more useful than piles\nof data points. For example, think\nabout how hard it would have been\nto tell if IMVU was being successful\nif we had reported only on the total\nnumber of person-to-person\nconversations. Let’s say we have\n10,000 conversations in a period. Is\nthat good? Is that one person being\nvery, very social, or is it 10,000\npeople each trying the product one\ntime and then giving up? There’s no\nway to know without creating a more\ndetailed report.\nAs the gross numbers get larger,\naccessibility becomes more and\nmore important. It is hard to\nvisualize what it means if the number\nof website hits goes down from\n250,000 in one month to 200,000 the\nnext month, but most people\nunderstand immediately what it\nmeans to lose 50,000 customers.\nThat’s practically a whole stadium\nfull of people who are abandoning\nthe product.\nAccessibility also refers to\nwidespread access to the reports.\nGrockit did this especially well.\nEvery day their system automatically\ngenerated a document containing the\nlatest data for every single one of\ntheir split-test experiments and other\nleap-of-faith metrics. This document\nwas mailed to every employee of the\ncompany: they all always had a fresh\ncopy in their e-mail in-boxes. The\nreports were well laid out and easy to\nread, with each experiment and its\nresults explained in plain English.\nAnother way to make reports\naccessible is to use a technique we\ndeveloped at IMVU. Instead of\nhousing the analytics or data in a\nseparate system, our reporting data\nand its infrastructure were\nconsidered part of the product itself\nand were owned by the product\ndevelopment team. The reports were\navailable on our website, accessible\nto anyone with an employee account.\nEach employee could log in to the\nsystem at any time, choose from a\nlist of all current and past\nexperiments, and see a simple onepage summary of the results. Over\ntime, those one-page summaries\nbecame the de facto standard for\nsettling product arguments\nthroughout the organization. When\npeople needed evidence to support\nsomething they had learned, they\nwould bring a printout with them to\nthe relevant meeting, confident that\neveryone they showed it to would\nunderstand its meaning.\nAuditable\nWhen informed that their pet project\nis a failure, most of us are tempted to\nblame the messenger, the data, the\nmanager, the gods, or anything else\nwe can think of. That’s why the third\nA of good metrics, “auditable,” is so\nessential. We must ensure that the\ndata is credible to employees.\nThe employees at IMVU would\nbrandish one-page reports to\ndemonstrate what they had learned to\nsettle arguments, but the process\noften wasn’t so smooth. Most of the\ntime, when a manager, developer, or\nteam was confronted with results that\nwould kill a pet project, the loser of\nthe argument would challenge the\nveracity of the data.\nSuch challenges are more common\nthan most managers would admit,\nand unfortunately, most data\nreporting systems are not designed to\nanswer them successfully.\nSometimes this is the result of a\nwell-intentioned but misplaced\ndesire to protect the privacy of\ncustomers. More often, the lack of\nsuch supporting documentation is\nsimply a matter of neglect. Most data\nreporting systems are not built by\nproduct development teams, whose\njob is to prioritize and build product\nfeatures. They are built by business\nmanagers and analysts. Managers\nwho must use these systems can only\ncheck to see if the reports are\nmutually consistent. They all too\noften lack a way to test if the data is\nconsistent with reality.\nThe solution? First, remember that\n“Metrics are people, too.” We need\nto be able to test the data by hand, in\nthe messy real world, by talking to\ncustomers. This is the only way to be\nable to check if the reports contain\ntrue facts. Managers need the ability\nto spot check the data with real\ncustomers. It also has a second\nbenefit: systems that provide this\nlevel of auditability give managers\nand entrepreneurs the opportunity to\ngain insights into why customers are\nbehaving the way the data indicate.\nSecond, those building reports\nmust make sure the mechanisms that\ngenerate the reports are not too\ncomplex. Whenever possible, reports\nshould be drawn directly from the\nmaster data, rather than from an\nintermediate system, which reduces\nopportunities for error. I have noticed\nthat every time a team has one of its\njudgments or assumptions\noverturned as a result of a technical\nproblem with the data, its\nconfidence, morale, and discipline\nare undermined.\nWhen we watch entrepreneurs\nsucceed in the mythmaking world of\nHollywood, books, and magazines,\nthe story is always structured the\nsame way. First, we see the plucky\nprotagonist having an epiphany,\nhatching a great new idea. We learn\nabout his or her character and\npersonality, how he or she came to\nbe in the right place at the right time,\nand how he or she took the dramatic\nleap to start a business.\nThen the photo montage begins.\nIt’s usually short, just a few minutes\nof time-lapse photography or\nnarrative. We see the protagonist\nbuilding a team, maybe working in a\nlab, writing on whiteboards, closing\nsales, pounding on a few keyboards.\nAt the end of the montage, the\nfounders are successful, and the\nstory can move on to more\ninteresting fare: how to split the\nspoils of their success, who will\nappear on magazine covers, who\nsues whom, and implications for the\nfuture.\nUnfortunately, the real work that\ndetermines the success of startups\nhappens during the photo montage. It\ndoesn’t make the cut in terms of the\nbig story because it is too boring.\nOnly 5 percent of entrepreneurship is\nthe big idea, the business model, the\nwhiteboard strategizing, and the\nsplitting up of the spoils. The other\n95 percent is the gritty work that is\nmeasured by innovation accounting:\nproduct prioritization decisions,\ndeciding which customers to target\nor listen to, and having the courage\nto subject a grand vision to constant\ntesting and feedback.\nOne decision stands out above all\nothers as the most difficult, the most\ntime-consuming, and the biggest\nsource of waste for most startups.\nWe all must face this fundamental\ntest: deciding when to pivot and\nwhen to persevere. To understand\nwhat happens during the photo\nmontage, we have to understand how\nto pivot, and that is the subject of\nChapter 8.\n8\nPIVOT (OR PERSEVERE)\nEvery entrepreneur eventually faces\nan overriding challenge in\ndeveloping a successful product:\ndeciding when to pivot and when to\npersevere. Everything that has been\ndiscussed so far is a prelude to a\nseemingly simple question: are we\nmaking sufficient progress to believe\nthat our original strategic hypothesis\nis correct, or do we need to make a\nmajor change? That change is called\na pivot: a structured course\ncorrection designed to test a new\nfundamental hypothesis about the\nproduct, strategy, and engine of\ngrowth.\nBecause of the scientific\nmethodology that underlies the Lean\nStartup, there is often a\nmisconception that it offers a rigid\nclinical formula for making pivot or\npersevere decisions. This is not true.\nThere is no way to remove the\nhuman element—vision, intuition,\njudgment—from the practice of\nentrepreneurship, nor would that be\ndesirable.\nMy goal in advocating a scientific\napproach to the creation of startups is\nto channel human creativity into its\nmost productive form, and there is no\nbigger destroyer of creative potential\nthan the misguided decision to\npersevere. Companies that cannot\nbring themselves to pivot to a new\ndirection on the basis of feedback\nfrom the marketplace can get stuck\nin the land of the living dead, neither\ngrowing enough nor dying,\nconsuming resources and\ncommitment from employees and\nother stakeholders but not moving\nahead.\nThere is good news about our\nreliance on judgment, though. We\nare able to learn, we are innately\ncreative, and we have a remarkable\nability to see the signal in the noise.\nIn fact, we are so good at this that\nsometimes we see signals that aren’t\nthere. The heart of the scientific\nmethod is the realization that\nalthough human judgment may be\nfaulty, we can improve our judgment\nby subjecting our theories to\nrepeated testing.\nStartup productivity is not about\ncranking out more widgets or\nfeatures. It is about aligning our\nefforts with a business and product\nthat are working to create value and\ndrive growth. In other words,\nsuccessful pivots put us on a path\ntoward growing a sustainable\nbusiness.\nINNOVATION ACCOUNTING\nLEADS TO FASTER PIVOTS\nTo see this process in action, meet\nDavid Binetti, the CEO of Votizen.\nDavid has had a long career helping\nto bring the American political\nprocess into the twenty-first century.\nIn the early 1990s, he helped build\nUSA.gov, the first portal for the\nfederal government. He’s also\nexperienced some classic startup\nfailures. When it came time to build\nVotizen, David was determined to\navoid betting the farm on his vision.\nDavid wanted to tackle the\nproblem of civic participation in the\npolitical process. His first product\nconcept was a social network of\nverified voters, a place where people\npassionate about civic causes could\nget together, share ideas, and recruit\ntheir friends. David built his first\nminimum viable product for just over\n$1,200 in about three months and\nlaunched it.\nDavid wasn’t building something\nthat nobody wanted. In fact, from its\nearliest days, Votizen was able to\nattract early adopters who loved the\ncore concept. Like all entrepreneurs,\nDavid had to refine his product and\nbusiness model. What made David’s\nchallenge especially hard was that he\nhad to make those pivots in the face\nof moderate success.\nDavid’s initial concept involved\nfour big leaps of faith:\n1. Customers would be\ninterested enough in the\nsocial network to sign up.\n(Registration)\n2. Votizen would be able to\nverify them as registered\nvoters. (Activation)\n3. Customers who were verified\nvoters would engage with the\nsite’s activism tools over\ntime. (Retention)\n4. Engaged customers would\ntell their friends about the\nservice and recruit them into\ncivic causes. (Referral)\nThree months and $1,200 later,\nDavid’s first MVP was in customers’\nhands. In the initial cohorts, 5\npercent signed up for the service and\n17 percent verified their registered\nvoter status (see the chart below).\nThe numbers were so low that there\nwasn’t enough data to tell what sort\nof engagement or referral would\noccur. It was time to start iterating.\nINITIAL MVP\nRegistration 5%\nActivation 17%\nRetention Too low\nReferral Too low\nDavid spent the next two months and\nanother $5,000 split testing new\nproduct features, messaging, and\nimproving the product’s design to\nmake it easier to use. Those tests\nshowed dramatic improvements,\ngoing from a 5 percent registration\nrate to 17 percent and from a 17\npercent activation rate to over 90\npercent. Such is the power of split\ntesting. This optimization gave\nDavid a critical mass of customers\nwith which to measure the next two\nleaps of faith. However, as shown in\nthe chart below, those numbers\nproved to be even more\ndiscouraging: David achieved a\nreferral rate of only 4 percent and a\nretention rate of 5 percent.\nINITIAL MVP AFTER OPTIMIZATION\nRegistration 5% 17%\nActivation 17% 90%\nRetention Too low 5%\nReferral Too low 4%\nDavid knew he had to do more\ndevelopment and testing. For the\nnext three months he continued to\noptimize, split test, and refine his\npitch. He talked to customers, held\nfocus groups, and did countless A/B\nexperiments. As was explained in\nChapter 7, in a split test, different\nversions of a product are offered to\ndifferent customers at the same time.\nBy observing the changes in\nbehavior between the two groups,\none can make inferences about the\nimpact of the different variations. As\nshown in the chart below, the referral\nrate nudged up slightly to 6 percent\nand the retention rate went up to 8\npercent. A disappointed David had\nspent eight months and $20,000 to\nbuild a product that wasn’t living up\nto the growth model he’d hoped for.\nBEFORE OPTIMIZATION AFTER OPTIMIZATION\nRegistration 17% 17%\nActivation 90% 90%\nRetention 5% 8%\nReferral 4% 6%\nDavid faced the difficult challenge\nof deciding whether to pivot or\npersevere. This is one of the hardest\ndecisions entrepreneurs face. The\ngoal of creating learning milestones\nis not to make the decision easy; it is\nto make sure that there is relevant\ndata in the room when it comes time\nto decide.\nRemember, at this point David has\nhad many customer conversations.\nHe has plenty of learning that he can\nuse to rationalize the failure he has\nexperienced with the current product.\nThat’s exactly what many\nentrepreneurs do. In Silicon Valley,\nwe call this experience getting stuck\nin the land of the living dead. It\nhappens when a company has\nachieved a modicum of success—\njust enough to stay alive—but is not\nliving up to the expectations of its\nfounders and investors. Such\ncompanies are a terrible drain of\nhuman energy. Out of loyalty, the\nemployees and founders don’t want\nto give in; they feel that success\nmight be just around the corner.\nDavid had two advantages that\nhelped him avoid this fate:\n1. Despite being committed to a\nsignificant vision, he had\ndone his best to launch early\nand iterate. Thus, he was\nfacing a pivot or persevere\nmoment just eight months\ninto the life of his company.\nThe more money, time, and\ncreative energy that has been\nsunk into an idea, the harder\nit is to pivot. David had done\nwell to avoid that trap.\n2. David had identified his leapof-faith questions explicitly at\nthe outset and, more\nimportant, had made\nquantitative predictions about\neach of them. It would not\nhave been difficult for him to\ndeclare success retroactively\nfrom that initial venture.\nAfter all, some of his metrics,\nsuch as activation, were\ndoing quite well. In terms of\ngross metrics such as total\nusage, the company had\npositive growth. It is only\nbecause David focused on\nactionable metrics for each of\nhis leap-of-faith questions\nthat he was able to accept\nthat his company was failing.\nIn addition, because David\nhad not wasted energy on\npremature PR, he was able to\nmake this determination\nwithout public\nembarrassment or distraction.\nFailure is a prerequisite to\nlearning. The problem with the\nnotion of shipping a product and then\nseeing what happens is that you are\nguaranteed to succeed—at seeing\nwhat happens. But then what? As\nsoon as you have a handful of\ncustomers, you’re likely to have five\nopinions about what to do next.\nWhich should you listen to?\nVotizen’s results were okay, but\nthey were not good enough. David\nfelt that although his optimization\nwas improving the metrics, they\nwere not trending toward a model\nthat would sustain the business\noverall. But like all good\nentrepreneurs, he did not give up\nprematurely. David decided to pivot\nand test a new hypothesis. A pivot\nrequires that we keep one foot rooted\nin what we’ve learned so far, while\nmaking a fundamental change in\nstrategy in order to seek even greater\nvalidated learning. In this case,\nDavid’s direct contact with\ncustomers proved essential.\nHe had heard three recurring bits\nof feedback in his testing:\n1. “I always wanted to get more\ninvolved; this makes it so\nmuch easier.”\n2. “The fact that you prove I’m\na voter matters.”\n3. “There’s no one here. What’s\nthe point of coming back?”1\nDavid decided to undertake what I\ncall a zoom-in pivot, refocusing the\nproduct on what previously had been\nconsidered just one feature of a\nlarger whole. Think of the customer\ncomments above: customers like the\nconcept, they like the voter\nregistration technology, but they\naren’t getting value out of the social\nnetworking part of the product.\nDavid decided to change Votizen\ninto a product called @2gov, a\n“social lobbying platform.” Rather\nthan get customers integrated in a\ncivic social network, @2gov allows\nthem to contact their elected\nrepresentatives quickly and easily\nvia existing social networks such as\nTwitter. The customer engages\ndigitally, but @2gov translates that\ndigital contact into paper form.\nMembers of Congress receive oldfashioned printed letters and\npetitions as a result. In other words,\n@2gov translates the high-tech\nworld of its customers into the lowtech world of politics.\n@2gov had a slightly different set\nof leap-of-faith questions to answer.\nIt still depended on customers\nsigning up, verifying their voter\nstatus, and referring their friends, but\nthe growth model changed. Instead\nof relying on an engagement-driven\nbusiness (“sticky” growth), @2gov\nwas more transactional. David’s\nhypothesis was that passionate\nactivists would be willing to pay\nmoney to have @2gov facilitate\ncontacts on behalf of voters who\ncared about their issues.\nDavid’s new MVP took four\nmonths and another $30,000. He’d\nnow spent a grand total of $50,000\nand worked for twelve months. But\nthe results from his next round of\ntesting were dramatic: registration\nrate 42 percent, activation 83\npercent, retention 21 percent, and\nreferral a whopping 54 percent.\nHowever, the number of activists\nwilling to pay was less than 1\npercent. The value of each\ntransaction was far too low to sustain\na profitable business even after\nDavid had done his best to optimize\nit.\nBefore we get to David’s next\npivot, notice how convincingly he\nwas able to demonstrate validated\nlearning. He hoped that with this\nnew product, he would be able to\nimprove his leap-of-faith metrics\ndramatically, and he did (see the\nchart below).\nBEFORE PIVOT AFTER PIVOT\nEngine of growth Sticky Paid\nRegistration rate 17% 42%\nActivation 90% 83%\nRetention 8% 21%\nReferral 6% 54%\nRevenue n/a 1%\nLifetime value (LTV) n/a Minimal\nHe did this not by working harder\nbut by working smarter, taking his\nproduct development resources and\napplying them to a new and different\nproduct. Compared with the previous\nfour months of optimization, the new\nfour months of pivoting had resulted\nin a dramatically higher return on\ninvestment, but David was still stuck\nin an age-old entrepreneurial trap.\nHis metrics and product were\nimproving, but not fast enough.\nDavid pivoted again. This time,\nrather than rely on activists to pay\nmoney to drive contacts, he went to\nlarge organizations, professional\nfund-raisers, and big companies,\nwhich all have a professional or\nbusiness interest in political\ncampaigning. The companies\nseemed extremely eager to use and\npay for David’s service, and David\nquickly signed letters of intent to\nbuild the functionality they needed.\nIn this pivot, David did what I call a\ncustomer segment pivot, keeping the\nfunctionality of the product the same\nbut changing the audience focus. He\nfocused on who pays: from\nconsumers to businesses and\nnonprofit organizations. In other\nwords, David went from being a\nbusiness-to-consumer (B2C)\ncompany to being a business-tobusiness (B2B) company. In the\nprocess he changed his planned\ngrowth model, as well to one where\nhe would be able to fund growth out\nof the profits generated from each\nB2B sale.\nThree months later, David had\nbuilt the functionality he had\npromised, based on those early\nletters of intent. But when he went\nback to companies to collect his\nchecks, he discovered more\nproblems. Company after company\nprocrastinated, delayed, and\nultimately passed up the opportunity.\nAlthough they had been excited\nenough to sign a letter of intent,\nclosing a real sale was much more\ndifficult. It turned out that those\ncompanies were not early adopters.\nOn the basis of the letters of\nintent, David had increased his head\ncount, taking on additional sales staff\nand engineers in anticipation of\nhaving to service higher-margin\nbusiness-to-business accounts. When\nthe sales didn’t materialize, the\nwhole team had to work harder to try\nto find revenue elsewhere. Yet no\nmatter how many sales calls they\nwent on and no matter how much\noptimization they did to the product,\nthe model wasn’t working. Returning\nto his leap-of-faith questions, David\nconcluded that the results refuted his\nbusiness-to-business hypothesis, and\nso he decided to pivot once again.\nAll this time, David was learning\nand gaining feedback from his\npotential customers, but he was in an\nunsustainable situation. You can’t\npay staff with what you’ve learned,\nand raising money at that juncture\nwould have escalated the problem.\nRaising money without early traction\nis not a certain thing. If he had been\nable to raise money, he could have\nkept the company going but would\nhave been pouring money into a\nvalue-destroying engine of growth.\nHe would be in a high-pressure\nsituation: use investor’s cash to make\nthe engine of growth work or risk\nhaving to shut down the company (or\nbe replaced).\nDavid decided to reduce staff and\npivot again, this time attempting\nwhat I call a platform pivot. Instead\nof selling an application to one\ncustomer at a time, David envisioned\na new growth model inspired by\nGoogle’s AdWords platform. He\nbuilt a self-serve sales platform\nwhere anyone could become a\ncustomer with just a credit card.\nThus, no matter what cause you were\npassionate about, you could go to\n@2gov’s website and @2gov would\nhelp you find new people to get\ninvolved. As always, the new people\nwere verified registered voters, and\nso their opinions carried weight with\nelected officials.\nThe new product took only one\nadditional month to build and\nimmediately showed results: 51\npercent sign-up rate, 92 percent\nactivation rate, 28 percent retention\nrate, 64 percent referral rate (see the\nchart below). Most important, 11\npercent of these customers were\nwilling to pay 20 cents per message.\nMost important, this was the\nbeginning of an actual growth model\nthat could work. Receiving 20 cents\nper message might not sound like\nmuch, but the high referral rate\nmeant that @2gov could grow its\ntraffic without spending significant\nmarketing money (this is the viral\nengine of growth).\nBEFORE PIVOT AFTER PIVOT\nEngine of growth Paid Viral\nRegistration rate 42% 51%\nActivation 83% 92%\nRetention 21% 28%\nReferral 54% 64%\nRevenue 1% 11%\nLifetime value (LTV) Minimal $0.20 per message\nVotizen’s story exhibits some\ncommon patterns. One of the most\nimportant to note is the acceleration\nof MVPs. The first MVP took eight\nmonths, the next four months, then\nthree, then one. Each time David was\nable to validate or refute his next\nhypothesis faster than before.\nHow can one explain this\nacceleration? It is tempting to credit\nit to the product development work\nthat had been going on. Many\nfeatures had been created, and with\nthem a fair amount of infrastructure.\nTherefore, each time the company\npivoted, it didn’t have to start from\nscratch. But this is not the whole\nstory. For one thing, much of the\nproduct had to be discarded between\npivots. Worse, the product that\nremained was classified as a legacy\nproduct, one that was no longer\nsuited to the goals of the company.\nAs is usually the case, the effort\nrequired to reform a legacy product\ntook extra work. Counteracting these\nforces were the hard-won lessons\nDavid had learned through each\nmilestone. Votizen accelerated its\nMVP process because it was\nlearning critical things about its\ncustomers, market, and strategy.\nToday, two years after its\ninception, Votizen is doing well.\nThey recently raised $1.5 million\nfrom Facebook’s initial investor\nPeter Thiel, one of the very few\nconsumer Internet investments he\nhas made in recent years. Votizen’s\nsystem now can process voter\nidentity in real time for forty-seven\nstates representing 94 percent of the\nU.S. population and has delivered\ntens of thousands of messages to\nCongress. The Startup Visa\ncampaign used Votizen’s tools to\nintroduce the Startup Visa Act\n(S.565), which is the first legislation\nintroduced into the Senate solely as a\nresult of social lobbying. These\nactivities have attracted the attention\nof established Washington\nconsultants who are seeking to\nemploy Votizen’s tools in future\npolitical campaigns.\nDavid Binetti sums up his\nexperience building a Lean Startup:\nIn 2003 I started a company in\nroughly the same space as I’m\nin today. I had roughly the same\ndomain expertise and industry\ncredibility, fresh off the\nUSA.gov success. But back\nthen my company was a total\nfailure (despite consuming\nsignificantly greater\ninvestment), while now I have a\nbusiness making money and\nclosing deals. Back then I did\nthe traditional linear product\ndevelopment model, releasing\nan amazing product (it really\nwas) after 12 months of\ndevelopment, only to find that\nno one would buy it. This time I\nproduced four versions in\ntwelve weeks and generated my\nfirst sale relatively soon after\nthat. And it isn’t just market\ntiming—two other companies\nthat launched in a similar space\nin 2003 subsequently sold for\ntens of millions of dollars, and\nothers in 2010 followed a linear\nmodel straight to the dead pool.\nA STARTUP’S RUNWAY IS THE\nNUMBER OF PIVOTS IT CAN\nSTILL MAKE\nSeasoned entrepreneurs often speak\nof the runway that their startup has\nleft: the amount of time remaining in\nwhich a startup must either achieve\nlift-off or fail. This usually is defined\nas the remaining cash in the bank\ndivided by the monthly burn rate, or\nnet drain on that account balance.\nFor example, a startup with $1\nmillion in the bank that is spending\n$100,000 per month has a projected\nrunway of ten months.\nWhen startups start to run low on\ncash, they can extend the runway\ntwo ways: by cutting costs or by\nraising additional funds. But when\nentrepreneurs cut costs\nindiscriminately, they are as liable to\ncut the costs that are allowing the\ncompany to get through its BuildMeasure-Learn feedback loop as\nthey are to cut waste. If the cuts\nresult in a slowdown to this feedback\nloop, all they have accomplished is\nto help the startup go out of business\nmore slowly.\nThe true measure of runway is\nhow many pivots a startup has left:\nthe number of opportunities it has to\nmake a fundamental change to its\nbusiness strategy. Measuring runway\nthrough the lens of pivots rather than\nthat of time suggests another way to\nextend that runway: get to each pivot\nfaster. In other words, the startup has\nto find ways to achieve the same\namount of validated learning at lower\ncost or in a shorter time. All the\ntechniques in the Lean Startup model\nthat have been discussed so far have\nthis as their overarching goal.\nPIVOTS REQUIRE COURAGE\nAsk most entrepreneurs who have\ndecided to pivot and they will tell\nyou that they wish they had made the\ndecision sooner. I believe there are\nthree reasons why this happens.\nFirst, vanity metrics can allow\nentrepreneurs to form false\nconclusions and live in their own\nprivate reality. This is particularly\ndamaging to the decision to pivot\nbecause it robs teams of the belief\nthat it is necessary to change. When\npeople are forced to change against\ntheir better judgment, the process is\nharder, takes longer, and leads to a\nless decisive outcome.\nSecond, when an entrepreneur has\nan unclear hypothesis, it’s almost\nimpossible to experience complete\nfailure, and without failure there is\nusually no impetus to embark on the\nradical change a pivot requires. As I\nmentioned earlier, the failure of the\n“launch it and see what happens”\napproach should now be evident: you\nwill always succeed—in seeing what\nhappens. Except in rare cases, the\nearly results will be ambiguous, and\nyou won’t know whether to pivot or\npersevere, whether to change\ndirection or stay the course.\nThird, many entrepreneurs are\nafraid. Acknowledging failure can\nlead to dangerously low morale.\nMost entrepreneurs’ biggest fear is\nnot that their vision will prove to be\nwrong. More terrifying is the thought\nthat the vision might be deemed\nwrong without having been given a\nreal chance to prove itself. This fear\ndrives much of the resistance to the\nminimum viable product, split\ntesting, and other techniques to test\nhypotheses. Ironically, this fear\ndrives up the risk because testing\ndoesn’t occur until the vision is fully\nrepresented. However, by that time it\nis often too late to pivot because\nfunding is running out. To avoid this\nfate, entrepreneurs need to face their\nfears and be willing to fail, often in a\npublic way. In fact, entrepreneurs\nwho have a high profile, either\nbecause of personal fame or because\nthey are operating as part of a\nfamous brand, face an extreme\nversion of this problem.\nA new startup in Silicon Valley\ncalled Path was started by\nexperienced entrepreneurs: Dave\nMorin, who previously had overseen\nFacebook’s platform initiative;\nDustin Mierau, product designer and\ncocreator of Macster; and Shawn\nFanning of Napster fame. They\ndecided to release a minimum viable\nproduct in 2010. Because of the\nhigh-profile nature of its founders,\nthe MVP attracted significant press\nattention, especially from technology\nand startup blogs. Unfortunately,\ntheir product was not targeted at\ntechnology early adopters, and as a\nresult, the early blogger reaction was\nquite negative. (Many entrepreneurs\nfail to launch because they are afraid\nof this kind of reaction, worrying that\nit will harm the morale of the entire\ncompany. The allure of positive\npress, especially in our “home”\nindustry, is quite strong.)\nLuckily, the Path team had the\ncourage to ignore this fear and focus\non what their customers said. As a\nresult, they were able to get essential\nearly feedback from actual\ncustomers. Path’s goal is to create a\nmore personal social network that\nmaintains its quality over time. Many\npeople have had the experience of\nbeing overconnected on existing\nsocial networks, sharing with past\ncoworkers, high school friends,\nrelatives, and colleagues. Such broad\ngroups make it hard to share intimate\nmoments. Path took an unusual\napproach. For example, it limited the\nnumber of connections to fifty, based\non brain research by the\nanthropologist Robin Dunbar at\nOxford. His research suggests that\nfifty is roughly the number of\npersonal relationships in any\nperson’s life at any given time.\nFor members of the tech press\n(and many tech early adopters) this\n“artificial” constraint on the number\nof connections was anathema. They\nroutinely use new social networking\nproducts with thousands of\nconnections. Fifty seemed way too\nsmall. As a result, Path endured a lot\nof public criticism, which was hard\nto ignore. But customers flocked to\nthe platform, and their feedback was\ndecidedly different from the\nnegativity in the press. Customers\nliked the intimate moments and\nconsistently wanted features that\nwere not on the original product road\nmap, such as the ability to share how\nfriends’ pictures made them feel and\nthe ability to share “video moments.”\nDave Morin summed up his\nexperience this way:\nThe reality of our team and our\nbackgrounds built up a massive\nwall of expectations. I don’t\nthink it would have mattered\nwhat we would have released;\nwe would have been met with\nexpectations that are hard to\nlive up to. But to us it just\nmeant we needed to get our\nproduct and our vision out into\nthe market broadly in order to\nget feedback and to begin\niteration. We humbly test our\ntheories and our approach to see\nwhat the market thinks. Listen\nto feedback honestly. And\ncontinue to innovate in the\ndirections we think will create\nmeaning in the world.\nPath’s story is just beginning, but\nalready their courage in facing down\ncritics is paying off. If and when they\nneed to pivot, they won’t be\nhampered by fear. They recently\nraised $8.5 million in venture capital\nin a round led by Kleiner Perkins\nCaufield & Byers. In doing so, Path\nreportedly turned down an\nacquisition offer for $100 million\nfrom Google.2\nTHE PIVOT OR PERSEVERE\nMEETING\nThe decision to pivot requires a\nclear-eyed and objective mind-set.\nWe’ve discussed the telltale signs of\nthe need to pivot: the decreasing\neffectiveness of product experiments\nand the general feeling that product\ndevelopment should be more\nproductive. Whenever you see those\nsymptoms, consider a pivot.\nThe decision to pivot is\nemotionally charged for any startup\nand has to be addressed in a\nstructured way. One way to mitigate\nthis challenge is to schedule the\nmeeting in advance. I recommend\nthat every startup have a regular\n“pivot or persevere” meeting. In my\nexperience, less than a few weeks\nbetween meetings is too often and\nmore than a few months is too\ninfrequent. However, each startup\nneeds to find its own pace.\nEach pivot or persevere meeting\nrequires the participation of both the\nproduct development and business\nleadership teams. At IMVU, we also\nadded the perspectives of outside\nadvisers who could help us see past\nour preconceptions and interpret data\nin new ways. The product\ndevelopment team must bring a\ncomplete report of the results of its\nproduct optimization efforts over\ntime (not just the past period) as well\nas a comparison of how those results\nstack up against expectations (again,\nover time). The business leadership\nshould bring detailed accounts of\ntheir conversations with current and\npotential customers.\nLet’s take a look at this process in\naction in a dramatic pivot done by a\ncompany called Wealthfront. That\ncompany was founded in 2007 by\nDan Carroll and added Andy\nRachleff as CEO shortly thereafter.\nAndy is a well-known figure in\nSilicon Valley: he is a cofounder and\nformer general partner of the venture\ncapital firm Benchmark Capital and\nis on the faculty of the Stanford\nGraduate School of Business, where\nhe teaches a variety of courses on\ntechnology entrepreneurship. I first\nmet Andy when he commissioned a\ncase study on IMVU to teach his\nstudents about the process we had\nused to build the company.\nWealthfront’s mission is to disrupt\nthe mutual fund industry by bringing\ngreater transparency, access, and\nvalue to retail investors. What makes\nWealthfront’s story unusual,\nhowever, is not where it is today but\nhow it began: as an online game.\nIn Wealthfront’s original\nincarnation it was called kaChing\nand was conceived as a kind of\nfantasy league for amateur investors.\nIt allowed anyone to open a virtual\ntrading account and build a portfolio\nthat was based on real market data\nwithout having to invest real money.\nThe idea was to identify diamonds in\nthe rough: amateur traders who\nlacked the resources to become fund\nmanagers but who possessed market\ninsight. Wealthfront’s founders did\nnot want to be in the online gaming\nbusiness per se; kaChing was part of\na sophisticated strategy in the service\nof their larger vision. Any student of\ndisruptive innovation would have\nlooked on approvingly: they were\nfollowing that system perfectly by\ninitially serving customers who were\nunable to participate in the\nmainstream market. Over time, they\nbelieved, the product would become\nmore and more sophisticated,\neventually allowing users to serve\n(and disrupt) existing professional\nfund managers.\nTo identify the best amateur\ntrading savants, Wealthfront built\nsophisticated technology to rate the\nskill of each fund manager, using\ntechniques employed by the most\nsophisticated evaluators of money\nmanagers, the premier U.S.\nuniversity endowments. Those\nmethods allowed them to evaluate\nnot just the returns the managers\ngenerated but also the amount of risk\nthey had taken along with how\nconsistent they performed relative to\ntheir declared investment strategy.\nThus, fund managers who achieved\ngreat returns through reckless\ngambles (i.e., investments outside\ntheir area of expertise) would be\nranked lower than those who had\nfigured out how to beat the market\nthrough skill.\nWith its kaChing game,\nWealthfront hoped to test two leapof-faith assumptions:\n1. A significant percentage of\nthe game players would\ndemonstrate enough talent as\nvirtual fund managers to\nprove themselves suitable to\nbecome managers of real\nassets (the value hypothesis).\n2. The game would grow using\nthe viral engine of growth\nand generate value using a\nfreemium business model.\nThe game was free to play,\nbut the team hoped that a\npercentage of the players\nwould realize that they were\nlousy traders and therefore\nwant to convert to paying\ncustomers once Wealthfront\nstarted offering real asset\nmanagement services (the\ngrowth hypothesis).\nkaChing was a huge early success,\nattracting more than 450,000 gamers\nin its initial launch. By now, you\nshould be suspicious of this kind of\nvanity metric. Many less disciplined\ncompanies would have celebrated\nthat success and felt their future was\nsecure, but Wealthfront had\nidentified its assumptions clearly and\nwas able to think more rigorously.\nBy the time Wealthfront was ready\nto launch its paid financial product,\nonly seven amateur managers had\nqualified as worthy of managing\nother people’s money, far less than\nthe ideal model had anticipated.\nAfter the paid product launched, they\nwere able to measure the conversion\nrate of gamers into paying\ncustomers. Here too the numbers\nwere discouraging: the conversion\nrate was close to zero. Their model\nhad predicted that hundreds of\ncustomers would sign up, but only\nfourteen did.\nThe team worked valiantly to find\nways to improve the product, but\nnone showed any particular promise.\nIt was time for a pivot or persevere\nmeeting.\nIf the data we have discussed so\nfar was all that was available at that\ncritical meeting, Wealthfront would\nhave been in trouble. They would\nhave known that their current\nstrategy wasn’t working but not what\nto do to fix it. That is why it was\ncritical that they followed the\nrecommendation earlier in this\nchapter to investigate alternative\npossibilities. In this case,\nWealthfront had pursued two\nimportant lines of inquiry.\nThe first was a series of\nconversations with professional\nmoney managers, beginning with\nJohn Powers, the head of Stanford\nUniversity’s endowment, who\nreacted surprisingly positively.\nWealthfront’s strategy was premised\non the assumption that professional\nmoney managers would be reluctant\nto join the system because the\nincreased transparency would\nthreaten their sense of authority.\nPowers had no such concerns. CEO\nAndy Rachleff then began a series of\nconversations with other professional\ninvestment managers and brought the\nresults back to the company. His\ninsights were as follows:\n1. Successful professional\nmoney managers felt they\nhad nothing to fear from\ntransparency, since they\nbelieved it would validate\ntheir skills.\n2. Money managers faced\nsignificant challenges in\nmanaging and scaling their\nown businesses. They were\nhampered by the difficulty of\nservicing their own accounts\nand therefore had to require\nhigh minimum investments\nas a way to screen new\nclients.\nThe second problem was so severe\nthat Wealthfront was fielding cold\ncalls from professional managers\nasking out of the blue to join the\nplatform. These were classic early\nadopters who had the vision to see\npast the current product to something\nthey could use to achieve a\ncompetitive advantage.\nThe second critical qualitative\ninformation came out of\nconversations with consumers. It\nturned out that they found the\nblending of virtual and real portfolio\nmanagement on the kaChing website\nconfusing. Far from being a clever\nway of acquiring customers, the\nfreemium strategy was getting in the\nway by promoting confusion about\nthe company’s positioning.\nThis data informed the pivot or\npersevere meeting. With everyone\npresent, the team debated what to do\nwith its future. The current strategy\nwasn’t working, but many\nemployees were nervous about\nabandoning the online game. After\nall, it was an important part of what\nthey had signed on to build. They\nhad invested significant time and\nenergy building and supporting those\ncustomers. It was painful—as it\nalways is—to realize that that energy\nhad been wasted.\nWealthfront decided it could not\npersevere as it existed. The company\nchose instead to celebrate what it had\nlearned. If it had not launched its\ncurrent product, the team never\nwould have learned what it needed to\nknow to pivot. In fact, the experience\ntaught them something essential\nabout their vision. As Andy says,\n“What we really wanted to change\nwas not who manages the money but\nwho has access to the best possible\ntalent. We’d originally thought we’d\nneed to build a significant business\nwith amateur managers to get\nprofessionals to come on board, but\nfortunately it turns out that wasn’t\nnecessary.”\nThe company pivoted, abandoning\nthe gaming customers altogether and\nfocusing on providing a service that\nallowed customers to invest with\nprofessional managers. On the\nsurface, the pivot seems quite\ndramatic in that the company\nchanged its positioning, its name,\nand its partner strategy. It even\njettisoned a large proportion of the\nfeatures it had built. But at its core, a\nsurprising amount stayed the same.\nThe most valuable work the\ncompany had done was building\ntechnology to evaluate managers’\neffectiveness, and this became the\nkernel around which the new\nbusiness was built. This is also\ncommon with pivots; it is not\nnecessary to throw out everything\nthat came before and start over.\nInstead, it’s about repurposing what\nhas been built and what has been\nlearned to find a more positive\ndirection.\nToday, Wealthfront is prospering\nas a result of its pivot, with over\n$180 million invested on the\nplatform and more than forty\nprofessional managers.3 It recently\nwas named one of Fast Company’s\nten most innovative companies in\nfinance.4 The company continues to\noperate with agility, scaling in line\nwith the growth principles outlined\nin Chapter 12. Wealthfront is also a\nleading advocate of the development\ntechnique known as continuous\ndeployment, which we’ll discuss in\nChapter 9.\nFAILURE TO PIVOT\nThe decision to pivot is so difficult\nthat many companies fail to make it.\nI wish I could say that every time I\nwas confronted with the need to\npivot, I handled it well, but this is far\nfrom true. I remember one failure to\npivot especially well.\nA few years after IMVU’s\nfounding, the company was having\ntremendous success. The business\nhad grown to over $1 million per\nmonth in revenue; we had created\nmore than twenty million avatars for\nour customers. We managed to raise\nsignificant new rounds of financing,\nand like the global economy, we\nwere riding high. But danger lurked\naround the corner.\nUnknowingly, we had fallen into a\nclassic startup trap. We had been so\nsuccessful with our early efforts that\nwe were ignoring the principles\nbehind them. As a result, we missed\nthe need to pivot even as it stared us\nin the face.\nWe had built an organization that\nexcelled at the kinds of activities\ndescribed in earlier chapters: creating\nminimum viable products to test new\nideas and running experiments to\ntune the engine of growth. Before we\nhad begun to enjoy success, many\npeople had advised against our “lowquality” minimum viable product\nand experimental approach, urging\nus to slow down. They wanted us to\ndo things right and focus on quality\ninstead of speed. We ignored that\nadvice, mostly because we wanted to\nclaim the advantages of speed. After\nour approach was vindicated, the\nadvice we received changed. Now\nmost of the advice we heard was that\n“you can’t argue with success,”\nurging us to stay the course. We\nliked this advice better, but it was\nequally wrong.\nRemember that the rationale for\nbuilding low-quality MVPs is that\ndeveloping any features beyond what\nearly adopters require is a form of\nwaste. However, the logic of this\ntakes you only so far. Once you have\nfound success with early adopters,\nyou want to sell to mainstream\ncustomers. Mainstream customers\nhave different requirements and are\nmuch more demanding.\nThe kind of pivot we needed is\ncalled a customer segment pivot. In\nthis pivot, the company realizes that\nthe product it’s building solves a real\nproblem for real customers but that\nthey are not the customers it\noriginally planned to serve. In other\nwords, the product hypothesis is\nconfirmed only partially. (This\nchapter described such a pivot in the\nVotizen story, above.)\nA customer segment pivot is an\nespecially tricky pivot to execute\nbecause, as we learned the hard way\nat IMVU, the very actions that made\nus successful with early adopters\nwere diametrically opposed to the\nactions we’d have to master to be\nsuccessful with mainstream\ncustomers. We lacked a clear\nunderstanding of how our engine of\ngrowth operated. We had begun to\ntrust our vanity metrics. We had\nstopped using learning milestones to\nhold ourselves accountable. Instead,\nit was much more convenient to\nfocus on the ever-larger gross\nmetrics that were so exciting:\nbreaking new records in signing up\npaying customers and active users,\nmonitoring our customer retention\nrate—you name it. Under the\nsurface, it should have been clear\nthat our efforts at tuning the engine\nwere reaching diminishing returns,\nthe classic sign of the need to pivot.\nFor example, we spent months\ntrying to improve the product’s\nactivation rate (the rate at which new\ncustomers become active consumers\nof the product), which remained\nstubbornly low. We did countless\nexperiments: usability\nimprovements, new persuasion\ntechniques, incentive programs,\ncustomer quests, and other game-like\nfeatures. Individually, many of these\nnew features and new marketing\ntools were successful. We measured\nthem rigorously, using A/B\nexperimentation. But taken in\naggregate, over the course of many\nmonths, we were seeing negligible\nchanges in the overall drivers of our\nengine of growth. Even our\nactivation rate, which had been the\ncenter of our focus, edged up only a\nfew percentage points.\nWe ignored the signs because the\ncompany was still growing,\ndelivering month after month of “up\nand to the right” results. But we were\nquickly exhausting our early adopter\nmarket. It was getting harder and\nharder to find customers we could\nacquire at the prices we were\naccustomed to paying. As we drove\nour marketing team to find more\ncustomers, they were forced to reach\nout more to mainstream customers,\nbut mainstream customers are less\nforgiving of an early product. The\nactivation and monetization rates of\nnew customers started to go down,\ndriving up the cost of acquiring new\ncustomers. Pretty soon, our growth\nwas flatlining and our engine\nsputtered and stalled.\nIt took us far too long to make the\nchanges necessary to fix this\nsituation. As with all pivots, we had\nto get back to basics and start the\ninnovation accounting cycle over. It\nfelt like the company’s second\nfounding. We had gotten really good\nat optimizing, tuning, and iterating,\nbut in the process we had lost sight\nof the purpose of those activities:\ntesting a clear hypothesis in the\nservice of the company’s vision.\nInstead, we were chasing growth,\nrevenue, and profits wherever we\ncould find them.\nWe needed to reacquaint ourselves\nwith our new mainstream customers.\nOur interaction designers led the way\nby developing a clear customer\narchetype that was based on\nextensive in-person conversations\nand observation. Next, we needed to\ninvest heavily in a major product\noverhaul designed to make the\nproduct dramatically easier to use.\nBecause of our overfocus on finetuning, we had stopped making large\ninvestments like these, preferring to\ninvest in lower-risk and lower-yield\ntesting experiments.\nHowever, investing in quality,\ndesign, and larger projects did not\nrequire that we abandon our\nexperimental roots. On the contrary,\nonce we realized our mistake and\nexecuted the pivot, those skills\nserved us well. We created a\nsandbox for experimentation like the\none described in Chapter 12 and had\na cross-functional team work\nexclusively on this major redesign.\nAs they built, they continuously\ntested their new design head to head\nagainst the old one. Initially, the new\ndesign performed worse than the old\none, as is usually the case. It lacked\nthe features and functionality of the\nold design and had many new\nmistakes as well. But the team\nrelentlessly improved the design\nuntil, months later, it performed\nbetter. This new design laid the\nfoundation for our future growth.\nThis foundation has paid off\nhandsomely. By 2009, revenue had\nmore than doubled to over $25\nmillion annually. But we might have\nenjoyed that success earlier if we had\npivoted sooner.5\nA CATALOG OF PIVOTS\nPivots come in different flavors. The\nw o r d pivot sometimes is used\nincorrectly as a synonym for change.\nA pivot is a special kind of change\ndesigned to test a new fundamental\nhypothesis about the product,\nbusiness model, and engine of\ngrowth.\nZoom-in Pivot\nIn this case, what previously was\nconsidered a single feature in a\nproduct becomes the whole product.\nThis is the type of pivot Votizen\nmade when it pivoted away from a\nfull social network and toward a\nsimple voter contact product.\nZoom-out Pivot\nIn the reverse situation, sometimes a\nsingle feature is insufficient to\nsupport a whole product. In this type\nof pivot, what was considered the\nwhole product becomes a single\nfeature of a much larger product.\nCustomer Segment Pivot\nIn this pivot, the company realizes\nthat the product it is building solves\na real problem for real customers but\nthat they are not the type of\ncustomers it originally planned to\nserve. In other words, the product\nhypothesis is partially confirmed,\nsolving the right problem, but for a\ndifferent customer than originally\nanticipated.\nCustomer Need Pivot\nAs a result of getting to know\ncustomers extremely well, it\nsometimes becomes clear that the\nproblem we’re trying to solve for\nthem is not very important. However,\nbecause of this customer intimacy,\nwe often discover other related\nproblems that are important and can\nbe solved by our team. In many\ncases, these related problems may\nrequire little more than repositioning\nthe existing product. In other cases, it\nmay require a completely new\nproduct. Again, this a case where the\nproduct hypothesis is partially\nconfirmed; the target customer has a\nproblem worth solving, just not the\none that was originally anticipated.\nA famous example is the chain\nPotbelly Sandwich Shop, which\ntoday has over two hundred stores. It\nbegan as an antique store in 1977;\nthe owners started to sell sandwiches\nas a way to bolster traffic to their\nstores. Pretty soon they had pivoted\ntheir way into an entirely different\nline of business.\nPlatform Pivot\nA platform pivot refers to a change\nfrom an application to a platform or\nvice versa. Most commonly, startups\nthat aspire to create a new platform\nbegin life by selling a single\napplication, the so-called killer app,\nfor their platform. Only later does the\nplatform emerge as a vehicle for\nthird parties to leverage as a way to\ncreate their own related products.\nHowever, this order is not always set\nin stone, and some companies have\nto execute this pivot multiple times.\nBusiness Architecture Pivot\nThis pivot borrows a concept from\nGeoffrey Moore, who observed that\ncompanies generally follow one of\ntwo major business architectures:\nhigh margin, low volume (complex\nsystems model) or low margin, high\nvolume (volume operations model).6\nThe former commonly is associated\nwith business to business (B2B) or\nenterprise sales cycles, and the latter\nwith consumer products (there are\nnotable exceptions). In a business\narchitecture pivot, a startup switches\narchitectures. Some companies\nchange from high margin, low\nvolume by going mass market (e.g.,\nGoogle’s search “appliance”);\nothers, originally designed for the\nmass market, turned out to require\nlong and expensive sales cycles.\nValue Capture Pivot\nThere are many ways to capture the\nvalue a company creates. These\nmethods are referred to commonly as\nmonetization or revenue models.\nThese terms are much too limiting.\nImplicit in the idea of monetization\nis that it is a separate “feature” of a\nproduct that can be added or\nremoved at will. In reality, capturing\nvalue is an intrinsic part of the\nproduct hypothesis. Often, changes\nto the way a company captures value\ncan have far-reaching consequences\nfor the rest of the business, product,\nand marketing strategies.\nEngine of Growth Pivot\nAs we’ll see in Chapter 10, there are\nthree primary engines of growth that\npower startups: the viral, sticky, and\npaid growth models. In this type of\npivot, a company changes its growth\nstrategy to seek faster or more\nprofitable growth. Commonly but not\nalways, the engine of growth also\nrequires a change in the way value is\ncaptured.\nChannel Pivot\nIn traditional sales terminology, the\nmechanism by which a company\ndelivers its product to customers is\ncalled the sales channel or\ndistribution channel. For example,\nconsumer packaged goods are sold in\na grocery store, cars are sold in\ndealerships, and much enterprise\nsoftware is sold (with extensive\ncustomization) by consulting and\nprofessional services firms. Often,\nthe requirements of the channel\ndetermine the price, features, and\ncompetitive landscape of a product.\nA channel pivot is a recognition that\nthe same basic solution could be\ndelivered through a different channel\nwith greater effectiveness. Whenever\na company abandons a previously\ncomplex sales process to “sell\ndirect” to its end users, a channel\npivot is in progress.\nIt is precisely because of its\ndestructive effect on sales channels\nthat the Internet has had such a\ndisruptive influence in industries that\npreviously required complex sales\nand distribution channels, such as\nnewspaper, magazine, and book\npublishing.\nTechnology Pivot\nOccasionally, a company discovers a\nway to achieve the same solution by\nusing a completely different\ntechnology. Technology pivots are\nmuch more common in established\nbusinesses. In other words, they are a\nsustaining innovation, an incremental\nimprovement designed to appeal to\nand retain an existing customer base.\nEstablished companies excel at this\nkind of pivot because so much is not\nchanging. The customer segment is\nthe same, the customer’s problem is\nthe same, the value-capture model is\nthe same, and the channel partners\nare the same. The only question is\nwhether the new technology can\nprovide superior price and/or\nperformance compared with the\nexisting technology.\nA PIVOT IS A STRATEGIC\nHYPOTHESIS\nAlthough the pivots identified above\nwill be familiar to students of\nbusiness strategy, the ability to pivot\nis no substitute for sound strategic\nthinking. The problem with\nproviding famous examples of pivots\nis that most people are familiar only\nwith the successful end strategies of\nfamous companies. Most readers\nknow that Southwest or Walmart is\nan example of a low-cost disruption\nin their markets, that Microsoft an\nexample of a platform monopoly,\nand that Starbucks has leveraged a\npowerful premium brand. What is\ngenerally less well known are the\npivots that were required to discover\nthose strategies. Companies have a\nstrong incentive to align their PR\nstories around the heroic founder and\nmake it seem that their success was\nthe inevitable result of a good idea.\nThus, although startups often pivot\ninto a strategy that seems similar to\nthat of a successful company, it is\nimportant not to put too much stock\nin these analogies. It’s extremely\ndifficult to know if the analogy has\nbeen drawn properly. Have we\ncopied the essential features or just\nsuperficial ones? Will what worked\nin that industry work in ours? Will\nwhat has worked in the past work\ntoday? A pivot is better understood\nas a new strategic hypothesis that\nwill require a new minimum viable\nproduct to test.\nPivots are a permanent fact of life\nfor any growing business. Even after\na company achieves initial success, it\nmust continue to pivot. Those\nfamiliar with the technology life\ncycle ideas of theorists such as\nGeoffrey Moore know certain later-\nstage pivots by the names he has\ngiven them: the Chasm, the Tornado,\nthe Bowling Alley. Readers of the\ndisruptive innovation literature\nspearheaded by Harvard’s Clayton\nChristensen will be familiar with\nestablished companies that fail to\npivot when they should. The critical\nskill for managers today is to match\nthose theories to their present\nsituation so that they apply the right\nadvice at the right time.\nModern managers cannot have\nescaped the deluge of recent books\ncalling on them to adapt, change,\nreinvent, or upend their existing\nbusinesses. Many of the works in\nthis category are long on\nexhortations and short on specifics.\nA pivot is not just an exhortation\nto change. Remember, it is a special\nkind of structured change designed\nto test a new fundamental hypothesis\nabout the product, business model,\nand engine of growth. It is the heart\nof the Lean Startup method. It is\nwhat makes the companies that\nfollow Lean Startup resilient in the\nface of mistakes: if we take a wrong\nturn, we have the tools we need to\nrealize it and the agility to find\nanother path.\nI n Part Two, we have looked at a\nstartup idea from its initial leaps of\nfaith, tested it with a minimum viable\nproduct, used innovation accounting\nand actionable metrics to evaluate\nthe results, and made the decision to\npivot or persevere.\nI have treated these subjects in\ngreat detail to prepare for what\ncomes next. On the page, these\nprocesses may seem clinical, slow,\nand simple. In the real world,\nsomething different is needed. We\nhave learned to steer when moving\nslowly. Now we must learn to race.\nLaying a solid foundation is only the\nfirst step toward our real destination:\nacceleration.\nPart Three\nACCELERATE\nStart Your Engines\nMost of the decisions startups face\nare not clear-cut. How often should\nyou release a product? Is there a\nreason to release weekly rather than\ndaily or quarterly or annually?\nProduct releases incur overhead, and\nso from an efficiency point of view,\nreleasing often leaves less time to\ndevote to building the product.\nHowever, waiting too long to release\ncan lead to the ultimate waste:\nmaking something that nobody\nwants.\nHow much time and energy\nshould companies invest in\ninfrastructure and planning early on\nin anticipation of success? Spend too\nmuch and you waste precious time\nthat could have been spent learning.\nSpend too little and you may fail to\ntake advantage of early success and\ncede market leadership to a fast\nfollower.\nWhat should employees spend\ntheir days doing? How do we hold\npeople accountable for learning at an\norganizational level? Traditional\ndepartments create incentive\nstructures that keep people focused\non excellence in their specialties:\nmarketing, sales, product\ndevelopment. But what if the\ncompany’s best interests are served\nby cross-functional collaboration?\nStartups need organizational\nstructures that combat the extreme\nuncertainty that is a startup’s chief\nenemy.\nThe lean manufacturing movement\nfaced similar questions on the\nfactory floor. Their answers are\nrelevant for startups as well, with\nsome modifications.\nThe critical first question for any\nlean transformation is: which\nactivities create value and which are\na form of waste? Once you\nunderstand this distinction, you can\nbegin using lean techniques to drive\nout waste and increase the efficiency\nof the value-creating activities. For\nthese techniques to be used in a\nstartup, they must be adapted to the\nunique circumstances of\nentrepreneurship. Recall from\nChapter 3 that value in a startup is\nnot the creation of stuff, but rather\nvalidated learning about how to build\na sustainable business. What\nproducts do customers really want?\nHow will our business grow? Who is\nour customer? Which customers\nshould we listen to and which should\nwe ignore? These are the questions\nthat need answering as quickly as\npossible to maximize a startup’s\nchances of success. That is what\ncreates value for a startup.\nI n Part Three, we will develop\ntechniques that allow Lean Startups\nto grow without sacrificing the speed\nand agility that are the lifeblood of\nevery startup. Contrary to common\nbelief, lethargy and bureaucracy are\nnot the inevitable fate of companies\nas they achieve maturity. I believe\nthat with the proper foundation, Lean\nStartups can grow to become lean\nenterprises that maintain their agility,\nlearning orientation, and culture of\ninnovation even as they scale.\nI n Chapter 9, we will see how\nLean Startups take advantage of the\ncounterintuitive power of small\nbatches. Just as lean manufacturing\nhas pursued a just-in-time approach\nto building products, reducing the\nneed for in-process inventory, Lean\nStartups practice just-in-time\nscalability, conducting product\nexperiments without making massive\nup-front investments in planning and\ndesign.\nChapter 10 will explore the\nmetrics startups should use to\nunderstand their growth as they add\nnew customers and discover new\nmarkets. Sustainable growth follows\none of three engines of growth: paid,\nviral, or sticky. By identifying which\nengine of growth a startup is using, it\ncan then direct energy where it will\nbe most effective in growing the\nbusiness. Each engine requires a\nfocus on unique metrics to evaluate\nthe success of new products and\nprioritize new experiments. When\nused with the innovation accounting\nmethod described in Part Two, these\nmetrics allow startups to figure out\nwhen their growth is at risk of\nrunning out and pivot accordingly.\nChapter 11 shows how to build an\nadaptive organization by investing in\nthe right amount of process to keep\nteams nimble as they grow. We will\nsee how techniques from the tool kit\nof lean manufacturing, such as the\nFive Whys, help startup teams grow\nwithout becoming bureaucratic or\ndysfunctional. We also will see how\nlean disciplines set the stage for a\nstartup to transition into an\nestablished company driven by\noperational excellence.\nI n Chapter 12, we’ll come full\ncircle. As startups grow into\nestablished companies, they face the\nsame pressures that make it\nnecessary for today’s enterprises to\nfind new ways to invest in disruptive\ninnovation. In fact, we’ll see that an\nadvantage of a successful startup’s\nrapid growth is that the company can\nkeep its entrepreneurial DNA even\nas it matures. Today’s companies\nmust learn to master a management\nportfolio of sustainable and\ndisruptive innovation. It is an\nobsolete view that sees startups as\ngoing through discrete phases that\nleave earlier kinds of work—such as\ninnovation—behind. Rather, modern\ncompanies must excel at doing\nmultiple kinds of work in parallel. To\ndo so, we’ll explore techniques for\nincubating innovation teams within\nthe context of an established\ncompany.\nI have included an epilogue called\n“Waste Not” in which I consider\nsome of the broader implications of\nthe success of the Lean Startup\nmovement, place it in historical\ncontext (including cautionary lessons\nfrom past movements), and make\nsuggestions for its future direction.\n9\nBATCH\nIn the book Lean Thinking, James\nWomack and Daniel Jones recount a\nstory of stuffing newsletters into\nenvelopes with the assistance of one\nof the author’s two young children.\nEvery envelope had to be addressed,\nstamped, filled with a letter, and\nsealed. The daughters, age six and\nnine, knew how they should go about\ncompleting the project: “Daddy, first\nyou should fold all of the\nnewsletters. Then you should attach\nthe seal. Then you should put on the\nstamps.” Their father wanted to do it\nthe counterintuitive way: complete\neach envelope one at a time. They—\nlike most of us—thought that was\nbackward, explaining to him “that\nwouldn’t be efficient!” He and his\ndaughters each took half the\nenvelopes and competed to see who\nwould finish first.\nThe father won the race, and not\njust because he is an adult. It\nhappened because the one envelope\nat a time approach is a faster way of\ngetting the job done even though it\nseems inefficient. This has been\nconfirmed in many studies, including\none that was recorded on video.1\nThe one envelope at a time\napproach is called “single-piece\nflow” in lean manufacturing. It\nworks because of the surprising\npower of small batches. When we do\nwork that proceeds in stages, the\n“batch size” refers to how much\nwork moves from one stage to the\nnext at a time. For example, if we\nwere stuffing one hundred\nenvelopes, the intuitive way to do it\n—folding one hundred letters at a\ntime—would have a batch size of\none hundred. Single-piece flow is so\nnamed because it has a batch size of\none.\nWhy does stuffing one envelope at\na time get the job done faster even\nthough it seems like it would be\nslower? Because our intuition\ndoesn’t take into account the extra\ntime required to sort, stack, and\nmove around the large piles of halfcomplete envelopes when it’s done\nthe other way.2 It seems more\nefficient to repeat the same task over\nand over, in part because we expect\nthat we will get better at this simple\ntask the more we do it.\nUnfortunately, in process-oriented\nwork like this, individual\nperformance is not nearly as\nimportant as the overall performance\nof the system.\nEven if the amount of time that\neach process took was exactly the\nsame, the small batch production\napproach still would be superior, and\nfor even more counterintuitive\nreasons. For example, imagine that\nthe letters didn’t fit in the envelopes.\nWith the large-batch approach, we\nwouldn’t find that out until nearly the\nend. With small batches, we’d know\nalmost immediately. What if the\nenvelopes are defective and won’t\nseal? In the large-batch approach,\nwe’d have to unstuff all the\nenvelopes, get new ones, and restuff\nthem. In the small-batch approach,\nwe’d find this out immediately and\nhave no rework required.\nAll these issues are visible in a\nprocess as simple as stuffing\nenvelopes, but they are of real and\nmuch greater consequence in the\nwork of every company, large or\nsmall. The small-batch approach\nproduces a finished product every\nfew seconds, whereas the large-batch\napproach must deliver all the\nproducts at once, at the end. Imagine\nwhat this might look like if the time\nhorizon was hours, days, or weeks.\nWhat if it turns out that the\ncustomers have decided they don’t\nwant the product? Which process\nwould allow a company to find this\nout sooner?\nLean manufacturers discovered\nthe benefits of small batches decades\nago. In the post–World War II\neconomy, Japanese carmakers such\nas Toyota could not compete with\nhuge American factories that used\nthe latest mass production\ntechniques. Following the intuitively\nefficient way of building, mass\nproduction factories built cars by\nusing ever-larger batch sizes. They\nwould spend huge amounts of money\nbuying machines that could produce\ncar parts by the tens, hundreds, or\nthousands. By keeping those\nmachines running at peak speed,\nthey could drive down the unit cost\nof each part and produce cars that\nwere incredibly inexpensive so long\nas they were completely uniform.\nThe Japanese car market was far\ntoo small for companies such as\nToyota to employ those economies\nof scale; thus, Japanese companies\nfaced intense pressure from mass\nproduction. Also, in the war-ravaged\nJapanese economy, capital was not\navailable for massive investments in\nlarge machines.\nIt was against this backdrop that\ninnovators such as Taiichi Ohno,\nShigeo Shingo, and others found a\nway to succeed by using small\nbatches. Instead of buying large\nspecialized machines that could\nproduce thousands of parts at a time,\nToyota used smaller general-purpose\nmachines that could produce a wide\nvariety of parts in small batches.\nThis required figuring out ways to\nreconfigure each machine rapidly to\nmake the right part at the right time.\nBy focusing on this “changeover\ntime,” Toyota was able to produce\nentire automobiles by using small\nbatches throughout the process.\nThis rapid changing of machines\nwas no easy feat. As in any lean\ntransformation, existing systems and\ntools often need to be reinvented to\nsupport working in smaller batches.\nShigeo Shingo created the concept of\nSMED (Single-Minute Exchange of\nDie) in order to enable a smaller\nbatch size of work in early Toyota\nfactories. He was so relentless in\nrethinking the way machines were\noperated that he was able to reduce\nchangeover times that previously\ntook hours to less than ten minutes.\nHe did this, not by asking workers to\nwork faster, but by reimagining and\nrestructuring the work that needed to\nbe done. Every investment in better\ntools and process had a\ncorresponding benefit in terms of\nshrinking the batch size of work.\nBecause of its smaller batch size,\nToyota was able to produce a much\ngreater diversity of products. It was\nno longer necessary that each\nproduct be exactly the same to gain\nthe economies of scale that powered\nmass production. Thus, Toyota could\nserve its smaller, more fragmented\nmarkets and still compete with the\nmass producers. Over time, that\ncapability allowed Toyota to move\nsuccessfully into larger and larger\nmarkets until it became the world’s\nlargest automaker in 2008.\nThe biggest advantage of working\nin small batches is that quality\nproblems can be identified much\nsooner. This is the origin of Toyota’s\nfamous andon cord, which allows\nany worker to ask for help as soon as\nthey notice any problem, such as a\ndefect in a physical part, stopping the\nentire production line if it cannot be\ncorrected immediately. This is\nanother very counterintuitive\npractice. An assembly line works\nbest when it is functioning smoothly,\nrolling car after car off the end of the\nline. The andon cord can interrupt\nthis careful flow as the line is halted\nrepeatedly. However, the benefits of\nfinding and fixing problems faster\noutweigh this cost. This process of\ncontinuously driving out defects has\nbeen a win-win for Toyota and its\ncustomers. It is the root cause of\nToyota’s historic high quality ratings\nand low costs.\nSMALL BATCHES IN\nENTREPRENEURSHIP\nWhen I teach entrepreneurs this\nmethod, I often begin with stories\nabout manufacturing. Before long, I\ncan see the questioning looks: what\ndoes this have to do with my startup?\nThe theory that is the foundation of\nToyota’s success can be used to\ndramatically improve the speed at\nwhich startups find validated\nlearning.\nToyota discovered that small\nbatches made their factories more\nefficient. In contrast, in the Lean\nStartup the goal is not to produce\nmore stuff efficiently. It is to—as\nquickly as possible—learn how to\nbuild a sustainable business.\nThink back to the example of\nenvelope stuffing. What if it turns\nout that the customer doesn’t want\nthe product we’re building?\nAlthough this is never good news for\nan entrepreneur, finding out sooner is\nmuch better than finding out later.\nWorking in small batches ensures\nthat a startup can minimize the\nexpenditure of time, money, and\neffort that ultimately turns out to\nhave been wasted.\nSmall Batches at IMVU\nAt IMVU, we applied these lessons\nfrom manufacturing to the way we\nwork. Normally, new versions of\nproducts like ours are released to\ncustomers on a monthly, quarterly, or\nyearly cycle.\nTake a look at your cell phone.\nOdds are, it is not the very first\nversion of its kind. Even innovative\ncompanies such as Apple produce a\nnew version of their flagship phones\nabout once a year. Bundled up in that\nproduct release are dozens of new\nfeatures (at the release of iPhone 4,\nApple boasted more than 1,500\nchanges).\nIronically, many high-tech\nproducts are manufactured in\nadvanced facilities that follow the\nlatest in lean thinking, including\nsmall batches and single-piece flow.\nHowever, the process that is used to\ndesign the product is stuck in the era\nof mass production. Think of all the\nchanges that are made to a product\nsuch as the iPhone; all 1,500 of them\nare released to customers in one\ngiant batch.\nBehind the scenes, in the\ndevelopment and design of the\nproduct itself, large batches are still\nthe rule. The work that goes into the\ndevelopment of a new product\nproceeds on a virtual assembly line.\nProduct managers figure out what\nfeatures are likely to please\ncustomers; product designers then\nfigure out how those features should\nlook and feel. These designs are\npassed to engineering, which builds\nsomething new or modifies an\nexisting product and, once this is\ndone, hands it off to somebody\nresponsible for verifying that the new\nproduct works the way the product\nmanagers and designers intended.\nFor a product such as the iPhone,\nthese internal handoffs may happen\non a monthly or quarterly basis.\nThink back one more time to the\nenvelope-stuffing exercise. What is\nthe most efficient way to do this\nwork?\nAt IMVU, we attempted to design,\ndevelop, and ship our new features\none at a time, taking advantage of the\npower of small batches. Here’s what\nit looked like.\nInstead of working in separate\ndepartments, engineers and designers\nwould work together side by side on\none feature at a time. Whenever that\nfeature was ready to be tested with\ncustomers, they immediately would\nrelease a new version of the product,\nwhich would go live on our website\nfor a relatively small number of\npeople. The team would be able\nimmediately to assess the impact of\ntheir work, evaluate its effect on\ncustomers, and decide what to do\nnext. For tiny changes, the whole\nprocess might be repeated several\ntimes per day. In fact, in the\naggregate, IMVU makes about fifty\nchanges to its product (on average)\nevery single day.\nJust as with the Toyota Production\nSystem, the key to being able to\noperate this quickly is to check for\ndefects immediately, thus preventing\nbigger problems later. For example,\nwe had an extensive set of automated\ntests that assured that after every\nchange our product still worked as\ndesigned. Let’s say an engineer\naccidentally removed an important\nfeature, such as the checkout button\non one of our e-commerce pages.\nWithout this button, customers no\nlonger could buy anything from\nIMVU. It’s as if our business\ninstantly became a hobby.\nAnalogously to the Toyota andon\ncord, IMVU used an elaborate set of\ndefense mechanisms that prevented\nengineers from accidentally breaking\nsomething important.\nWe called this our product’s\nimmune system because those\nautomatic protections went beyond\nchecking that the product behaved as\nexpected. We also continuously\nmonitored the health of our business\nitself so that mistakes were found\nand removed automatically.\nGoing back to our business-to-\nhobby example of the missing\ncheckout button, let’s make the\nproblem a little more interesting.\nImagine that instead of removing the\nbutton altogether, an engineer makes\na mistake and changes the button’s\ncolor so that it is now white on a\nwhite background. From the point of\nview of automated functional tests,\nthe button is still there and\neverything is working normally;\nfrom the customer’s point of view,\nthe button is gone, and so nobody\ncan buy anything. This class of\nproblems is hard to detect solely with\nautomation but is still catastrophic\nfrom a business point of view. At\nIMVU, our immune system is\nprogrammed to detect these business\nconsequences and automatically\ninvoke our equivalent of the andon\ncord.\nWhen our immune system detects\na problem, a number of things\nhappen immediately:\n1. The defective change is\nremoved immediately and\nautomatically.\n2. Everyone on the relevant\nteam is notified of the\nproblem.\n3. The team is blocked from\nintroducing any further\nc h a n g e s , preventing the\nproblem from being\ncompounded by future\nmistakes …\n4. … until the root cause of the\nproblem is found and fixed.\n(This root cause analysis is\ndiscussed in greater detail in\nChapter 11.)\nAt IMVU, we called this\ncontinuous deployment, and even in\nthe fast-moving world of software\ndevelopment it is still considered\ncontroversial.3 As the Lean Startup\nmovement has gained traction, it has\ncome to be embraced by more and\nmore startups, even those that\noperate mission-critical applications.\nAmong the most cutting edge\nexamples is Wealthfront, whose\npivot was described in Chapter 8.\nThe company practices true\ncontinuous deployment—including\nmore than a dozen releases to\ncustomers every day—in an SECregulated environment.4\nContinuous Deployment Beyond\nSoftware\nWhen I tell this story to people who\nwork in a slower-moving industry,\nthey think I am describing something\nfuturistic. But increasingly, more and\nmore industries are seeing their\ndesign process accelerated by the\nsame underlying forces that make\nthis kind of rapid iteration possible in\nthe software industry. There are three\nways in which this is happening:\n1. Hardware becoming software.\nThink about what has happened in\nconsumer electronics. The latest\nphones and tablet computers are little\nmore than a screen connected to the\nInternet. Almost all of their value is\ndetermined by their software. Even\nold-school products such as\nautomobiles are seeing ever-larger\nparts of their value being generated\nby the software they carry inside,\nwhich controls everything from the\nentertainment system to tuning the\nengine to controlling the brakes.\nWhat can be built out of software\ncan be modified much faster than a\nphysical or mechanical device can.\n2. Fast production changes.\nBecause of the success of the lean\nmanufacturing movement, many\nassembly lines are set up to allow\neach new product that comes off the\nline to be customized completely\nwithout sacrificing quality or costeffectiveness. Historically, this has\nbeen used to offer the customer\nmany choices of product, but in the\nfuture, this capability will allow the\ndesigners of products to get much\nfaster feedback about new versions.\nWhen the design changes, there is no\nexcess inventory of the old version to\nslow things down. Since machines\nare designed for rapid changeovers,\nas soon as the new design is ready,\nnew versions can be produced\nquickly.\n3. 3D printing and rapid\nprototyping tools. As just one\nexample, most products and parts\nthat are made out of plastic today are\nmass produced using a technique\ncalled injection molding. This\nprocess is extremely expensive and\ntime-consuming to set up, but once it\nis up and running, it can reproduce\nhundreds of thousands of identical\nindividual items at an extremely low\ncost. It is a classic large-batch\nproduction process. This has put\nentrepreneurs who want to develop a\nnew physical product at a\ndisadvantage, since in general only\nlarge companies can afford these\nlarge production runs for a new\nproduct. However, new technologies\nare allowing entrepreneurs to build\nsmall batches of products that are of\nthe same quality as products made\nwith injection molding, but at much\nlower cost and much, much faster.\nThe essential lesson is not that\neveryone should be shipping fifty\ntimes per day but that by reducing\nbatch size, we can get through the\nBuild-Measure-Learn feedback loop\nmore quickly than our competitors\ncan. The ability to learn faster from\ncustomers is the essential\ncompetitive advantage that startups\nmust possess.\nSMALL BATCHES IN ACTION\nTo see this process in action, let me\nintroduce you to a company in Boise,\nIdaho, called SGW Designworks.\nSGW’s specialty is rapid production\ntechniques for physical products.\nMany of its clients are startups.\nSGW Designworks was engaged\nby a client who had been asked by a\nmilitary customer to build a complex\nfield x-ray system to detect\nexplosives and other destructive\ndevices at border crossings and in\nwar zones.\nConceptually, the system\nconsisted of an advanced head unit\nthat read x-ray film, multiple x-ray\nfilm panels, and the framework to\nhold the panels while the film was\nbeing exposed. The client already\nhad the technology for the x-ray\npanels and the head unit, but to make\nthe product work in rugged military\nsettings, SGW needed to design and\ndeliver the supporting structure that\nwould make the technology usable in\nthe field. The framework had to be\nstable to ensure a quality x-ray\nimage, durable enough for use in a\nwar zone, easy to deploy with\nminimal training, and small enough\nto collapse into a backpack.\nThis is precisely the kind of\nproduct we are accustomed to\nthinking takes months or years to\ndevelop, yet new techniques are\nshrinking that time line. SGW\nimmediately began to generate the\nvisual prototypes by using 3D\ncomputer-aided design (CAD)\nsoftware. The 3D models served as a\nrapid communication tool between\nthe client and the SGW team to make\nearly design decisions.\nThe team and client settled on a\ndesign that used an advanced locking\nhinge to provide the collapsibility\nr e q u i r e d without compromising\nstability. The design also integrated a\nsuction cup/pump mechanism to\nallow for fast, repeatable attachment\nto the x-ray panels. Sounds\ncomplicated, right?\nThree days later, the SGW team\ndelivered the first physical\nprototypes to the client. The\nprototypes were machined out of\naluminum directly from the 3D\nmodel, using a technique called\ncomputer numerical control (CNC)\nand were hand assembled by the\nSGW team.\nThe client immediately took the\nprototypes to its military contact for\nreview. The general concept was\naccepted with a number of minor\ndesign modifications. In the next five\ndays, another full cycle of design\niteration, prototyping, and design\nreview was completed by the client\nand SGW. The first production run\nof forty completed units was ready\nfor delivery three and a half weeks\nafter the initiation of the\ndevelopment project.\nSGW realized that this was a\nwinning model because feedback on\ndesign decisions was nearly\ninstantaneous. The team used the\nsame process to design and deliver\neight products, serving a wide range\nof functions, in a twelve-month\nperiod. Half of those products are\ngenerating revenue today, and the\nrest are awaiting initial orders, all\nthanks to the power of working in\nsmall batches.\nTHE PROJECT TIME LINE\nDesign and engineering of the initial virtual prototype 1 day\nProduction and assembly of initial hard prototypes 3 days\nDesign iteration: two additional cycles 5 days\nInitial production run and assembly of initial forty units 15 days\nSmall Batches in Education\nNot every type of product—as it\nexists today—allows for design\nchange in small batches. But that is\nno excuse for sticking to outdated\nmethods. A significant amount of\nwork may be needed to enable\ninnovators to experiment in small\nbatches. As was pointed out in\nChapter 2, for established companies\nlooking to accelerate their innovation\nteams, building this platform for\nexperimentation is the responsibility\nof senior management.\nImagine that you are a\nschoolteacher in charge of teaching\nmath to middle school students.\nAlthough you may teach concepts in\nsmall batches, one day at a time,\nyour overall curriculum cannot\nchange very often. Because you must\nset up the curriculum in advance and\nteach the same concepts in the same\norder to every student in the\nclassroom, you can try a new\ncurriculum at most only once a year.\nHow could a math teacher\nexperiment with small batches?\nUnder the current large-batch system\nfor educating students, it would be\nquite difficult; our current\neducational system was designed in\nthe era of mass production and uses\nlarge batches extensively.\nA new breed of startups is\nworking hard to change all that. In\nSchool of One, students have daily\n“playlists” of their learning tasks that\nare attuned to each student’s learning\nneeds, based on that student’s\nreadiness and learning style. For\nexample, Julia is way ahead of grade\nlevel in math and learns best in small\ngroups, so her playlist might include\nthree or four videos matched to her\naptitude level, a thirty-minute one-\non-one tutoring session with her\nteacher, and a small group activity in\nwhich she works on a math puzzle\nwith three peers at similar aptitude\nlevels. There are assessments built\ninto each activity so that data can be\nfed back to the teacher to choose\nappropriate tasks for the next\nplaylist. This data can be aggregated\nacross classes, schools, or even\nwhole districts.\nNow imagine trying to experiment\nwith a curriculum by using a tool\nsuch as School of One. Each student\nis working at his or her own pace.\nLet’s say you are a teacher who has a\nnew sequence in mind for how math\nconcepts should be taught. You can\nsee immediately the impact of the\nchange on those of your students\nwho are at that point in the\ncurriculum. If you judge it to be a\ngood change, you could roll it out\nimmediately for every single student;\nwhen they get to that part of the\ncurriculum, they will get the new\nsequence automatically. In other\nwords, tools like School of One\nenable teachers to work in much\nsmaller batches, to the benefit of\ntheir students. (And, as tools reach\nwide-scale adoption, successful\nexperiments by individual teachers\ncan be rolled out district-, city-, or\neven nationwide.) This approach is\nhaving an impact and earning\naccolades. Time magazine recently\nincluded School of One in its “most\ninnovative ideas” list; it was the only\neducational organization to make the\nlist.5\nTHE LARGE-BATCH DEATH\nSPIRAL\nSmall batches pose a challenge to\nmanagers steeped in traditional\nnotions of productivity and progress,\nbecause they believe that functional\nspecialization is more efficient for\nexpert workers.\nImagine you’re a product designer\noverseeing a new product and you\nneed to produce thirty individual\ndesign drawings. It probably seems\nthat the most efficient way to work is\nin seclusion, by yourself, producing\nthe designs one by one. Then, when\nyou’re done with all of them, you\npass the drawings on to the\nengineering team and let them work.\nIn other words, you work in large\nbatches.\nFrom the point of view of\nindividual efficiency, working in\nlarge batches makes sense. It also\nhas other benefits: it promotes skill\nbuilding, makes it easier to hold\nindividual contributors accountable,\nand, most important, allows experts\nto work without interruption. At least\nthat’s the theory. Unfortunately,\nreality seldom works out that way.\nConsider our hypothetical\nexample. After passing thirty design\ndrawings to engineering, the\ndesigner is free to turn his or her\nattention to the next project. But\nremember the problems that came up\nduring the envelope-stuffing\nexercise. What happens when\nengineering has questions about how\nthe drawings are supposed to work?\nWhat if some of the drawings are\nunclear? What if something goes\nwrong when engineering attempts to\nuse the drawings?\nThese problems inevitably turn\ninto interruptions for the designer,\nand now those interruptions are\ninterfering with the next large batch\nthe designer is supposed to be\nworking on. If the drawings need to\nbe redone, the engineers may\nbecome idle while they wait for the\nrework to be completed. If the\ndesigner is not available, the\nengineers may have to redo the\ndesigns themselves. This is why so\nfew products are actually built the\nway they are designed.\nWhen I work with product\nmanagers and designers in\ncompanies that use large batches, I\noften discover that they have to redo\ntheir work five or six times for every\nrelease. One product manager I\nworked with was so inundated with\ninterruptions that he took to coming\ninto the office in the middle of the\nnight so that he could work\nuninterrupted. When I suggested that\nhe try switching the work process\nfrom large-batch to single-piece\nflow, he refused—because that\nwould be inefficient! So strong is the\ninstinct to work in large batches, that\neven when a large-batch system is\nmalfunctioning, we have a tendency\nto blame ourselves.\nLarge batches tend to grow over\ntime. Because moving the batch\nforward often results in additional\nwork, rework, delays, and\ninterruptions, everyone has an\nincentive to do work in ever-larger\nbatches, trying to minimize this\noverhead. This is called the largebatch death spiral because, unlike in\nmanufacturing, there are no physical\nlimits on the maximum size of a\nbatch.6 It is possible for batch size to\nkeep growing and growing.\nEventually, one batch will become\nthe highest-priority project, a “bet\nthe company” new version of the\nproduct, because the company has\ntaken such a long time since the last\nrelease. But now the managers are\nincentivized to increase batch size\nrather than ship the product. In light\nof how long the product has been in\ndevelopment, why not fix one more\nbug or add one more feature? Who\nreally wants to be the manager who\nrisked the success of this huge\nrelease by failing to address a\npotentially critical flaw?\nI worked at a company that\nentered this death spiral. We had\nbeen working for months on a new\nversion of a really cool product. The\noriginal version had been years in the\nmaking, and expectations for the\nnext release were incredibly high.\nBut the longer we worked, the more\nafraid we became of how customers\nwould react when they finally saw\nthe new version. As our plans\nbecame more ambitious, so too did\nthe number of bugs, conflicts, and\nproblems we had to deal with. Pretty\nsoon we got into a situation in which\nwe could not ship anything. Our\nlaunch date seemed to recede into\nthe distance. The more work we got\ndone, the more work we had to do.\nThe lack of ability to ship eventually\nprecipitated a crisis and a change of\nmanagement, all because of the trap\nof large batches.\nThese misconceptions about batch\nsize are incredibly common. Hospital\npharmacies often deliver big batches\nof medications to patient floors once\na day because it’s efficient (a single\ntrip, right?). But many of those meds\nget sent back to the pharmacy when\na patient’s orders have changed or\nthe patient is moved or discharged,\ncausing the pharmacy staff to do lots\nof rework and reprocessing (or\ntrashing) of meds. Delivering smaller\nbatches every four hours reduces the\ntotal workload for the pharmacy and\nensures that the right meds are at the\nright place when needed.\nHospital lab blood collections\noften are done in hourly batches;\nphlebotomists collect blood for an\nhour from multiple patients and then\nsend or take all the samples to the\nlab. This adds to turnaround time for\ntest results and can harm test quality.\nIt has become common for hospitals\nto bring small batches (two patients)\nor a single-patient flow of specimens\nto the lab even if they have to hire an\nextra phlebotomist or two to do so,\nbecause the total system cost is\nlower.7\nPULL, DON’T PUSH\nLet’s say you are out for a drive,\npondering the merits of small\nbatches, and find yourself\naccidentally putting a dent in your\nnew 2011 blue Toyota Camry. You\ntake it into the dealership for repair\nand wait to hear the bad news. The\nrepair technician tells you that you\nneed to have the bumper replaced.\nHe goes to check their inventory\nlevels and tells you he has a new\nbumper in stock and they can\ncomplete your repair immediately.\nThis is good news for everyone—\nyou because you get your car back\nsooner and the dealership because\nthey have a happy customer and\ndon’t run the risk of your taking the\ncar somewhere else for repair. Also,\nthey don’t have to store your car or\ngive you a loaner while they wait for\nthe part to come in.\nIn traditional mass production, the\nway to avoid stockouts—not having\nthe product the customer wants—is\nto keep a large inventory of spares\njust in case. It may be that the blue\n2011 Camry bumper is quite popular,\nbut what about last year’s model or\nthe model from five years ago? The\nmore inventory you keep, the greater\nthe likelihood you will have the right\nproduct in stock for every customer.\nBut large inventories are expensive\nbecause they have to be transported,\nstored, and tracked. What if the 2011\nbumper turns out to have a defect?\nAll the spares in all the warehouses\ninstantly become waste.\nLean production solves the\nproblem of stockouts with a\ntechnique called pull. When you\nbring a car into the dealership for\nrepair, one blue 2011 Camry bumper\ngets used. This creates a “hole” in\nthe dealer’s inventory, which\nautomatically causes a signal to be\nsent to a local restocking facility\ncalled the Toyota Parts Distribution\nCenter (PDC). The PDC sends the\ndealer a new bumper, which creates\nanother hole in inventory. This sends\na similar signal to a regional\nwarehouse called the Toyota Parts\nRedistribution Center (PRC), where\nall parts suppliers ship their products.\nThat warehouse signals the factory\nwhere the bumpers are made to\nproduce one more bumper, which is\nmanufactured and shipped to the\nPRC.\nThe ideal goal is to achieve small\nbatches all the way down to singlepiece flow along the entire supply\nchain. Each step in the line pulls the\nparts it needs from the previous step.\nThis is the famous Toyota just-intime production method.8\nWhen companies switch to this\nkind of production, their warehouses\nimmediately shrink, as the amount of\njust-in-case inventory [called workin-progress (WIP) inventory] is\nreduced dramatically. This almost\nmagical shrinkage of WIP is where\nlean manufacturing gets its name.\nIt’s as if the whole supply chain\nsuddenly went on a diet.\nStartups struggle to see their workin-progress inventory. When\nfactories have excess WIP, it literally\npiles up on the factory floor. Because\nmost startup work is intangible, it’s\nnot nearly as visible. For example,\nall the work that goes into designing\nthe minimum viable product is—\nuntil the moment that product is\nshipped—just WIP inventory.\nIncomplete designs, not-yetvalidated assumptions, and most\nbusiness plans are WIP. Almost\nevery Lean Startup technique we’ve\ndiscussed so far works its magic in\ntwo ways: by converting push\nmethods to pull and reducing batch\nsize. Both have the net effect of\nreducing WIP.\nIn manufacturing, pull is used\nprimarily to make sure production\nprocesses are tuned to levels of\ncustomer demand. Without this,\nfactories can wind up making much\nmore—or much less—of a product\nthan customers really want.\nHowever, applying this approach to\ndeveloping new products is not\nstraightforward. Some people\nmisunderstand the Lean Startup\nmodel as simply applying pull to\ncustomer wants. This assumes that\ncustomers could tell us what\nproducts to build and that this would\nact as the pull signal to product\ndevelopment to make them.9\nAs was mentioned earlier, this is\nnot the way the Lean Startup model\nworks, because customers often\ndon’t know what they want. Our goal\nin building products is to be able to\nrun experiments that will help us\nlearn how to build a sustainable\nbusiness. Thus, the right way to think\nabout the product development\nprocess in a Lean Startup is that it is\nresponding to pull requests in the\nform of experiments that need to be\nrun.\nAs soon as we formulate a\nhypothesis that we want to test, the\nproduct development team should be\nengineered to design and run this\nexperiment as quickly as possible,\nusing the smallest batch size that will\nget the job done. Remember that\nalthough we write the feedback loop\nas Build-Measure-Learn because the\nactivities happen in that order, our\nplanning really works in the reverse\norder: we figure out what we need to\nlearn and then work backwards to\nsee what product will work as an\nexperiment to get that learning. Thus,\nit is not the customer, but rather our\nhypothesis about the customer, that\npulls work from product\ndevelopment and other functions.\nAny other work is waste.\nHypothesis Pull in Clean Tech\nTo see this in action, let’s take a look\nat Berkeley-based startup Alphabet\nEnergy. Any machine or process that\ngenerates power, whether it is a\nmotor in a factory or a coal-burning\npower plant, generates heat as a by-\nproduct. Alphabet Energy has\ndeveloped a product that can\ngenerate electricity from this waste\nheat, using a new kind of material\ncalled a thermoelectric. Alphabet\nEnergy’s thermoelectric material was\ndeveloped over ten years by\nscientists at the Lawrence Berkeley\nNational Laboratories.\nAs with many clean technology\nproducts, there are huge challenges\nin bringing a product like this to\nmarket. While working through its\nleap-of-faith assumptions, Alphabet\nfigured out early that developing a\nsolution for waste thermoelectricity\nrequired building a heat exchanger\nand a generic device to transfer heat\nfrom one medium to another as well\nas doing project-specific\nengineering. For instance, if\nAlphabet wanted to build a solution\nfor a utility such as Pacific Gas and\nElectric, the heat exchanger would\nhave to be configured, shaped, and\ninstalled to capture the heat from a\npower plant’s exhaust system.\nWhat makes Alphabet Energy\nunique is that the company made a\nsavvy decision early on in the\nresearch process. Instead of using\nrelatively rare elements as materials,\nthey decided to base their research\non silicon wafers, the same physical\nsubstance that computer central\nprocessing units (CPUs) are made\nfrom. As CEO Matthew Scullin\nexplains, “Our thermoelectric is the\nonly one that can use low-cost\nsemiconductor infrastructure for\nmanufacturing.” This has enabled\nAlphabet Energy to design and build\nits products in small batches.\nBy contrast, most successful clean\ntechnology startups have had to\nmake substantial early investments.\nThe solar panel provider SunPower\nhad to build in factories to\nmanufacture its panels and partner\nwith installers before becoming fully\noperational. Similarly, BrightSource\nraised $291 million to build and\noperate large-scale solar plants\nwithout delivering a watt to a single\ncustomer.\nInstead of having to invest time\nand money in expensive fabrication\nfacilities, Alphabet is able to take\nadvantage of the massive existing\ninfrastructure that produces silicon\nwafers for computer electronics. As a\nresult, Alphabet can go from a\nproduct concept to holding a\nphysical version in its hand in just\nsix weeks from end to end.\nAlphabet’s challenge has been to\nfind the combination of performance,\nprice, and physical shape that is a\nmatch for early customers. Although\nits technology has revolutionary\npotential, early adopters will deploy\nit only if they can see a clear return\non investment.\nIt might seem that the most\nobvious market for Alphabet’s\ntechnology would be power plants,\nand indeed, that was the team’s\ninitial hypothesis. Alphabet\nhypothesized that simple cycle gas\nturbines would be an ideal\napplication; these turbines, which are\nsimilar to jet engines strapped to the\nground, are used by power\ngenerators to provide energy for peak\ndemand. Alphabet believed that\nattaching its semiconductors to those\nturbines would be simple and cheap.\nThe company went about testing\nthis hypothesis in small batches by\nbuilding small-scale solutions for its\ncustomers as a way of learning. As\nwith many initial ideas, their\nhypothesis was disproved quickly.\nPower companies have a low\ntolerance for risk, making them\nunlikely to become early adopters.\nBecause it wasn’t weighed down by\na large-batch approach, Alphabet\nwas ready to pivot after just three\nmonths of investigation.\nAlphabet has eliminated many\nother potential markets as well,\nleading to a series of customer\nsegment pivots. The company’s\ncurrent efforts are focused on\nmanufacturing firms, which have the\nability to experiment with new\ntechnologies in separate parts of their\nfactory; this allows early adopters to\nevaluate the real-world benefits\nbefore committing to a larger\ndeployment. These early\ndeployments are putting more of\nAlphabet’s assumptions to the test.\nUnlike in the computer hardware\nbusiness, customers are not willing\nto pay top dollar for maximum\nperformance. This has required\nsignificant changes in Alphabet’s\nproduct, configuring it to achieve the\nlowest cost per watt possible.\nAll this experimentation has cost\nthe company a tiny fraction of what\nother energy startups have\nconsumed. To date, Alphabet has\nraised approximately $1 million.\nOnly time will tell if they will\nprevail, but thanks to the power of\nsmall batches, they will be able to\ndiscover the truth much faster.10\nThe Toyota Production System is\nprobably the most advanced system\nof management in the world, but\neven more impressive is the fact that\nToyota has built the most advanced\nlearning organization in history. It\nhas demonstrated an ability to\nunleash the creativity of its\nemployees, achieve consistent\ngrowth, and produce innovative new\nproducts relentlessly over the course\nof nearly a century.11\nThis is the kind of long-term\nsuccess to which entrepreneurs\nshould aspire. Although lean\nproduction techniques are powerful,\nthey are only a manifestation of a\nhigh-functioning organization that is\ncommitted to achieving maximum\nperformance by employing the right\nmeasures of progress over the long\nterm. Process is only the foundation\nupon which a great company culture\ncan develop. But without this\nfoundation, efforts to encourage\nlearning, creativity, and innovation\nwill fall flat—as many disillusioned\ndirectors of HR can attest.\nThe Lean Startup works only if we\nare able to build an organization as\nadaptable and fast as the challenges\nit faces. This requires tackling the\nhuman challenges inherent in this\nnew way of working; that is the\nsubject of the remainder of Part\nThree.\nTHE STARTUP WAY\n\n10\nGROW\nI recently had two startups seek my\nadvice on the same day. As types of\nbusinesses, they could not have been\nmore different. The first is\ndeveloping a marketplace to help\ntraders of collectibles connect with\none another. These people are hardcore fans of movies, anime, or\ncomics who strive to put together\ncomplete collections of toys and\nother promotional merchandise\nrelated to the characters they love.\nThe startup aspires to compete with\nonline marketplaces such as eBay as\nwell as physical marketplaces\nattached to conventions and other\ngatherings of fans.\nThe second startup sells database\nsoftware to enterprise customers.\nThey have a next-generation\ndatabase technology that can\nsupplement or replace offerings from\nlarge companies such as Oracle,\nIBM, and SAP. Their customers are\nchief information officers (CIOs), IT\nmanagers, and engineers in some of\nthe world’s largest organizations.\nThese are long-lead-time sales that\nrequire salespeople, sales\nengineering, installation support, and\nmaintenance contracts.\nYou could be forgiven for thinking\nthese two companies have absolutely\nnothing in common, yet both came to\nme with the exact same problem.\nEach one had early customers and\npromising early revenue. They had\nvalidated and invalidated many\nhypotheses in their business models\nand were executing against their\nproduct road maps successfully.\nTheir customers had provided a\nhealthy mix of positive feedback and\nsuggestions for improvements. Both\ncompanies had used their early\nsuccess to raise money from outside\ninvestors.\nThe problem was that neither\ncompany was growing.\nBoth CEOs brought me identicallooking graphs showing that their\nearly growth had flatlined. They\ncould not understand why. They\nwere acutely aware of the need to\nshow progress to their employees\nand investors and came to me\nbecause they wanted advice on how\nto jump-start their growth. Should\nthey invest in more advertising or\nmarketing programs? Should they\nfocus on product quality or new\nfeatures? Should they try to improve\nconversion rates or pricing?\nAs it turns out, both companies\nshare a deep similarity in the way\ntheir businesses grow—and therefore\na similar confusion about what to do.\nBoth are using the same engine of\ngrowth, the topic of this chapter.\nWHERE DOES GROWTH\nCOME FROM?\nThe engine of growth is the\nmechanism that startups use to\nachieve sustainable growth. I use the\nword sustainable to exclude all onetime activities that generate a surge\nof customers but have no long-term\nimpact, such as a single\nadvertisement or a publicity stunt\nthat might be used to jump-start\ngrowth but could not sustain that\ngrowth for the long term.\nSustainable growth is\ncharacterized by one simple rule:\nNew customers come from the\nactions of past customers.\nThere are four primary ways past\ncustomers drive sustainable growth:\n1. Word of mouth. Embedded in\nmost products is a natural level of\ngrowth that is caused by satisfied\ncustomers’ enthusiasm for the\nproduct. For example, when I bought\nmy first TiVo DVR, I couldn’t stop\ntelling my friends and family about\nit. Pretty soon, my entire family was\nusing one.\n2. As a side effect of product\nusage. Fashion or status, such as\nluxury goods products, drive\nawareness of themselves whenever\nthey are used. When you see\nsomeone dressed in the latest clothes\nor driving a certain car, you may be\ninfluenced to buy that product. This\nis also true of so-called viral\nproducts such as Facebook and\nPayPal. When a customer sends\nmoney to a friend using PayPal, the\nfriend is exposed automatically to\nthe PayPal product.\n3. Through funded advertising.\nMost businesses employ advertising\nto entice new customers to use their\nproducts. For this to be a source of\nsustainable growth, the advertising\nmust be paid for out of revenue, not\none-time sources such as investment\ncapital. As long as the cost of\nacquiring a new customer (the socalled marginal cost) is less than the\nrevenue that customer generates (the\nmarginal revenue), the excess (the\nmarginal profit) can be used to\nacquire more customers. The more\nmarginal profit, the faster the growth.\n4. Through repeat purchase or\nuse. Some products are designed to\nbe purchased repeatedly either\nthrough a subscription plan (a cable\ncompany) or through voluntary\nrepurchases (groceries or lightbulbs).\nBy contrast, many products and\nservices are intentionally designed as\none-time events, such as wedding\nplanning.\nThese sources of sustainable growth\npower feedback loops that I have\ntermed engines of growth. Each is\nlike a combustion engine, turning\nover and over. The faster the loop\nturns, the faster the company will\ngrow. Each engine has an intrinsic\nset of metrics that determine how\nfast a company can grow when using\nit.\nTHE THREE ENGINES OF\nGROWTH\nWe saw in Part Two how important\nit is for startups to use the right kind\nof metrics—actionable metrics—to\nevaluate their progress. However,\nthis leaves a large amount of variety\nin terms of which numbers one\nshould measure. In fact, one of the\nmost expensive forms of potential\nwaste for a startup is spending time\narguing about how to prioritize new\ndevelopment once it has a product on\nthe market. At any time, the\ncompany could invest its energy in\nfinding new customers, servicing\nexisting customers better, improving\noverall quality, or driving down\ncosts. In my experience, the\ndiscussions about these kinds of\npriority decisions can consume a\nsubstantial fraction of the company’s\ntime.\nEngines of growth are designed to\ngive startups a relatively small set of\nmetrics on which to focus their\nenergies. As one of my mentors, the\nventure capital investor Shawn\nCarolan, put it, “Startups don’t\nstarve; they drown.” There are\nalways a zillion new ideas about how\nto make the product better floating\naround, but the hard truth is that\nmost of those ideas make a\ndifference only at the margins. They\nare mere optimizations. Startups\nhave to focus on the big experiments\nthat lead to validated learning. The\nengines of growth framework helps\nthem stay focused on the metrics that\nmatter.\nThe Sticky Engine of Growth\nThis brings us back to the two\nstartups that kicked off this chapter.\nBoth are using the exact same engine\nof growth despite being in very\ndifferent industries. Both products\nare designed to attract and retain\ncustomers for the long term. The\nunderlying mechanism of that\nretention is different in the two\ncases. For the collectible company,\nthe idea is to become the number one\nshopping destination for fanatical\ncollectors. These are people who are\nconstantly hunting for the latest\nitems and the best deals. If the\ncompany’s product works as\ndesigned, collectors who start using\nit will check constantly and\nrepeatedly to see if new items are for\nsale as well as listing their own items\nfor sale or trade.\nThe startup database vendor relies\non repeat usage for a very different\nreason. Database technology is used\nonly as the foundation for a\ncustomer’s own products, such as a\nwebsite or a point of sale system.\nOnce you build a product on top of a\nparticular database technology, it is\nextremely difficult to switch. In the\nIT industry, such customers are said\nto be locked in to the vendor they\nchoose. For such a product to grow,\nit has to offer such a compelling new\ncapability that customers are willing\nto risk being tied to a proprietary\nvendor for a potentially long time.\nThus, both businesses rely on\nhaving a high customer retention\nrate. They have an expectation that\nonce you start using their product,\nyou will continue to do so. This is\nthe same dynamic as a mobile\ntelephone service provider: when a\ncustomer cancels his or her service,\nit generally means that he or she is\nextremely dissatisfied or is switching\nto a competitor’s product. This is in\ncontrast to, say, groceries on a store\naisle. In the grocery retail business,\ncustomer tastes fluctuate, and if a\ncustomer buys a Pepsi this week\ninstead of Coke, it’s not necessarily a\nbig deal.\nTherefore, companies using the\nsticky engine of growth track their\nattrition rate or churn rate very\ncarefully. The churn rate is defined\nas the fraction of customers in any\nperiod who fail to remain engaged\nwith the company’s product.\nThe rules that govern the sticky\nengine of growth are pretty simple: if\nthe rate of new customer acquisition\nexceeds the churn rate, the product\nwill grow. The speed of growth is\ndetermined by what I call the rate of\ncompounding, which is simply the\nnatural growth rate minus the churn\nrate. Like a bank account that earns\ncompounding interest, having a high\nrate of compounding will lead to\nextremely rapid growth—without\nadvertising, viral growth, or publicity\nstunts.\nUnfortunately, both of these sticky\nstartups were tracking their progress\nusing generic indicators such as the\ntotal number of customers. Even the\nactionable metrics they were using,\nsuch as the activation rate and\nrevenue per customer, weren’t very\nhelpful because in the sticky engine\nof growth, these variables have little\nimpact on growth. (In the sticky\nengine of growth, they are better\nsuited to testing the value hypothesis\nthat was discussed in Chapter 5.)\nAfter our meeting, one of the two\nstartups took me up on my advice to\nmodel its customer behavior by\nusing the sticky engine of growth as\na template. The results were striking:\na 61 percent retention rate and a 39\npercent growth rate of new\ncustomers. In other words, its churn\nrate and new customer acquisition\nbalanced each other almost perfectly,\nleading to a compounding growth\nrate of just 0.02 percent—almost\nzero.\nThis is typical for companies in an\nengagement business that are\nstruggling to find growth. An insider\nwho worked at the dot-com-era\ncompany PointCast once showed me\nhow that company suffered a similar\ndysfunction. When PointCast was\nstruggling to grow, it was\nnonetheless incredibly successful in\nnew customer acquisition—just like\nthis sticky startup (39 percent every\nperiod). Unfortunately, this growth is\nbeing offset by an equivalent amount\nof churn. Once it is modeled this\nway, the good news should be\napparent: there are plenty of new\ncustomers coming in the door. The\nway to find growth is to focus on\nexisting customers for the product\neven more engaging to them. For\nexample, the company could focus\non getting more and better listings.\nThis would create an incentive for\ncustomers to check back often.\nAlternatively, the company could do\nsomething more direct such as\nmessaging them about limited-time\nsales or special offers. Either way, its\nfocus needs to be on improving\ncustomer retention. This goes against\nthe standard intuition in that if a\ncompany lacks growth, it should\ninvest more in sales and marketing.\nThis counterintuitive result is hard to\ninfer from standard vanity metrics.\nThe Viral Engine of Growth\nOnline social networks and\nTupperware are examples of\nproducts for which customers do the\nlion’s share of the marketing.\nAwareness of the product spreads\nrapidly from person to person\nsimilarly to the way a virus becomes\nan epidemic. This is distinct from the\nsimple word-of-mouth growth\ndiscussed above. Instead, products\nthat exhibit viral growth depend on\nperson-to-person transmission as a\nnecessary consequence of normal\nproduct use. Customers are not\nintentionally acting as evangelists;\nthey are not necessarily trying to\nspread the word about the product.\nGrowth happens automatically as a\nside effect of customers using the\nproduct. Viruses are not optional.\nFor example, one of the most\nfamous viral success stories is a\ncompany called Hotmail. In 1996,\nSabeer Bhatia and Jack Smith\nlaunched a new web-based e-mail\nservice that offered customers free\naccounts. At first, growth was\nsluggish; with only a small seed\ninvestment from the venture capital\nfirm Draper Fisher Jurvetson, the\nHotmail team could not afford an\nextensive marketing campaign. But\neverything changed when they made\none small tweak to the product. They\nadded to the bottom of every single\ne-mail the message “P.S. Get your\nfree e-mail at Hotmail” along with a\nclickable link.\nWithin weeks, that small product\nchange produced massive results.\nWithin six months, Bhatia and Smith\nhad signed up more than 1 million\nnew customers. Five weeks later,\nthey hit the 2 million mark. Eighteen\nmonths after launching the service,\nwith 12 million subscribers, they\nsold the company to Microsoft for\n$400 million.1\nThe same phenomenon is at work\nin Tupperware’s famous “house\nparties,” in which customers earn\ncommissions by selling the product\nto their friends and neighbors. Every\nsales pitch is an opportunity not only\nto sell Tupperware products but also\nto persuade other customers to\nbecome Tupperware representatives.\nTupperware parties are still going\nstrong decades after they started.\nMany other contemporary\ncompanies, such as Pampered Chef\n(owned by Warren Buffett’s\nBerkshire Hathaway), Southern\nLiving, and Tastefully Simple, have\nadopted a similar model\nsuccessfully.\nLike the other engines of growth,\nthe viral engine is powered by a\nfeedback loop that can be quantified.\nIt is called the viral loop, and its\nspeed is determined by a single\nmathematical term called the viral\ncoefficient. The higher this\ncoefficient is, the faster the product\nwill spread. The viral coefficient\nmeasures how many new customers\nwill use a product as a consequence\nof each new customer who signs up.\nPut another way, how many friends\nwill each customer bring with him or\nher? Since each friend is also a new\ncustomer, he or she has an\nopportunity to recruit yet more\nfriends.\nFor a product with a viral\ncoefficient of 0.1, one in every ten\ncustomers will recruit one of his or\nher friends. This is not a sustainable\nloop. Imagine that one hundred\ncustomers sign up. They will cause\nten friends to sign up. Those ten\nfriends will cause one additional\nperson to sign up, but there the loop\nwill fizzle out.\nBy contrast, a viral loop with a\ncoefficient that is greater than 1.0\nwill grow exponentially, because\neach person who signs up will bring,\non average, more than one other\nperson with him or her.\nTo see these effects graphically,\ntake a look at this chart:\nCompanies that rely on the viral\nengine of growth must focus on\nincreasing the viral coefficient more\nthan anything else, because even tiny\nchanges in this number will cause\ndramatic changes in their future\nprospects.\nA consequence of this is that\nmany viral products do not charge\ncustomers directly but rely on\nindirect sources of revenue such as\nadvertising. This is the case because\nviral products cannot afford to have\nany friction impede the process of\nsigning customers up and recruiting\ntheir friends. This can make testing\nthe value hypothesis for viral\nproducts especially challenging.\nThe true test of the value\nhypothesis is always a voluntary\nexchange of value between\ncustomers and the startup that serves\nthem. A lot of confusion stems from\nthe fact that this exchange can be\nmonetary, as in the case of\nTupperware, or nonmonetary, as in\nthe case of Facebook. In the viral\nengine of growth, monetary\nexchange does not drive new growth;\nit is useful only as an indicator that\ncustomers value the product enough\nto pay for it. If Facebook or Hotmail\nhad started charging customers in\ntheir early days, it would have been\nfoolish, as it would have impeded\ntheir ability to grow. However, it is\nnot true that customers do not give\nthese companies something of value:\nby investing their time and attention\nin the product, they make the product\nvaluable to advertisers. Companies\nthat sell advertising actually serve\ntwo different groups of customers—\nconsumers and advertisers—and\nexchange a different currency of\nvalue with each.2\nThis is markedly different from\ncompanies that actively use money\nto fuel their expansion, such as a\nretail chain that can grow as fast as it\ncan fund the opening of new stores at\nsuitable locations. These companies\nare using a different engine of\ngrowth altogether.\nThe Paid Engine of Growth\nImagine another pair of businesses.\nThe first makes $1 on each customer\nit signs up; the second makes\n$100,000 from each customer it\nsigns up. To predict which company\nwill grow faster, you need to know\nonly one additional thing: how much\nit costs to sign up a new customer.\nImagine that the first company\nuses Google AdWords to find new\ncustomers online and pays an\naverage of 80 cents each time a new\ncustomer joins. The second company\nsells heavy goods to large\ncompanies. Each sale requires a\nsignificant time investment from a\nsalesperson and on-site sales\nengineering to help install the\nproduct; these hard costs total up to\n$80,000 per new customer. Both\ncompanies will grow at the exact\nsame rate. Each has the same\nproportion of revenue (20 percent)\navailable to reinvest in new customer\nacquisition. If either company wants\nto increase its rate of growth, it can\ndo so in one of two ways: increase\nthe revenue from each customer or\ndrive down the cost of acquiring a\nnew customer.\nThat’s the paid engine of growth\nat work.\nIn relating the IMVU story in\nChapter 3, I talked about how we\nmade a major early mistake in setting\nup the IMVU strategy. We ultimately\nwound up having to make an engine\nof growth pivot. We originally\nthought that our IM add-on strategy\nwould allow the product to grow\nvirally. Unfortunately, customers\nrefused to go along with our brilliant\nstrategy.\nOur basic misconception was a\nbelief that customers would be\nwilling to use IMVU as an add-on to\nexisting instant messaging networks.\nWe believed that the product would\nspread virally through those\nnetworks, passed from customer to\ncustomer. The problem with that\ntheory is that some kinds of products\nare not compatible with viral growth.\nIMVU’s customers didn’t want to\nuse the product with their existing\nfriends. They wanted to use it to\nmake new friends. Unfortunately,\nthat meant they did not have a strong\nincentive to bring new customers to\nthe product; they viewed that as our\njob. Fortunately, IMVU was able to\ngrow by using paid advertising\nbecause our customers were willing\nto pay more for our product than it\ncost us to reach them via advertising.\nLike the other engines, the paid\nengine of growth is powered by a\nfeedback loop. Each customer pays a\ncertain amount of money for the\nproduct over his or her “lifetime” as\na customer. Once variable costs are\ndeducted, this usually is called the\ncustomer lifetime value (LTV). This\nrevenue can be invested in growth by\nbuying advertising.\nSuppose an advertisement costs\n$100 and causes fifty new customers\nto sign up for the service. This ad has\na cost per acquisition (CPA) of\n$2.00. In this example, if the product\nhas an LTV that is greater than $2,\nthe product will grow. The margin\nbetween the LTV and the CPA\ndetermines how fast the paid engine\nof growth will turn (this is called the\nmarginal profit). Conversely, if the\nCPA remains at $2.00 but the LTV\nfalls below $2.00, the company’s\ngrowth will slow. It may make up the\ndifference with one-time tactics such\nas using invested capital or publicity\nstunts, but those tactics are not\nsustainable. This was the fate of\nmany failed companies, including\nnotable dot-com flameouts that\nerroneously believed that they could\nlose money on each customer but, as\nthe old joke goes, make it up in\nvolume.\nAlthough I have explained the\npaid engine of growth in terms of\nadvertising, it is far broader than\nthat. Startups that employ an\noutbound sales force are also using\nthis engine, as are retail companies\nthat rely on foot traffic. All these\ncosts should be factored into the cost\nper acquisition.\nFor example, one startup I worked\nwith built collaboration tools for\nteams and groups. It went through a\nradical pivot, switching from a tool\nthat was used primarily by hobbyists\nand small clubs to one that was sold\nprimarily to enterprises,\nnongovernmental organizations\n(NGOs), and other extremely large\norganizations. However, they made\nthat customer segment pivot without\nchanging their engine of growth.\nPreviously, they had done customer\nacquisition online, using web-based\ndirect marketing techniques. I\nremember one early situation in\nwhich the company fielded a call\nfrom a major NGO that wanted to\nbuy its product and roll it out across\nmany divisions. The startup had an\n“unlimited” pricing plan, its most\nexpensive, that cost only a few\nhundred dollars per month. The\nNGO literally could not make the\npurchase because it had no process\nin place for buying something so\ninexpensive. Additionally, the NGO\nneeded substantial help in managing\nthe rollout, educating its staff on the\nnew tool, and tracking the impact of\nthe change; those were all services\nthe company was ill equipped to\noffer. Changing customer segments\nrequired them to switch to hiring a\nsizable outbound sales staff that\nspent time attending conferences,\neducating executives, and authoring\nwhite papers. Those much higher\ncosts came with a corresponding\nreward: the company switched from\nmaking only a few dollars per\ncustomer to making tens and then\nhundreds of thousands of dollars per\nmuch larger customer. Their new\nengine of growth led to sustained\nsuccess.\nMost sources of customer\nacquisition are subject to\ncompetition. For example, prime\nretail storefronts have more foot\ntraffic and are therefore more\nvaluable. Similarly, advertising that\nis targeted to more affluent\ncustomers generally costs more than\nadvertising that reaches the general\npublic. What determines these prices\nis the average value earned in\naggregate by the companies that are\nin competition for any given\ncustomer’s attention. Wealthy\nconsumers cost more to reach\nbecause they tend to become more\nprofitable customers.\nOver time, any source of customer\nacquisition will tend to have its CPA\nbid up by this competition. If\neveryone in an industry makes the\nsame amount of money on each sale,\nthey all will wind up paying most of\ntheir marginal profit to the source of\nacquisition. Thus, the ability to grow\nin the long term by using the paid\nengine requires a differentiated\nability to monetize a certain set of\ncustomers.\nIMVU is a case in point. Our\ncustomers were not considered very\nlucrative by other online services:\nthey included a lot of teenagers, lowincome adults, and international\ncustomers. Other services tended to\nassume those people would not pay\nfor anything online. At IMVU, we\ndeveloped techniques for collecting\nonline payments from customers\nwho did not have a credit card, such\nas allowing them to bill to their\nmobile phones or send us cash in the\nmail. Therefore, we could afford to\npay more to acquire those customers\nthan our competitors could.\nA Technical Caveat\nTechnically, more than one engine of\ngrowth can operate in a business at a\ntime. For example, there are products\nthat have extremely fast viral growth\nas well as extremely low customer\nchurn rates. Also, there is no reason\nwhy a product cannot have both high\nmargins and high retention.\nHowever, in my experience,\nsuccessful startups usually focus on\njust one engine of growth,\nspecializing in everything that is\nrequired to make it work. Companies\nthat attempt to build a dashboard that\nincludes all three engines tend to\ncause a lot of confusion because the\noperations expertise required to\nmodel all these effects\nsimultaneously is quite complicated.\nTherefore, I strongly recommend that\nstartups focus on one engine at a\ntime. Most entrepreneurs already\nhave a strong leap-of-faith\nhypothesis about which engine is\nmost likely to work. If they do not,\ntime spent out of the building with\ncustomers will quickly suggest one\nthat seems profitable. Only after\npursuing one engine thoroughly\nshould a startup consider a pivot to\none of the others.\nENGINES OF GROWTH\nDETERMINE\nPRODUCT/MARKET FIT\nMarc Andreessen, the legendary\nentrepreneur and investor and one of\nthe fathers of the World Wide Web,\ncoined the term product/market fit to\ndescribe the moment when a startup\nfinally finds a widespread set of\ncustomers that resonate with its\nproduct:\nIn a great market—a market\nwith lots of real potential\ncustomers—the market pulls\nproduct out of the startup. This\nis the story of search keyword\nadvertising, Internet auctions,\nand TCP/IP routers. Conversely,\nin a terrible market, you can\nhave the best product in the\nworld and an absolutely killer\nteam, and it doesn’t matter—\nyou’re going to fail.3\nWhen you see a startup that has\nfound a fit with a large market, it’s\nexhilarating. It leaves no room for\ndoubt. It is Ford’s Model T flying out\nof the factory as fast as it could be\nmade, Facebook sweeping college\ncampuses practically overnight, or\nLotus taking the business world by\nstorm, selling $54 million worth of\nLotus 1-2-3 in its first year of\noperation.\nStartups occasionally ask me to\nhelp them evaluate whether they\nhave achieved product/market fit. It’s\neasy to answer: if you are asking,\nyou’re not there yet. Unfortunately,\nthis doesn’t help companies figure\no u t how to get closer to\nproduct/market fit. How can you tell\nif you are on the verge of success or\nhopelessly far away?\nAlthough I don’t think Andreessen\nintended this as part of his definition,\nto many entrepreneurs it implies that\na pivot is a failure event—“our\nstartup has failed to achieve\nproduct/market fit.” It also implies\nthe inverse—that once our product\nhas achieved product/market fit, we\nwon’t have to pivot anymore. Both\nassumptions are wrong.\nI believe the concept of the engine\nof growth can put the idea of\nproduct/market fit on a more\nrigorous footing. Since each engine\nof growth can be defined\nquantitatively, each has a unique set\nof metrics that can be used to\nevaluate whether a startup is on the\nverge of achieving product/market\nfit. A startup with a viral coefficient\nof 0.9 or more is on the verge of\nsuccess. Even better, the metrics for\neach engine of growth work in\ntandem with the innovation\naccounting model discussed in\nChapter 7 to give direction to a\nstartup’s product development\nefforts. For example, if a startup is\nattempting to use the viral engine of\ngrowth, it can focus its development\nefforts on things that might affect\ncustomer behavior—on the viral loop\n—and safely ignore those that do\nnot. Such a startup does not need to\nspecialize in marketing, advertising,\nor sales functions. Conversely, a\ncompany using the paid engine needs\nto develop those marketing and sales\nfunctions urgently.\nA startup can evaluate whether it\nis getting closer to product/market fit\nas it tunes its engine by evaluating\neach trip through the Build-MeasureLearn feedback loop using\ninnovation accounting. What really\nmatters is not the raw numbers or\nvanity metrics but the direction and\ndegree of progress.\nFor example, imagine two startups\nthat are working diligently to tune\nthe sticky engine of growth. One has\na compounding rate of growth of 5\npercent, and the other 10 percent.\nWhich company is the better bet? On\nthe surface, it may seem that the\nlarger rate of growth is better, but\nwhat if each company’s innovation\naccounting dashboard looks like the\nfollowing chart?\nCOMPOUNDING GROWTH RATE AS\nOF\nCOMPANY\nA\nCOMPANY\nB\nSix months ago 0.1% 9.8%\nFive months ago 0.5% 9.6%\nFour months ago 2.0% 9.9%\nThree months ago 3.2% 9.8%\nTwo months ago 4.5% 9.7%\nOne month ago 5.0% 10.0%\nEven with no insight into these\ntwo companies’ gross numbers, we\ncan tell that company A is making\nreal progress whereas company B is\nstuck in the mud. This is true even\nthough company B is growing faster\nthan company A right now.\nWHEN ENGINES RUN OUT\nGetting a startup’s engine of growth\nup and running is hard enough, but\nthe truth is that every engine of\ngrowth eventually runs out of gas.\nEvery engine is tied to a given set of\ncustomers and their related habits,\npreferences, advertising channels,\nand interconnections. At some point,\nthat set of customers will be\nexhausted. This may take a long time\nor a short time, depending on one’s\nindustry and timing.\nChapter 6 emphasized the\nimportance of building the minimum\nviable product in such a way that it\ncontains no additional features\nbeyond what is required by early\nadopters. Following that strategy\nsuccessfully will unlock an engine of\ngrowth that can reach that target\naudience. However, making the\ntransition to mainstream customers\nwill require tremendous additional\nwork.4 Once we have a product that\nis growing among early adopters, we\ncould in theory stop work in product\ndevelopment entirely. The product\nwould continue to grow until it\nreached the limits of that early\nmarket. Then growth would level off\nor even stop completely. The\nchallenge comes from the fact that\nthis slowdown might take months or\neven years to take place. Recall from\nChapter 8 that IMVU failed this test\n—at first—for precisely this reason.\nSome unfortunate companies wind\nup following this strategy\ninadvertently. Because they are using\nvanity metrics and traditional\naccounting, they think they are\nmaking progress when they see their\nnumbers growing. They falsely\nbelieve they are making their product\nbetter when in fact they are having\nno impact on customer behavior. The\ngrowth is all coming from an engine\nof growth that is working—running\nefficiently to bring in new customers\n—not from improvements driven by\nproduct development. Thus, when\nthe growth suddenly slows, it\nprovokes a crisis.\nThis is the same problem that\nestablished companies experience.\nTheir past successes were built on a\nfinely tuned engine of growth. If that\nengine runs its course and growth\nslows or stops, there can be a crisis if\nthe company does not have new\nstartups incubating within its ranks\nthat can provide new sources of\ngrowth.\nCompanies of any size can suffer\nfrom this perpetual affliction. They\nneed to manage a portfolio of\nactivities, simultaneously tuning\ntheir engine of growth and\ndeveloping new sources of growth\nfor when that engine inevitably runs\nits course. How to do this is the\nsubject of Chapter 12. However,\nbefore we can manage that portfolio,\nwe need an organizational structure,\nculture, and discipline that can\nhandle these rapid and often\nunexpected changes. I call this an\nadaptive organization, and it is the\nsubject of Chapter 11.\n11\nADAPT\nWhen I was the CTO of IMVU, I\nthought I was doing a good job most\nof the time. I had built an agile\nengineering organization, and we\nwere successfully experimenting\nwith the techniques that would come\nto be known as the Lean Startup.\nHowever, on a couple of occasions I\nsuddenly realized that I was failing at\nmy job. For an achievement-oriented\nperson, that is incredibly disarming.\nWorst of all, you don’t get a memo.\nIf you did, it would read something\nlike this:\nDear Eric,\nCongratulations! The job you\nused to do at this company is no\nlonger available. However, you\nhave been transferred to a new\njob in the company. Actually,\nit’s not the same company\nanymore, even though it has the\nsame name and many of the\nsame people. And although the\njob has the same title, too, and\nyou used to be good at your old\njob, you’re already failing at the\nnew one. This transfer is\neffective as of six months ago,\nso this is to alert you that\nyou’ve already been failing at it\nfor quite some time.\nBest of luck!\nEvery time this happened to me, I\nstruggled to figure out what to do. I\nknew that as the company grew, we\nwould need additional processes and\nsystems designed to coordinate the\ncompany’s operations at each larger\nsize. And yet I had also seen many\nstartups become ossified and\nbureaucratic out of a misplaced\ndesire to become “professional.”\nHaving no system at all was not an\noption for IMVU and is not an option\nfor you. There are so many ways for\na startup to fail. I’ve lived through\nthe overarchitecture failure, in which\nattempting to prevent all the various\nkinds of problems that could occur\nwound up delaying the company\nfrom putting out any product. I’ve\nseen companies fail the other way\nfrom the so-called Friendster effect,\nsuffering a high-profile technical\nfailure just when customer adoption\nis going wild. As a department\nexecutive, this outcome is worst of\nall, because the failure is both highprofile and attributable to a single\nfunction or department—yours. Not\nonly will the company fail, it will be\nyour fault.\nMost of the advice I’ve heard on\nthis topic has suggested a kind of\nsplit-the-difference approach (as in,\n“engage in a little planning, but not\ntoo much”). The problem with this\nwilly-nilly approach is that it’s hard\nto give any rationale for why we\nshould anticipate one particular\nproblem but ignore another. It can\nfeel like the boss is being capricious\nor arbitrary, and that feeds the\ncommon feeling that management’s\ndecisions conceal an ulterior motive.\nFor those being managed this way,\ntheir incentives are clear. If the boss\ntends to split the difference, the best\nway to influence the boss and get\nwhat you want is to take the most\nextreme position possible. For\nexample, if one group is advocating\nfor an extremely lengthy release\ncycle, say, an annual new product\nintroduction, you might choose to\nargue for an equally extremely short\nrelease cycle (perhaps weekly or\neven daily), knowing that the two\nopinions will be averaged out. Then,\nwhen the difference is split, you’re\nlikely to get an outcome closer to\nwhat you actually wanted in the first\nplace. Unfortunately, this kind of\narms race escalates. Rivals in\nanother camp are likely to do the\nsame thing. Over time, everyone will\ntake the most polarized positions\npossible, which makes splitting the\ndifference ever more difficult and\never less successful. Managers have\nto take responsibility for knowingly\nor inadvertently creating such\nincentives. Although it was not their\nintention to reward extreme\npolarization, that’s exactly what they\nare doing. Getting out of this trap\nrequires a significant shift in\nthinking.\nBUILDING AN ADAPTIVE\nORGANIZATION\nShould a startup invest in a training\nprogram for new employees? If you\nhad asked me a few years ago, I\nwould have laughed and said,\n“Absolutely not. Training programs\nare for big companies that can afford\nthem.” Yet at IMVU we wound up\nbuilding a training program that was\nso good, new hires were productive\non their first day of employment.\nWithin just a few weeks, those\nemployees were contributing at a\nhigh level. It required a huge effort to\nstandardize our work processes and\nprepare a curriculum of the concepts\nthat new employees should learn.\nEvery new engineer would be\nassigned a mentor, who would help\nthe new employee work through a\ncurriculum of systems, concepts, and\ntechniques he or she would need to\nbecome productive at IMVU. The\nperformance of the mentor and\nmentee were linked, so the mentors\ntook this education seriously.\nWhat is interesting, looking back\nat this example, is that we never\nstopped work and decided that we\nneeded to build a great training\nprogram. Instead, the training\nprogram evolved organically out of a\nmethodical approach to evolving our\no w n process. This process of\norientation was subject to constant\nexperimentation and revision so that\nit grew more effective—and less\nburdensome—over time.\nI call this building an adaptive\norganization, one that automatically\nadjusts its process and performance\nto current conditions.\nCan You Go Too Fast?\nSo far this book has emphasized the\nimportance of speed. Startups are in\na life-or-death struggle to learn how\nto build a sustainable business before\nthey run out of resources and die.\nHowever, focusing on speed alone\nwould be destructive. To work,\nstartups require built-in speed\nregulators that help teams find their\noptimal pace of work.\nWe saw an example of speed\nregulation in Chapter 9 with the use\nof the andon cord in systems such as\ncontinuous deployment. It is\nepitomized in the paradoxical Toyota\nproverb, “Stop production so that\nproduction never has to stop.” The\nkey to the andon cord is that it brings\nwork to a stop as soon as an\nuncorrectable quality problem\nsurfaces—which forces it to be\ninvestigated. This is one of the most\nimportant discoveries of the lean\nmanufacturing movement: you\ncannot trade quality for time. If you\nare causing (or missing) quality\nproblems now, the resulting defects\nwill slow you down later. Defects\ncause a lot of rework, low morale,\nand customer complaints, all of\nwhich slow progress and eat away at\nvaluable resources.\nSo far I have used the language of\nphysical products to describe these\nproblems, but that is simply a matter\nof convenience. Service businesses\nhave the same challenges. Just ask\nany manager of a training, staffing,\nor hospitality firm to show you the\nplaybook that specifies how\nemployees are supposed to deliver\nthe service under various conditions.\nWhat might have started out as a\nsimple guide tends to grow\ninexorably over time. Pretty soon,\norientation is incredibly complex and\nemployees have invested a lot of\ntime and energy in learning the rules.\nNow consider an entrepreneurial\nmanager in that kind of company\ntrying to experiment with new rules\nor procedures. The higher-quality the\nexisting playbook is, the easier it will\nbe for it to evolve over time. By\ncontrast, a low-quality playbook will\nbe filled with contradictory or\nambiguous rules that cause\nconfusion when anything is changed.\nWhen I teach the Lean Startup\napproach to entrepreneurs with an\nengineering background, this is one\nof the hardest concepts to grasp. On\nthe one hand, the logic of validated\nlearning and the minimum viable\nproduct says that we should get a\nproduct into customers’ hands as\nsoon as possible and that any extra\nwork we do beyond what is required\nto learn from customers is waste. On\nthe other hand, the Build-MeasureLearn feedback loop is a continuous\nprocess. We don’t stop after one\nminimum viable product but use\nwhat we have learned to get to work\nimmediately on the next iteration.\nTherefore, shortcuts taken in\nproduct quality, design, or\ninfrastructure today may wind up\nslowing a company down tomorrow.\nYou can see this paradox in action at\nIMVU. Chapter 3 recounted how we\nwound up shipping a product to\ncustomers that was full of bugs,\nmissing features, and bad design.\nThe customers wouldn’t even try that\nproduct, and so most of that work\nhad to be thrown away. It’s a good\nthing we didn’t waste a lot of time\nfixing those bugs and cleaning up\nthat early version.\nHowever, as our learning allowed\nus to build products that customers\ndid want, we faced slowdowns.\nHaving a low-quality product can\ninhibit learning when the defects\nprevent customers from experiencing\n(and giving feedback on) the\nproduct’s benefits. In IMVU’s case,\nas we offered the product to more\nmainstream customers, they were\nmuch less forgiving than early\nadopters had been. Similarly, the\nmore features we added to the\nproduct, the harder it became to add\neven more because of the risk that a\nnew feature would interfere with an\nexisting feature. The same dynamics\nhappen in a service business, since\nany new rules may conflict with\nexisting rules, and the more rules, the\nmore possibilities for conflict.\nIMVU used the techniques of this\nchapter to achieve scale and quality\nin a just-in-time fashion.\nTHE WISDOM OF THE FIVE\nWHYS\nTo accelerate, Lean Startups need a\nprocess that provides a natural\nfeedback loop. When you’re going\ntoo fast, you cause more problems.\nAdaptive processes force you to slow\ndown and invest in preventing the\nkinds of problems that are currently\nwasting time. As those preventive\nefforts pay off, you naturally speed\nup again.\nLet’s return to the question of\nhaving a training program for new\nemployees. Without a program, new\nemployees will make mistakes while\nin their learning curve that will\nrequire assistance and intervention\nfrom other team members, slowing\neveryone down. How do you decide\nif the investment in training is worth\nthe benefit of speed due to reduced\ninterruptions? Figuring this out from\na top-down perspective is\nchallenging, because it requires\nestimating two completely unknown\nquantities: how much it will cost to\nbuild an unknown program against\nan unknown benefit you might reap.\nEven worse, the traditional way to\nmake these kinds of decisions is\ndecidedly large-batch thinking. A\ncompany either has an elaborate\ntraining program or it does not. Until\nthey can justify the return on\ninvestment from building a full\nprogram, most companies generally\ndo nothing.\nThe alternative is to use a system\ncalled the Five Whys to make\nincremental investments and evolve\na startup’s processes gradually. The\ncore idea of Five Whys is to tie\ninvestments directly to the\nprevention of the most problematic\nsymptoms. The system takes its\nname from the investigative method\nof asking the question “Why?” five\ntimes to understand what has\nhappened (the root cause). If you’ve\never had to answer a precocious\nchild who wants to know “Why is\nthe sky blue?” and keeps asking\n“Why?” after each answer, you’re\nfamiliar with it. This technique was\ndeveloped as a systematic problemsolving tool by Taiichi Ohno, the\nfather of the Toyota Production\nSystem. I have adapted it for use in\nthe Lean Startup model with a few\nchanges designed specifically for\nstartups.\nAt the root of every seemingly\ntechnical problem is a human\nproblem. Five Whys provides an\nopportunity to discover what that\nhuman problem might be. Taiichi\nOhno gives the following example:\nWhen confronted with a\nproblem, have you ever stopped\nand asked why five times? It is\ndifficult to do even though it\nsounds easy. For example,\nsuppose a machine stopped\nfunctioning:\n1. Why did the machine stop?\n(There was an overload and\nthe fuse blew.)\n2. Why was there an overload?\n(The bearing was not\nsufficiently lubricated.)\n3. Why was it not lubricated\nsufficiently? (The lubrication\npump was not pumping\nsufficiently.)\n4. Why was it not pumping\nsufficiently? (The shaft of the\npump was worn and rattling.)\n5. Why was the shaft worn out?\n(There was no strainer\nattached and metal scrap got\nin.)\nRepeating “why” five times,\nlike this, can help uncover the\nroot problem and correct it. If\nthis procedure were not carried\nthrough, one might simply\nreplace the fuse or the pump\nshaft. In that case, the problem\nwould recur within a few\nmonths. The Toyota production\nsystem has been built on the\npractice and evolution of this\nscientific approach. By asking\nand answering “why” five\ntimes, we can get to the real\ncause of the problem, which is\noften hidden behind more\nobvious symptoms.1\nNote that even in Ohno’s\nrelatively simple example the root\ncause moves away from a technical\nfault (a blown fuse) and toward a\nhuman error (someone forgot to\nattach a strainer). This is completely\ntypical of most problems that\nstartups face no matter what industry\nthey are in. Going back to our\nservice business example, most\nproblems that at first appear to be\nindividual mistakes can be traced\nback to problems in training or the\noriginal playbook for how the service\nis to be delivered.\nLet me demonstrate how using the\nFive Whys allowed us to build the\nemployee training system that was\nmentioned earlier. Imagine that at\nIMVU we suddenly start receiving\ncomplaints from customers about a\nnew version of the product that we\nhave just released.\n1. A new release disabled a\nfeature for customers. Why?\nBecause a particular server\nfailed.\n2. Why did the server fail?\nBecause an obscure\nsubsystem was used in the\nwrong way.\n3. Why was it used in the wrong\nway? The engineer who used\nit didn’t know how to use it\nproperly.\n4. Why didn’t he know?\nBecause he was never\ntrained.\n5. Why wasn’t he trained?\nBecause his manager doesn’t\nb e l i e v e in training new\nengineers because he and his\nteam are “too busy.”\nWhat began as a purely technical\nfault is revealed quickly to be a very\nhuman managerial issue.\nMake a Proportional Investment\nHere’s how to use Five Whys\nanalysis to build an adaptive\norganization: consistently make a\nproportional investment at each of\nthe five levels of the hierarchy. In\nother words, the investment should\nbe smaller when the symptom is\nminor and larger when the symptom\nis more painful. We don’t make large\ninvestments in prevention unless\nwe’re coping with large problems.\nIn the example above, the answer\nis to fix the server, change the\nsubsystem to make it less errorprone, educate the engineer, and,\nyes, have a conversation with the\nengineer’s manager.\nThis latter piece, the conversation\nwith the manager, is always hard,\nespecially in a startup. When I was a\nstartup manager, if you told me I\nneeded to invest in training my\npeople, I would have told you it was\na waste of time. There were always\ntoo many other things to do. I’d\nprobably have said something\nsarcastic like “Sure, I’d be happy to\ndo that—if you can spare my time\nfor the eight weeks it’ll take to set\nup.” That’s manager-speak for “No\nway in hell.”\nThat’s why the proportional\ninvestment approach is so important.\nIf the outage is a minor glitch, it’s\nessential that we make only a minor\ninvestment in fixing it. Let’s do the\nfirst hour of the eight-week plan.\nThat may not sound like much, but\nit’s a start. If the problem recurs,\nasking the Five Whys will require\nthat we continue to make progress on\nit. If the problem does not occur\nagain, an hour isn’t a big loss.\nI used the example of engineering\ntraining because that was something\nI was reluctant to invest in at IMVU.\nAt the outset of our venture, I\nthought we needed to focus all of our\nenergies on building and marketing\nour product. Yet once we entered a\nperiod of rapid hiring, repeated Five\nWhys sessions revealed that\nproblems caused by lack of training\nwere slowing down product\ndevelopment. At no point did we\ndrop everything to focus solely on\ntraining. Instead, we made\nincremental improvements to the\nprocess constantly, each time reaping\nincremental benefits. Over time,\nthose changes compounded, freeing\nup time and energy that previously\nhad been lost to firefighting and\ncrisis management.\nAutomatic Speed Regulator\nThe Five Whys approach acts as a\nnatural speed regulator. The more\nproblems you have, the more you\ninvest in solutions to those problems.\nAs the investments in infrastructure\nor process pay off, the severity and\nnumber of crises are reduced and the\nteam speeds up again. With startups\nin particular, there is a danger that\nteams will work too fast, trading\nquality for time in a way that causes\nsloppy mistakes. Five Whys prevents\nthat, allowing teams to find their\noptimal pace.\nThe Five Whys ties the rate of\nprogress to learning, not just\nexecution. Startup teams should go\nthrough the Five Whys whenever\nthey encounter any kind of failure,\nincluding technical faults, failures to\nachieve business results, or\nunexpected changes in customer\nbehavior.\nFive Whys is a powerful\norganizational technique. Some of\nthe engineers I have trained to use it\nbelieve that you can derive all the\nother Lean Startup techniques from\nthe Five Whys. Coupled with\nworking in small batches, it provides\nthe foundation a company needs to\nrespond quickly to problems as they\nappear, without overinvesting or\noverengineering.\nTHE CURSE OF THE FIVE\nBLAMES\nWhen teams first adopt Five Whys\nas a problem-solving tool, they\nencounter some common pitfalls. We\nneed systems like Five Whys to\novercome our psychological\nlimitations because we tend to\noverreact to what’s happening in the\nmoment. We also tend to get\nfrustrated if things happen that we\ndid not anticipate.\nWhen the Five Whys approach\ngoes awry, I call it the Five Blames.\nInstead of asking why repeatedly in\nan attempt to understand what went\nwrong, frustrated teammates start\npointing fingers at each other, trying\nto decide who is at fault. Instead of\nusing the Five Whys to find and fix\nproblems, managers and employees\ncan fall into the trap of using the\nFive Blames as a means for venting\ntheir frustrations and calling out\ncolleagues for systemic failures.\nAlthough it’s human nature to\nassume that when we see a mistake,\nit’s due to defects in someone else’s\ndepartment, knowledge, or character,\nthe goal of the Five Whys is to help\nus see the objective truth that chronic\nproblems are caused by bad process,\nnot bad people, and remedy them\naccordingly.\nI recommend several tactics for\nescaping the Five Blames. The first\nis to make sure that everyone\naffected by the problem is in the\nroom during the analysis of the root\ncause. The meeting should include\nanyone who discovered or diagnosed\nthe problem, including customer\nservice representatives who fielded\nthe calls, if possible. It should\ninclude anyone who tried to fix the\nsymptom as well as anyone who\nworked on the subsystems or\nfeatures involved. If the problem was\nescalated to senior management, the\ndecision makers who were involved\nin the escalation should be present as\nwell.\nThis may make for a crowded\nroom, but it’s essential. In my\nexperience, whoever is left out of the\ndiscussion ends up being the target\nfor blame. This is just as damaging\nwhether the scapegoat is a junior\nemployee or the CEO. When it’s a\njunior employee, it’s all too easy to\nbelieve that that person is\nreplaceable. If the CEO is not\npresent, it’s all too easy to assume\nthat his or her behavior is\nunchangeable. Neither presumption\nis usually correct.\nWhen blame inevitably arises, the\nmost senior people in the room\nshould repeat this mantra: if a\nmistake happens, shame on us for\nmaking it so easy to make that\nmistake. In a Five Whys analysis, we\nwant to have a systems-level view as\nmuch as possible.\nHere’s a situation in which this\nmantra came in handy. Because of\nthe training process we had\ndeveloped at IMVU through the Five\nWhys, we routinely asked new\nengineers to make a change to the\nproduction environment on their first\nday. For engineers trained in\ntraditional development methods,\nthis was often frightening. They\nwould ask, “What will happen to me\nif I accidentally disrupt or stop the\nproduction process?” In their\nprevious jobs, that was a mistake that\ncould get them fired. At IMVU we\ntold new hires, “If our production\nprocess is so fragile that you can\nbreak it on your very first day of\nwork, shame on us for making it so\neasy to do so.” If they did manage to\nbreak it, we immediately would have\nthem lead the effort to fix the\nproblem as well as the effort to\nprevent the next person from\nrepeating their mistake.\nFor new hires who came from\ncompanies with a very different\nculture, this was often a stressful\ninitiation, but everyone came through\nit with a visceral understanding of\nour values. Bit by bit, system by\nsystem, those small investments\nadded up to a robust product\ndevelopment process that allowed all\nour employees to work more\ncreatively, with greatly reduced fear.\nGetting Started\nHere are a few tips on how to get\nstarted with the Five Whys that are\nbased on my experience introducing\nthis technique at many other\ncompanies.\nFor the Five Whys to work\nproperly, there are rules that must be\nfollowed. For example, the Five\nWhys requires an environment of\nmutual trust and empowerment. In\nsituations in which this is lacking,\nthe complexity of Five Whys can be\noverwhelming. In such situations,\nI’ve often used a simplified version\nthat still allows teams to focus on\nanalyzing root causes while\ndeveloping the muscles they’ll need\nlater to tackle the full-blown method.\nI ask teams to adopt these simple\nrules:\n1. Be tolerant of all mistakes the\nfirst time.\n2. Never allow the same\nmistake to be made twice.\nThe first rule encourages people to\nget used to being compassionate\nabout mistakes, especially the\nmistakes of others. Remember, most\nmistakes are caused by flawed\nsystems, not bad people. The second\nrule gets the team started making\nproportional investments in\nprevention.\nThis simplified system works\nwell. In fact, we used it at IMVU in\nthe days before I discovered the Five\nWhys and the Toyota Production\nSystem. However, such a simplified\nsystem does not work effectively\nover the long term, as I found out\nfirsthand. In fact, that was one of the\nthings that drove me to first learn\nabout lean production.\nThe strength and weakness of the\nsimplified system is that it invites\nquestions such as What counts as the\nsame problem? What kinds of\nmistakes should we focus on? and\nShould we fix this individual\nproblem or try to prevent a whole\ncategory of related problems? For a\nteam that is just getting started, these\nquestions are thought-provoking and\ncan lay the groundwork for more\nelaborate methods to come.\nUltimately, though, they do need\nanswering. They need a complete\nadaptive process such as the Five\nWhys.\nFacing Unpleasant Truths\nYou will need to be prepared for the\nfact that Five Whys is going to turn\nup unpleasant facts about your\norganization, especially at the\nbeginning. It is going to call for\ninvestments in prevention that come\nat the expense of time and money\nthat could be invested in new\nproducts or features. Under pressure,\nteams may feel that they don’t have\ntime to waste on analyzing root\ncauses even though it would give\nthem more time in the long term. The\nprocess sometimes will devolve into\nthe Five Blames. At all these\njunctures, it is essential that someone\nwith sufficient authority be present to\ninsist that the process be followed,\nthat its recommendations be\nimplemented, and to act as a referee\nif disagreements flare up. Building\nan adaptive organization, in other\nwords, requires executive leadership\nto sponsor and support the process.\nOften, individual contributors at\nstartups come to my workshops,\neager to get started with the Five\nWhys. I caution against attempting to\ndo that if they do not have the buy-in\nof the manager or team leader.\nProceed cautiously if you find\nyourself in this situation. It may not\nbe possible to get the entire team\ntogether for a true Five Whys\ninquiry, but you can always follow\nthe simple two-rule version in your\nown work. Whenever something\ngoes wrong, ask yourself: How could\nI prevent myself from being in this\nsituation ever again?\nStart Small, Be Specific\nOnce you are ready to begin, I\nrecommend starting with a narrowly\ntargeted class of symptoms. For\nexample, the first time I used the\nFive Whys successfully, I used it to\ndiagnose problems with one of our\ninternal testing tools that did not\naffect customers directly. It may be\ntempting to start with something\nlarge and important because that is\nwhere most of the time is being\nwasted as a result of a flawed\nprocess, but it is also where the\npressure will be greatest. When the\nstakes are high, the Five Whys can\ndevolve into the Five Blames\nquickly. It’s better to give the team a\nchance to learn how to do the\nprocess first and then expand into\nhigher-stakes areas later.\nThe more specific the symptoms\nare, the easier it will be for everyone\nto recognize when it’s time to\nschedule a Five Whys meeting. Say\nyou want to use the Five Whys to\naddress billing complaints from\ncustomers. In that case, pick a date\nafter which all billing complaints\nwill trigger a Five Whys meeting\nautomatically. Note that this requires\nthat there be a small enough volume\nof complaints that having this\nmeeting every time one comes in is\npractical. If there are already too\nmany complaints, pick a subset on\nwhich you want to focus. Make sure\nthat the rule that determines which\nkinds of complaints trigger a Five\nWhys meeting is simple and\nironclad. For example, you might\ndecide that every complaint\ninvolving a credit card transaction\nwill be investigated. That’s an easy\nrule to follow. Don’t pick a rule that\nis ambiguous.\nAt first, the temptation may be to\nmake radical and deep changes to\nevery billing system and process.\nDon’t. Instead, keep the meetings\nshort and pick relatively simple\nchanges at each of the five levels of\nthe inquiry. Over time, as the team\ngets more comfortable with the\nprocess, you can expand it to include\nmore and more types of billing\ncomplaints and then to other kinds of\nproblems.\nAppoint a Five Whys Master\nTo facilitate learning, I have found it\nhelpful to appoint a Five Whys\nmaster for each area in which the\nmethod is being used. This\nindividual is tasked with being the\nmoderator for each Five Whys\nmeeting, making decisions about\nwhich prevention steps to take, and\nassigning the follow-up work from\nthat meeting. The master must be\nsenior enough to have the authority\nto ensure that those assignments get\ndone but should not be so senior that\nhe or she will not be able to be\npresent at the meetings because of\nconflicting responsibilities. The Five\nWhys master is the point person in\nterms of accountability; he or she is\nthe primary change agent. People in\nthis position can assess how well the\nmeetings are going and whether the\nprevention investments that are being\nmade are paying off.\nTHE FIVE WHYS IN ACTION\nIGN Entertainment, a division of\nNews Corporation, is an online video\ngames media company with the\nbiggest audience of video game\nplayers in the world. More than 45\nmillion gamers frequent its portfolio\nof media properties. IGN was\nfounded in the late 1990s, and News\nCorporation acquired it in 2005. IGN\nhas grown to employ several\nhundred people, including almost a\nhundred engineers.\nRecently, I had the opportunity to\nspeak to the product development\nteam at IGN. They had been\nsuccessful in recent years, but like all\nthe established companies we’ve\nseen throughout this book, they were\nlooking to accelerate new product\ndevelopment and find ways to be\nmore innovative. They brought\ntogether their engineering, product,\nand design teams to talk through\nways they could apply the Lean\nStartup model.\nThis change initiative had the\nsupport of IGN’s senior\nmanagement, including the CEO, the\nhead of product development, the\nvice president of engineering, the\npublisher, and the head of product.\nTheir previous efforts at Five Whys\nhad not gone smoothly. They had\nattempted to tackle a laundry list of\nproblem areas nominated by the\nproduct team. The issues varied from\ndiscrepancies in web analytics to\npartner data feeds that were not\nworking. Their first Five Whys\nmeeting took an hour, and although\nthey came up with some interesting\ntakeaways, as far as the Five Whys\ngoes, it was a disaster. None of the\npeople who were connected to and\nknew the most about the issues were\nat the meeting, and because this was\nthe first time they were doing the\nFive Whys together, they didn’t stick\nto the format and went off on many\ntangents. It wasn’t a complete waste\nof time, but it didn’t have any of the\nbenefits of the adaptive style of\nmanagement discussed in this\nchapter.\nDon’t Send Your Baggage through\nthe Five Whys Process\nIGN had the experience of trying to\nsolve all of its “baggage” issues that\nhad been causing wasted time for\nmany years. Because this is an\noverwhelming set of problems,\nfinding fixes quickly proves\noverwhelming.\nIn their zeal to get started with the\nFive Whys, IGN neglected three\nimportant things:\n1. To introduce Five Whys to an\norganization, it is necessary\nto hold Five Whys sessions\nas new problems come up.\nSince baggage issues are\nendemic, they naturally come\nup as part of the Five Whys\nanalysis and you can take that\nopportunity to fix them\nincrementally. If they don’t\ncome up organically, maybe\nthey’re not as big as they\nseem.\n2. Everyone who is connected\nto a problem needs to be at\nthe Five Whys session. Many\norganizations face the\ntemptation to save time by\nsparing busy people from the\nroot cause analysis. This is a\nfalse economy, as IGN\ndiscovered the hard way.\n3. At the beginning of each Five\nWhys session, take a few\nminutes to explain what the\nprocess is for and how it\nworks for the benefit of those\nwho are new to it. If possible,\nuse an example of a\nsuccessful Five Whys session\nfrom the past. If you’re brand\nnew, you can use my earlier\nexample about the manager\nwho doesn’t believe in\ntraining. IGN learned that,\nwhenever possible, it helps to\nuse something that has\npersonal meaning for the\nteam.\nAfter our meeting, the IGN\nleadership decided to give Five\nWhys another try. Following the\nadvice laid out in this chapter, they\nappointed a Five Whys master\nnamed Tony Ford, a director of\nengineering. Tony was an\nentrepreneur who had come to IGN\nthrough an acquisition. He got his\nstart with Internet technology,\nbuilding websites about video games\nin the late 1990s. Eventually that led\nto an opportunity at a startup,\nTeamXbox, where he served as the\nlead software developer. TeamXbox\nwas acquired by IGN Entertainment\nin 2003, and since that time Tony has\nbeen a technologist, leader of\ninnovation, and proponent of agile\nand lean practices there.\nUnfortunately, Tony started\nwithout picking a narrow problem\narea on which to focus. This led to\nearly setbacks and frustration. Tony\nrelates, “As the new master I wasn’t\nvery good at traversing through the\nFive Whys effectively, and the\nproblems we were trying to solve\nwere not great candidates in the first\nplace. As you can imagine, these\nearly sessions were awkward and in\nthe end not very useful. I was getting\nquite discouraged and frustrated.”\nThis is a common problem when one\ntries to tackle too much at once, but\nit is also a consequence of the fact\nthat these skills take time to master.\nLuckily, Tony persevered: “Having a\nFive Whys master is critical in my\nopinion. Five Whys is easy in theory\nbut difficult in practice, so you need\nsomeone who knows it well to shape\nthe sessions for those who don’t.”\nThe turnaround came when Tony\nled a Five Whys session involving a\nproject that had been missing its\ndeadlines. The session was\nfascinating and insightful and\nproduced meaningful proportional\ninvestments. Tony explains: “The\nsuccess had to do with a more\nexperienced master and more\nexperienced attendees. We all knew\nwhat the Five Whys was, and I did a\nreally good job keeping us on track\nand away from tangents. This was a\npivotal moment. Right then I knew\nthe Five Whys was a new tool that\nwas going to have a real impact on\nour overall success as a team and as\na business.”\nOn the surface, Five Whys seems\nto be about technical problems and\npreventing mistakes, but as teams\ndrive out these superficial wastes,\nthey develop a new understanding of\nhow to work together. Tony put it\nthis way: “I daresay that I discovered\nthat the Five Whys transcends root\ncause analysis by revealing\ninformation that brings your team\ncloser through a common\nunderstanding and perspective. A lot\nof times a problem can pull people\napart; Five Whys does the opposite.”\nI asked Tony to provide an\nexample of a recent successful Five\nWhys analysis from IGN. His\naccount of it is listed in the sidebar.\nWhy couldn’t you add or edit posts\non the blogs?\nAnswer: Any post request (write) to\nthe article content api was returning\na 500 error.\nProportional investment: Jim—\nWe’ll work on the API, but let’s\nmake our CMS more forgiving for\nthe user. Allow users to add and edit\ndrafts without errors for a better user\nexperience.\nWhy was the content API\nreturning 500 errors?\nAnswer: The bson_ext gem was\nincompatible with other gems it\ndepends upon.\nProportional investment: King—\nRemove the gem (already done to\nresolve the outage).\nWhy was the gem incompatible?\nAnswer: We added a new version of\nthe gem in addition to the existing\nversion and the app started using it\nunexpectedly.\nProportional investment: Bennett—\nConvert our rails app to use bundler\nfor gem management.\nWhy did we add a new version of a\ngem in production without testing?\nAnswer: We didn’t think we needed\na test in these cases.\nProportional investment: Bennett\nand Jim—Write a unit or functional\ntest in the API and CMS that will\ncatch this in the future.\nWhy do we add additional gems\nthat we don’t intend to use right\naway?\nAnswer: In preparation for a code\npush we wanted to get all new gems\nready in the production environment.\nEven though our code deployments\nare fully automated, gems are not.\nProportional investment: Bennett—\nAutomate gem management and\ninstallation into Continuous\nIntegration and Continuous\nDeployment process.\nBonus—Why are we doing things\nin production on Friday nights?\nAnswer: Because no one says we\ncan’t and it was a convenient time\nfor the developer to prepare for a\ndeployment we’d be doing on\nMonday.\nProportional investment: Tony—\nMake an announcement to the team.\nThere will be no production changes\non Friday, Saturday, or Sunday\nunless an exception has been made\nand approved by David (VP\nEngineering). We will reevaluate this\npolicy when we have a fully\nautomated continuous deployment\nprocess in place.\nAs a result of this Five Whys session\nand the proportional investments we\nmade, our deployments are easier,\nquicker, and never again will our\nprocess allow a developer to place\ngems into production systems with\nunintended consequences. Indeed,\nwe have not had another issue like\nthis. We strengthened our “cluster\nimmune system” as you would say.\nWithout the Five Whys, we would\nhave never discovered all of the\ninformation we did here. My guess is\nthat we would have told that one\ndeveloper to not do stupid things on\nFriday nights and moved on. This is\nwhat I emphasized earlier, where a\ngood Five Whys session has two\noutputs, learning and doing. The\nproportional investments that came\nout of this session are obviously\nvaluable, but the learnings are much\nmore subtle, but amazing for\ngrowing as developers and as a team.\nADAPTING TO SMALLER\nBATCHES\nBefore leaving the topic of building\nan adaptive organization, I want to\nintroduce one more story. This one\nconcerns a product that you’ve\nprobably used if you’ve ever run\nyour own business. It’s called\nQuickBooks, and it is one of Intuit’s\nflagship products.\nQuickBooks has been the leading\nproduct in its category for many\nyears. As a result, it has a large and\ndedicated customer base, and Intuit\nexpects it to contribute significantly\nto its bottom line. Like most personal\ncomputer (PC) software of the last\ntwo decades, QuickBooks has been\nlaunched on an annual cycle, in one\ngiant batch. This was how it worked\nthree years ago, when Greg Wright,\nthe director of product marketing for\nQuickBooks, joined the team. As\nyou can imagine, there were lots of\nexisting processes in place to ensure\na consistent product and an on-time\nrelease. The typical release approach\nwas to spend significant up-front\ntime to identify the customers’ need:\nTypically the first three to four\nmonths of each annual cycle\nwas spent strategizing and\nplanning, without building new\nfeatures. Once a plan and\nmilestones were established, the\nteam would spend the next six\nto nine months building. This\nwould culminate in a big\nlaunch, and then the team would\nget its first feedback on whether\nit had successfully delivered on\ncustomers’ needs at the end of\nthe process.\nSo here was the time line:\nstart process in September, first\nbeta release is in June, second\nbeta is in July. The beta is\nessentially testing to make sure\nit doesn’t crash people’s\ncomputers or cause them to lose\ntheir data—by that time in the\nprocess, only major bugs can be\nfixed. The design of the product\nitself is locked.\nThis is the standard “waterfall”\ndevelopment methodology that\nproduct development teams have\nused for years. It is a linear, largebatch system that relies for success\non proper forecasting and planning.\nIn other words, it is completely\nmaladapted for today’s rapidly\nchanging business environment.\nYear One: Achieving Failure\nGreg witnessed this breakdown in\n2009, his first year on the\nQuickBooks team. That year, the\ncompany shipped an entirely new\nsystem in QuickBooks for online\nbanking, one of its most important\nfeatures. The team went through\nrounds of usability testing using\nmock-ups and nonfunctional\nprototypes, followed by significant\nbeta testing using sample customer\ndata. At the moment of the launch,\neverything looked good.\nThe first beta release was in June,\nand customer feedback started\ncoming in negative. Although\ncustomers were complaining, there\nwasn’t sufficient cause to stop the\nrelease because it was technically\nflawless—it didn’t crash computers.\nAt that point, Greg was in a bind. He\nhad no way of knowing how the\nfeedback would translate to real\ncustomer behavior in the market.\nWere these just isolated complaints,\nor part of a widespread problem? He\ndid know one thing for sure, though:\nthat his team could not afford to miss\nthe deadline.\nWhen the product finally shipped,\nthe results were terrible. It took\ncustomers four to five times longer\nto reconcile their banking\ntransactions than it had with the\nolder version. In the end, Greg’s\nteam had failed to deliver on the\ncustomer need they were trying to\naddress (despite building the product\nto specification), and because the\nnext release had to go through the\nsame waterfall process, it took the\nteam nine months to fix. This is a\nclassic case of “achieving failure”—\nsuccessfully executing a flawed plan.\nIntuit uses a tracking survey called\nthe Net Promoter Score2 to evaluate\ncustomer satisfaction with its many\nproducts. This is a great source of\nactionable metrics about what\ncustomers really think about a\nproduct. In fact, I used it at IMVU,\ntoo. One thing that is nice about NPS\nis that it is very stable over time.\nSince it is measuring core customer\nsatisfaction, it is not subject to minor\nfluctuations; it registers only major\nchanges in customer sentiment. That\nyear, the QuickBooks score dropped\n20 points, the first time the company\nhad ever moved the needle with the\nNet Promoter Score. That 20-point\ndrop resulted in significant losses for\nIntuit and was embarrassing for the\ncompany—all because customer\nfeedback came too late in the\nprocess, allowing no time to iterate.\nIntuit’s senior management,\nincluding the general manager of the\nsmall business division and the head\nof small business accounting,\nrecognized the need for change. To\ntheir credit, they tasked Greg with\ndriving that change. His mission: to\nachieve startup speed for the\ndevelopment and deployment of\nQuickBooks.\nYear Two: Muscle Memory\nThe next chapter of this story\nillustrates how hard it is to build an\nadaptive organization. Greg set out\nto change the QuickBooks\ndevelopment process by using four\nprinciples:\n1. Smaller teams. Shift from\nlarge teams with uniform\nfunctional roles to smaller,\nfully engaged teams whose\nmembers take on different\nroles.\n2. Achieve shorter cycle times.\n3. Faster customer feedback,\ntesting both whether it\ncrashes customers’\ncomputers and the\nperformance of new\nfeatures/customer experience.\n4. Enable and empower teams\nto make fast and courageous\ndecisions.\nOn the surface, these goals seem\nto be aligned with the methods and\nprinciples described in previous\nchapters, but Greg’s second year\nwith QuickBooks was not a marked\nsuccess. For example, he decreed\nthat the team would move to a\nm i d y e a r release milestone,\neffectively cutting the cycle time and\nbatch size in half. However, this was\nnot successful. Through sheer\ndetermination, the team tried\nvaliantly to get an alpha release out\nin January. However, the problems\nthat afflict large-batch development\nwere still present, and the team\nstruggled to complete the alpha by\nApril. That represented an\nimprovement over the past system\nbecause issues could be brought to\nthe surface two months earlier than\nunder the old way, but it did not\nproduce the dramatically better\nresults Greg was looking for.\nIn fact, over the course of the year,\nthe team’s process kept looking more\nand more like it had in prior years.\nAs Greg put it, “Organizations have\nmuscle memory,” and it is hard for\npeople to unlearn old habits. Greg\nwas running up against a system, and\nmaking individual changes such as\narbitrarily changing the release date\nwere no match for it.\nYear Three: Explosion\nFrustrated by the limited progress in\nthe previous year, Greg teamed up\nwith the product development leader\nHimanshu Baxi. Together they\ntossed out all the old processes. They\nmade a public declaration that their\ncombined teams would be creating\nnew processes and that they were not\ngoing to go back to the old way.\nInstead of focusing on new\ndeadlines, Greg and Himanshu\ninvested in process, product, and\ntechnology changes that enabled\nworking in smaller batches. Those\ntechnical innovations helped them\nget the desktop product to customers\nfaster for feedback. Instead of\nbuilding a comprehensive road map\nat the beginning of the year, Greg\nkicked off the year with what they\ncalled idea/code/solution jams that\nbrought engineers, product\nmanagers, and customers together to\ncreate a pipeline of ideas. It was\nscary for Greg as a product manager\nto start the year without a defined list\nof what would be in the product\nrelease, but he had confidence in his\nteam and the new process.\nThere were three differences in\nyear three:\n• Teams were involved in\ncreating new technologies,\nprocesses, and systems.\n• Cross-functional teams were\nformed around new great\nideas.\n• Customers were involved from\nthe inception of each feature\nconcept.\nIt’s important to understand that\nthe old approach did not lack\ncustomer feedback or customer\ninvolvement in the planning process.\nIn the true spirit of genchi gembutsu,\nIntuit product managers (PMs)\nwould do “follow-me-homes” with\ncustomers to identify problems to\nsolve in the next release. However,\nthe PMs were responsible for all the\ncustomer research. They would bring\nit back to the team and say, “This is\nthe problem we want to solve, and\nhere are ideas for how we could\nsolve it.”\nChanging to a cross-functional\nway of working was not smooth\nsailing. Some team members were\nskeptical. For example, some product\nmanagers felt that it was a waste of\ntime for engineers to spend time in\nfront of customers. The PMs thought\nthat their job was to figure out the\ncustomer issue and define what\nneeded to be built. Thus, the reaction\nof some PMs to the change was:\n“What’s my job? What am I\nsupposed to be doing?” Similarly,\nsome on the engineering side just\nwanted to be told what to do; they\ndidn’t want to talk to customers. As\nis typically the case in large-batch\ndevelopment, both groups had been\nwilling to sacrifice the team’s ability\nto learn in order to work more\n“efficiently.”\nCommunication was critical for\nthis change process to succeed. All\nthe team leaders were open about the\nchange they were driving and why\nthey were driving it. Much of the\nskepticism they faced was based on\nthe fact that they did not have\nconcrete examples of where this had\nworked in the past; it was an entirely\nnew process for Intuit. They had to\nexplain clearly why the old process\ndidn’t work and why the annual\nrelease “train” was not setting them\nup for success. Throughout the\nchange they communicated the\nprocess outcomes they were shooting\nfor: earlier customer feedback and a\nfaster development cycle that was\ndecoupled from the annual release\ntime line. They repeatedly\nemphasized that the new approach\nwas how startup competitors were\nworking and iterating. They had to\nfollow suit or risk becoming\nirrelevant.\nHistorically, QuickBooks had been\nbuilt with large teams and long cycle\ntimes. For example, in earlier years\nthe ill-fated online banking team had\nbeen composed of fifteen engineers,\nseven quality assurance specialists, a\nproduct manager, and at times more\nthan one designer. Now no team is\nbigger than five people. The focus of\neach team is iterating with customers\nas rapidly as possible, running\nexperiments, and then using\nvalidated learning to make real-time\ninvestment decisions about what to\nwork on. As a result, whereas they\nused to have five major “branches”\nof QuickBooks that merged features\nat the time of the launch, now there\nare twenty to twenty-five branches.\nThis allows for a much larger set of\nexperiments. Each team works on a\nnew feature for approximately six\nweeks end to end, testing it with real\ncustomers throughout the process.\nAlthough the primary changes that\nare required in an adaptive\norganization are in the mind-set of its\nemployees, changing the culture is\nnot sufficient. As we saw in Chapter\n9, lean management requires treating\nwork as a system and then dealing\nwith the batch size and cycle time of\nthe whole process. Thus, to achieve\nlasting change, the QuickBooks team\nhad to invest in tools and platform\nchanges that would enable the new,\nfaster way of working.\nFor example, one of the major\nstress points in the attempt to release\nan early alpha version the previous\nyear was that QuickBooks is a\nmission-critical product. Many small\nbusinesses use it as their primary\nrepository for critical financial data.\nThe team was extremely wary of\nreleasing a minimum viable product\nthat had any risk of corrupting\ncustomer data. Therefore, even if\nthey worked in smaller teams with a\nsmaller scope, the burden of all that\nrisk would have made it hard to work\nin smaller batches.\nTo get the batch size down, the\nQuickBooks team had to invest in\nnew technology. They built a\nvirtualization system that allowed\nthem to run multiple versions of\nQuickBooks on a customer’s\ncomputer. The second version could\naccess all the customer’s data but\ncould not make permanent changes\nto it. Thus, there was no risk of the\nnew version corrupting the\ncustomer’s data by accident. This\nallowed them to isolate new releases\nto allow selected real customers to\ntest them and provide feedback.\nThe results in year three were\npromising. The version of\nQuickBooks that shipped that year\nhad significantly higher customer\nsatisfaction ratings and sold more\nunits. If you’re using QuickBooks\nright now, odds are you are using a\nversion that was built in small\nbatches. As Greg heads into his\nfourth year with the QuickBooks\nteam, they are exploring even more\nways to drive down batch size and\ncycle time. As usual, there are\npossibilities that go beyond technical\nsolutions. For example, the annual\nsales cycle of boxed desktop\nsoftware is a significant barrier to\ntruly rapid learning, and so the team\nhas begun experimenting with\nsubscription-based products for the\nmost active customers. With\ncustomers downloading updates\nonline, Intuit can release software on\na more frequent basis. Soon this\nprogram will see the QuickBooks\nteam releasing to customers\nquarterly.3\nAs Lean Startups grow, they can use\nadaptive techniques to develop more\ncomplex processes without giving up\ntheir core advantage: speed through\nthe Build-Measure-Learn feedback\nloop. In fact, one of the primary\nbenefits of using techniques that are\nderived from lean manufacturing is\nthat Lean Startups, when they grow\nup, are well positioned to develop\noperational excellence based on lean\nprinciples. They already know how\nto operate with discipline, develop\nprocesses that are tailor-made to\ntheir situation, and use lean\ntechniques such as the Five Whys\nand small batches. As a successful\nstartup makes the transition to an\nestablished company, it will be well\npoised to develop the kind of culture\nof disciplined execution that\ncharacterizes the world’s best firms,\nsuch as Toyota.\nHowever, successfully growing\ninto an established company is not\nthe end of the story. A startup’s work\nis never done, because as was\ndiscussed in Chapter 2, even\nestablished companies must struggle\nto find new sources of growth\nthrough disruptive innovation. This\nimperative is coming earlier in\ncompanies’ lives. No longer can a\nsuccessful startup expect to have\nyears after its initial public offering\nto bask in market-leading success.\nToday successful companies face\nimmediate pressure from new\ncompetitors, fast followers, and\nscrappy startups. As a result, it no\nlonger makes sense to think of\nstartups as going through discrete\nphases like the proverbial\nmetamorphosis of a caterpillar to a\nbutterfly. Both successful startups\nand established companies alike\nmust learn to juggle multiple kinds\nof work at the same time, pursuing\noperational excellence and disruptive\ninnovation. This requires a new kind\nof portfolio thinking, which is the\nsubject of Chapter 12.\n12\nINNOVATE\nConventional wisdom holds that\nwhen companies become larger, they\ninevitably lose the capacity for\ninnovation, creativity, and growth. I\nbelieve this is wrong. As startups\ngrow, entrepreneurs can build\norganizations that learn how to\nbalance the needs of existing\ncustomers with the challenges of\nfinding new customers to serve,\nmanaging existing lines of business,\nand exploring new business models\n—all at the same time. And, if they\nare willing to change their\nmanagement philosophy, I believe\neven large, established companies\ncan make this shift to what I call\nportfolio thinking.\nHOW TO NURTURE\nDISRUPTIVE INNOVATION\nSuccessful innovation teams must be\nstructured correctly in order to\nsucceed. Venture-backed and\nbootstrapped startups naturally have\nsome of these structural attributes as\na consequence of being small,\nindependent companies. Internal\nstartup teams require support from\nsenior management to create these\nstructures. Internal or external, in my\nexperience startup teams require\nthree structural attributes: scarce but\nsecure resources, independent\nauthority to develop their business,\nand a personal stake in the outcome.\nEach of these requirements is\ndifferent from those of established\ncompany divisions. Keep in mind\nthat structure is merely a prerequisite\n—it does not guarantee success. But\ngetting the structure wrong can lead\nto almost certain failure.\nScarce but Secure Resources\nDivision leaders in large, established\norganizations are adept at using\npolitics to enlarge their budgets but\nknow that those budgets are\nsomewhat loose. They often acquire\nas large a budget as possible and\nprepare to defend it against\nincursions from other departments.\nPolitics means that they sometimes\nwin and sometimes lose: if a crisis\nemerges elsewhere in the\norganization, their budget might\nsuddenly be reduced by 10 percent.\nThis is not a catastrophe; teams will\nhave to work harder and do more\nwith less. Most likely, the budget has\nsome padding in anticipation of this\nkind of eventuality.\nStartups are different: too much\nbudget is as harmful as too little—as\ncountless dot-com failures can attest\n—and startups are extremely\nsensitive to midcourse budgetary\nchanges. It is extremely rare for a\nstand-alone startup company to lose\n10 percent of its cash on hand\nsuddenly. In a large number of cases,\nthis would be a fatal blow, as\nindependent startups are run with\nlittle margin for error. Thus, startups\nare both easier and more demanding\nto run than traditional divisions: they\nrequire much less capital overall, but\nthat capital must be absolutely secure\nfrom tampering.\nIndependent Development\nAuthority\nStartup teams need complete\nautonomy to develop and market\nnew products within their limited\nmandate. They have to be able to\nconceive and execute experiments\nwithout having to gain an excessive\nnumber of approvals.\nI strongly recommend that startup\nteams be completely crossfunctional, that is, have full-time\nrepresentation from every functional\ndepartment in the company that will\nbe involved in the creation or launch\nof their early products. They have to\nbe able to build and ship actual\nfunctioning products and services,\nnot just prototypes. Handoffs and\napprovals slow down the BuildMeasure-Learn feedback loop and\ninhibit both learning and\naccountability. Startups require that\nthey be kept to an absolute\nminimum.\nOf course, this level of\ndevelopment autonomy is liable to\nraise fears in a parent organization.\nAlleviating those fears is a major\ngoal of the method recommended\nbelow.\nA Personal Stake in the Outcome\nThird, entrepreneurs need a personal\nstake in the outcome of their\ncreations. In stand-alone new\nventures, this usually is achieved\nthrough stock options or other forms\nof equity ownership. Where a bonus\nsystem must be used instead, the best\nincentives are tied to the long-term\nperformance of the new innovation.\nHowever, I do not believe that a\npersonal stake has to be financial.\nThis is especially important in\norganizations, such as nonprofits and\ngovernment, in which the innovation\nis not tied to financial objectives. In\nthese cases, it is still possible for\nteams to have a personal stake. The\nparent organization has to make it\nclear who the innovator is and make\nsure the innovator receives credit for\nhaving brought the new product to\nlife—if it is successful. As one\nentrepreneur who ran her own\ndivision at a major media company\ntold me, “Financial incentives aside,\nI always felt that because my name\nwas on the door, I had more to lose\nand more to prove than someone\nelse. That sense of ownership is not\ninsignificant.”\nThis formula is effective in forprofit companies as well. At Toyota,\nthe manager in charge of developing\na new vehicle from start to finish is\ncalled the shusa, or chief engineer:\nShusa are often called heavyweight project managers in the\nU.S. literature, but this name\nunderstates their real roles as\ndesign leaders. Toyota\nemployees translate the term as\nchief engineer, and they refer to\nthe vehicle under development\nas the shusa’s car. They assured\nus that the shusa has final,\nabsolute authority over every\naspect of vehicle development.1\nOn the flip side, I know an\nextremely high-profile technology\ncompany that has a reputation for\nhaving an innovative culture, yet its\ntrack record of producing new\nproducts is disappointing. The\ncompany boasts an internal reward\nsystem that is based on large\nfinancial and status awards to teams\nthat do something extraordinary, but\nthose awards are handed out by\nsenior management on the basis of—\nno one knows what. There are no\nobjective criteria by which a team\ncan gauge whether it will win this\ncoveted lottery. Teams have little\nconfidence that they will receive any\nlong-term ownership of their\ninnovations. Thus, teams rarely are\nmotivated to take real risks, instead\nfocusing their energies on projects\nthat are expected to win the approval\nof senior management.\nCREATING A PLATFORM FOR\nEXPERIMENTATION\nNext, it is important to focus on\nestablishing the ground rules under\nwhich autonomous startup teams\noperate: how to protect the parent\norganization, how to hold\nentrepreneurial managers\naccountable, and how to reintegrate\nan innovation back into the parent\norganization if it is successful.\nRecall the “island of freedom” that\nenabled the SnapTax team—in\nChapter 2—to successfully create a\nstartup within Intuit. That’s what a\nplatform for experimentation can do.\nProtecting the Parent Organization\nConventionally, advice about\ninternal innovators focuses on\nprotecting the startup from the parent\norganization. I believe it is necessary\nto turn this model on its head.\nLet me begin by describing a\nfairly typical meeting from one of\nmy consulting clients, a large\ncompany. Senior management had\ngathered to make decisions about\nwhat to include in the next version of\nits product. As part of the company’s\ncommitment to being data-driven, it\nhad tried to conduct an experiment\non pricing. The first part of the\nmeeting was taken up with\ninterpreting the data from the\nexperiment.\nOne problem was that nobody\ncould agree on what the data meant.\nMany custom reports had been\ncreated for the meeting; the data\nwarehouse team was at the meeting\ntoo. The more they were asked to\nexplain the details of each row on the\nspreadsheet, the more evident it\nbecame that nobody understood how\nthose numbers had been derived.\nWhat we were left looking at was the\nnumber of gross sales of the product\nat a variety of different price points,\nbroken down by quarter and by\ncustomer segment. It was a lot of\ndata to try to comprehend.\nWorse, nobody was sure which\ncustomers had been exposed to the\nexperiment. Different teams had\nbeen responsible for implementing it,\nand so different parts of the product\nhad been updated at different times.\nThe whole process had taken many\nmonths, and by this point, the people\nwho had conceived the experiment\nhad been moved to a division\nseparate from that of the people who\nhad executed it.\nYou should be able to spot the\nmany problems with this situation:\nthe use of vanity metrics instead of\nactionable metrics, an overly long\ncycle time, the use of large batch\nsizes, an unclear growth hypothesis,\na weak experimental design, a lack\nof team ownership, and therefore\nvery little learning.\nListening in, I assumed this would\nbe the end of the meeting. With no\nagreed-on facts to help make the\ndecision, I thought nobody would\nhave any basis for making the case\nfor a particular action. I was wrong.\nEach department simply took\nwhatever interpretation of the data\nsupported its position best and\nstarted advocating on its own behalf.\nOther departments would chime in\nwith alternative interpretations that\nsupported their positions, and so on.\nIn the end, decisions were not made\nbased on data. Instead, the executive\nrunning the meeting was forced to\nbase decisions on the most plausiblesounding arguments.\nIt seemed wasteful to me how\nmuch of the meeting had been spent\ndebating the data because, in the end,\nthe arguments that carried the day\ncould have been made right at the\nstart. It was as if each advocate\nsensed that he or she was about to be\nambushed; if another team managed\nto bring clarity to the situation, it\nmight undermine that person, and so\nthe rational response was to\nobfuscate as much as possible. What\na waste.\nIronically, meetings like this had\ngiven data-driven decision making\nand experimentation a bad name\ninside the company, and for good\nreason. The data warehousing team\nwas producing reports that nobody\nread or understood. The project\nteams felt the experiments were a\nwaste of time, since they involved\nbuilding features halfway, which\nmeant they were never any good.\n“Running an experiment” seemed to\nthem to be code for postponing a\nhard decision. Worst of all, the\nexecutive team experienced the\nmeetings as chronic headaches. Their\nold product prioritization meetings\nmight have been little more than a\nbattle of opinions, but at least the\nexecutives understood what was\ngoing on. Now they had to go\nthrough a ritual that involved\ncomplex math and reached no\ndefinite outcome, and then they\nended up having a battle of opinions\nanyway.\nRational Fears\nHowever, at the heart of this\ndepartmental feud was a very\nrational fear. This company served\ntwo customer segments: a businessto-business enterprise segment and a\nconsumer segment. In the B2B\nsegment, the company employed\nsales staff to sell large volumes of\nthe product to other companies,\nwhereas the consumer segment was\ndriven mostly by one-off purchases\nmade by individuals. The bulk of the\ncompany’s current revenue came\nfrom B2B sales, but growth in that\nsegment had been slowing. Everyone\nagreed there was tremendous\npotential for growth in the consumer\nsegment, but so far little had\nmaterialized.\nPart of the cause of this lack of\ngrowth was the current pricing\nstructure. Like many companies that\nsell to large enterprises, this one\npublished a high list price and then\nprovided heavy discounts to\n“favored” corporate clients who\nbought in bulk. Naturally, every\nsalesperson was encouraged to make\nall of his or her clients feel favored.\nUnfortunately, the published list\nprice was much too high for the\nconsumer segment.\nThe team in charge of growing the\nconsumer segment wanted to run\nexperiments with a lower price\nstructure. The team in charge of the\nenterprise segment was nervous that\nthis would cannibalize or otherwise\ndiminish its existing relationships\nwith its customers. What if those\ncustomers discovered that\nindividuals were getting a lower\nprice than they were?\nAnyone who has been in a\nmultisegment business will\nrecognize that there are many\npossible solutions to this problem,\nsuch as creating tiered feature sets so\nthat different customers are able to\npurchase different “levels” of the\nproduct (as in airline seating) or even\nsupporting different products under\nseparate brand names. Yet the\ncompany was struggling to\nimplement any of those solutions.\nWhy? Out of fear of endangering the\ncurrent business, each proposed\nexperiment would be delayed,\nsabotaged, and obfuscated.\nIt’s important to emphasize that\nthis fear is well founded. Sabotage is\na rational response from managers\nwhose territory is threatened. This\ncompany is not a random, tiny\nstartup with nothing to lose. An\nestablished company has a lot to\nlose. If the revenue from the core\nbusiness goes down, heads will roll.\nThis is not something to be taken\nlightly.\nThe Dangers of Hiding Innovation\ninside the Black Box\nThe imperative to innovate is\nunrelenting. Without the ability to\nexperiment in a more agile manner,\nthis company eventually would\nsuffer the fate described in The\nInnovator’s Dilemma: ever-higher\nprofits and margins year after year\nuntil the business suddenly\ncollapsed.\nWe often frame internal\ninnovation challenges by asking,\nHow can we protect the internal\nstartup from the parent organization?\nI would like to reframe and reverse\nthe question: How can we protect the\nparent organization from the startup?\nIn my experience, people defend\nthemselves when they feel\nthreatened, and no innovation can\nflourish if defensiveness is given free\nrein. In fact, this is why the common\nsuggestion to hide the innovation\nteam is misguided. There are\nexamples of one-time successes\nusing a secret skunkworks or off-site\ninnovation team, such as the building\nof the original IBM PC in Boca\nRaton, Florida, completely separate\nfrom mainline IBM. But these\nexamples should serve mostly as\ncautionary tales, because they have\nrarely led to sustainable innovation.2\nHiding from the parent organization\ncan have long-term negative\nconsequences.\nConsider it from the point of view\nof the managers who have the\ninnovation sprung on them. They are\nlikely to feel betrayed and more than\na little paranoid. After all, if\nsomething of this magnitude could\nbe hidden, what else is waiting in the\nshadows? Over time, this leads to\nmore politics as managers are\nincentivized to ferret out threats to\ntheir power, influence, and careers.\nThe fact that the innovation was a\nsuccess is no justification for this\ndishonest behavior. From the point\nof view of established managers, the\nmessage is clear: if you are not on\nthe inside, you are liable to be\nblindsided by this type of secret.\nIt is unfair to criticize these\nmanagers for their response; the\ncriticism should be aimed at senior\nexecutives who failed to design a\nsupportive system in which to\noperate and innovate. I believe this is\none reason why companies such as\nIBM lost their leadership position in\nthe new markets that they developed\nusing a black box such as the PC\nbusiness; they are unable to re-create\nand sustain the culture that led to the\ninnovation in the first place.\nCreating an Innovation Sandbox\nThe challenge here is to create a\nmechanism for empowering\ninnovation teams out in the open.\nThis is the path toward a sustainable\nculture of innovation over time as\ncompanies face repeated existential\nthreats. My suggested solution is to\ncreate a sandbox for innovation that\nwill contain the impact of the new\ninnovation but not constrain the\nmethods of the startup team. It works\nas follows:\n1. Any team can create a true\nsplit-test experiment that\naffects only the sandboxed\nparts of the product or service\n(for a multipart product) or\nonly certain customer\nsegments or territories (for a\nnew product). However:\n2. One team must see the whole\nexperiment through from end\nto end.\n3. No experiment can run longer\nthan a specified amount of\ntime (usually a few weeks for\nsimple feature experiments,\nlonger for more disruptive\ninnovations).\n4. No experiment can affect\nmore than a specified number\nof customers (usually\nexpressed as a percentage of\nthe company’s total\nmainstream customer base).\n5. Every experiment has to be\nevaluated on the basis of a\nsingle standard report of five\nto ten (no more) actionable\nmetrics.\n6. Every team that works inside\nthe sandbox and every\nproduct that is built must use\nthe same metrics to evaluate\nsuccess.\n7. Any team that creates an\nexperiment must monitor the\nmetrics and customer\nreactions (support calls,\nsocial media reaction, forum\nthreads, etc.) while the\nexperiment is in progress and\nabort it if something\ncatastrophic happens.\nAt the beginning, the sandbox has\nto be quite small. In the company\nabove, the sandbox initially\ncontained only the pricing page.\nDepending on the types of products\nthe company makes, the size of the\nsandbox can be defined in different\nways. For example, an online service\nmight restrict it to certain pages or\nuser flows. A retail operation might\nrestrict it to certain stores or\ngeographic areas. Companies trying\nto bring an entirely new product to\nmarket might build the restriction\naround customers in certain\nsegments.\nUnlike in a concept test or market\ntest, customers in the sandbox are\nconsidered real and the innovation\nteam is allowed to attempt to\nestablish a long-term relationship\nwith them. After all, they may be\nexperimenting with those early\nadopters for a long time before their\nlearning milestones are\naccomplished.\nWhenever possible, the innovation\nteam should be cross-functional and\nhave a clear team leader, like the\nT o y o t a shusa. It should be\nempowered to build, market, and\ndeploy products or features in the\nsandbox without prior approval. It\nshould be required to report on the\nsuccess or failure of those efforts by\nusing standard actionable metrics\nand innovation accounting.\nThis approach can work even for\nteams that have never before worked\ncross-functionally. The first few\nchanges, such as a price change, may\nnot require great engineering effort,\nbut they require coordination across\ndepartments: engineering, marketing,\ncustomer service. Teams that work\nthis way are more productive as long\nas productivity is measured by their\nability to create customer value and\nnot just stay busy.\nTrue experiments are easy to\nclassify as successes or failures\nbecause top-level metrics either\nmove or they don’t. Either way, the\nteam learns immediately whether its\nassumptions about how customers\nwill behave are correct. By using the\nsame metrics each time, the team\nbuilds literacy about those metrics\nacross the company. Because the\ninnovation team is reporting on its\nprogress by using the system of\ninnovation accounting described in\nPart Two, anyone who reads those\nreports is getting an implicit lesson\nin the power of actionable metrics.\nThis effect is extremely powerful.\nEven if someone wants to sabotage\nthe innovation team, he or she will\nhave to learn all about actionable\nmetrics and learning milestones to do\nit.\nThe sandbox also promotes rapid\niteration. When people have a\nchance to see a project through from\nend to end and the work is done in\nsmall batches and delivers a clear\nverdict quickly, they benefit from the\npower of feedback. Each time they\nfail to move the numbers, they have\na real opportunity to act on their\nfindings immediately. Thus, these\nteams tend to converge on optimal\nsolutions rapidly even if they start\nout with really bad ideas.\nAs we saw earlier, this is a\nmanifestation of the principle of\nsmall batches. Functional specialists,\nespecially those steeped in waterfall\nor stage-gate development, have\nbeen trained to work in extremely\nlarge batches. This causes even good\nideas to get bogged down by waste.\nBy making the batch size small, the\nsandbox method allows teams to\nmake cheap mistakes quickly and\nstart learning. As we’ll see below,\nthese small initial experiments can\ndemonstrate that a team has a viable\nnew business that can be integrated\nback into the parent company.\nHolding Internal Teams\nAccountable\nWe already discussed learning\nmilestones in detail in Chapter 7.\nWith an internal startup team, the\nsequence of accountability is the\nsame: build an ideal model of the\ndesired disruption that is based on\ncustomer archetypes, launch a\nminimum viable product to establish\na baseline, and then attempt to tune\nthe engine to get it closer to the\nideal.\nOperating in this framework,\ninternal teams essentially act as\nstartups. As they demonstrate\nsuccess, they need to become\nintegrated into the company’s overall\nportfolio of products and services.\nCULTIVATING THE\nMANAGEMENT PORTFOLIO\nThere are four major kinds of work\nthat companies must manage.3 As an\ninternal startup grows, the\nentrepreneurs who created the\noriginal concept must tackle the\nchallenge of scale. As new\nmainstream customers are acquired\nand new markets are conquered, the\nproduct becomes part of the public\nface of the company, with important\nimplications for PR, marketing,\nsales, and business development. In\nmost cases, the product will attract\ncompetitors: copycats, fast followers,\nand imitators of all stripes.\nOnce the market for the new\nproduct is well established,\nprocedures become more routine. To\ncombat the inevitable\ncommoditization of the product in its\nmarket, line extensions, incremental\nupgrades, and new forms of\nmarketing are essential. In this\nphase, operational excellence takes\non a greater role, as an important\nway to increase margins is to lower\ncosts. This may require a different\ntype of manager: one who excels in\noptimization, delegation, control, and\nexecution. Company stock prices\ndepend on this kind of predictable\ngrowth.\nThere is a fourth phase as well,\none dominated by operating costs\nand legacy products. This is the\ndomain of outsourcing, automation,\nand cost reduction. Nonetheless,\ninfrastructure is still mission-critical.\nFailure of facilities or important\ninfrastructure or the abandonment of\nloyal customers could derail the\nwhole company. However, unlike the\ngrowth and optimization phase,\ninvestments in this area will not help\nthe company achieve top-line\ngrowth. Managers of this kind of\norganization suffer the fate of\nbaseball umpires: criticized when\nsomething goes wrong,\nunappreciated when things are going\nwell.\nWe tend to speak of these four\nphases of businesses from the\nperspective of large companies, in\nwhich they may represent entire\ndivisions and hundreds or even\nthousands of people. That’s logical,\nas the evolution of the business in\nthese kinds of extreme cases is the\neasiest to observe. However, all\ncompanies engage in all four phases\nof work all the time. As soon as a\nproduct hits the marketplace, teams\nof people work hard to advance it to\nthe next phase. Every successful\nproduct or feature began life in\nresearch and development (R&D),\neventually became a part of the\ncompany’s strategy, was subject to\noptimization, and in time became old\nnews.\nThe problem for startups and large\ncompanies alike is that employees\noften follow the products they\ndevelop as they move from phase to\nphase. A common practice is for the\ninventor of a new product or feature\nto manage the subsequent resources,\nteam, or division that ultimately\ncommercializes it. As a result, strong\ncreative managers wind up getting\nstuck working on the growth and\noptimization of products rather than\ncreating new ones.\nThis tendency is one of the\nreasons established companies\nstruggle to find creative managers to\nfoster innovation in the first place.\nEvery new innovation competes for\nresources with established projects,\nand one of the scarcest resources is\ntalent.\nEntrepreneur Is a Job Title\nThe way out of this dilemma is to\nmanage the four kinds of work\ndifferently, allowing strong crossfunctional teams to develop around\neach area. When products move from\nphase to phase, they are handed off\nbetween teams. Employees can\nchoose to move with the product as\npart of the handoff or stay behind\nand begin work on something new.\nNeither choice is necessarily right or\nwrong; it depends on the\ntemperament and skills of the person\nin question.\nSome people are natural inventors\nwho prefer to work without the\npressure and expectations of the later\nbusiness phases. Others are\nambitious and see innovation as a\npath toward senior management. Still\nothers are particularly skilled at the\nmanagement of running an\nestablished business, outsourcing,\nand bolstering efficiencies and\nwringing out cost reductions. People\nshould be allowed to find the kinds\nof jobs that suit them best.\nIn fact, entrepreneurship should be\nconsidered a viable career path for\ninnovators inside large organizations.\nManagers who can lead teams by\nusing the Lean Startup methodology\nshould not have to leave the\ncompany to reap the rewards of their\nskills or have to pretend to fit into\nthe rigid hierarchies of established\nfunctional departments. Instead, they\nshould have a business card that says\nsimply “Entrepreneur” under the\nname. They should be held\naccountable via the system of\ninnovation accounting and promoted\nand rewarded accordingly.\nAfter an entrepreneur has\nincubated a product in the innovation\nsandbox, it has to be reintegrated\ninto the parent organization. A larger\nteam eventually will be needed to\ngrow it, commercialize it, and scale\nit. At first, this team will require the\ncontinued leadership of the\ninnovators who worked in the\nsandbox. In fact, this is a positive\npart of the process in that it gives the\ninnovators a chance to train new\nteam members in the new style of\nworking that they mastered in the\noriginal sandbox.\nIdeally, the sandbox will grow\nover time; that is, rather than move\nthe team out of the sandbox and into\nthe company’s standard routines,\nthere may be opportunities to enlarge\nthe scope of the sandbox. For\nexample, if only certain aspects of\nthe product were subject to\nexperimentation in the sandbox, new\nfeatures can be added. In the online\nservice described earlier, this could\nbe accomplished by starting with a\nsandbox that encompassed the\nproduct pricing page. When those\nexperiments succeeded, the company\ncould add the website’s home page\nto the sandbox. It subsequently might\nadd the search functionality or the\noverall web design. If only certain\ncustomers or certain numbers of\ncustomers were targeted initially, the\nproduct’s reach could be increased.\nWhen such changes are\ncontemplated, it’s important that\nsenior management consider whether\nthe teams working in the sandbox\ncan fend for themselves politically in\nthe parent organization. The sandbox\nwas designed to protect them and the\nparent organization, and any\nexpansion needs to take this into\naccount.\nWorking in the innovation\nsandbox is like developing startup\nmuscles. At first, the team will be\nable to take on only modest\nexperiments. The earliest\nexperiments may fail to produce\nmuch learning and may not lead to\nscalable success. Over time, those\nteams are almost guaranteed to\nimprove as long as they get the\nconstant feedback of small-batch\ndevelopment and actionable metrics\nand are held accountable to learning\nmilestones.\nOf course, any innovation system\neventually will become the victim of\nits own success. As the sandbox\nexpands and the company’s revenue\ngrows as a result of the sandbox’s\ninnovations, the cycle will have to\nbegin again. The former innovators\nwill become guardians of the status\nquo. When the product makes up the\nwhole sandbox, it inevitably will\nbecome encumbered with the\nadditional rules and controls needed\nfor mission-critical operation. New\ninnovation teams will need a new\nsandbox within which to play.\nBecoming the Status Quo\nThis last transition is especially hard\nfor innovators to accept: their\ntransformation from radical outsiders\nto the embodiment of the status quo.\nI have found it disturbing in my\ncareer. As you can guess from the\ntechniques I advocate as part of the\nLean Startup, I have always been a\nbit of a troublemaker at the\ncompanies at which I have worked,\npushing for rapid iteration, datadriven decision making, and early\ncustomer involvement. When these\nideas were not part of the dominant\nculture, it was simple (if frustrating)\nto be an advocate. All I had to do\nwas push as hard as humanly\npossible for my ideas. Since the\ndominant culture found them\nheretical, they would compromise\nwith me a “reasonable” amount.\nThanks to the psychological\nphenomenon of anchoring, this led to\na perverse incentive: the more\nradical my suggestion was, the more\nlikely it was that the reasonable\ncompromise would be closer to my\ntrue goal.\nFast-forward several years to\nwhen I was running product\ndevelopment. When we’d hire new\npeople, they had to be indoctrinated\ninto the Lean Startup culture. Split\ntesting, continuous deployment, and\ncustomer testing were all standard\npractice. I needed to continue to be a\nstrong advocate for my ideas,\nmaking sure each new employee was\nready to give them a try. But for the\npeople who had been working there\nawhile, those ideas had become part\nof the status quo.\nLike many entrepreneurs, I was\ncaught between constant\nevangelizing for my ideas and\nconstantly entertaining suggestions\nfor ways they could be improved.\nMy employees faced the same\nincentive I had exploited years\nbefore: the more radical the\nsuggestion is, the more likely it is\nthat the compromise will move in the\ndirection they desire. I heard it all:\nsuggestions that we go back to\nwaterfall development, use more\nquality assurance (QA), use less QA,\nhave more or less customer\ninvolvement, use more vision and\nless data, or interpret data in a more\nstatistically rigorous way.\nIt took a constant effort to\nconsider these suggestions seriously.\nHowever, responding dogmatically is\nunhelpful. Compromising by\nautomatically splitting the difference\ndoesn’t work either.\nI’ve found that every suggestion\nshould be subjected to the same\nrigorous scientific inquiry that led to\nthe creation of the Lean Startup in\nthe first place. Can we use the theory\nto predict the results of the proposed\nchange? Can we incubate the change\nin a small team and see what\nhappens? Can we measure its\nimpact? Whenever they could be\nimplemented, these approaches have\nallowed me to increase my own\nlearning and, more important, the\nproductivity of the companies I have\nworked with. Many of the Lean\nStartup techniques that we pioneered\nat IMVU are not my original\ncontributions. Rather, they were\nconceived, incubated, and executed\nby employees who brought their own\ncreativity and talent to the task.\nAbove all, I faced this common\nquestion: How do we know that\n“your way” of building a company\nwill work? What other companies\nare using it? Who has become rich\nand famous as a result? These\nquestions are sensible. The titans of\nour industry are all working in a\nslower, more linear way. Why are we\ndoing something different?\nIt is these questions that require\nthe use of theory to answer. Those\nwho look to adopt the Lean Startup\nas a defined set of steps or tactics\nwill not succeed. I had to learn this\nthe hard way. In a startup situation,\nthings constantly go wrong. When\nthat happens, we face the age-old\ndilemma summarized by Deming:\nHow do we know that the problem is\ndue to a special cause versus a\nsystemic cause? If we’re in the\nmiddle of adopting a new way of\nworking, the temptation will always\nbe to blame the new system for the\nproblems that arise. Sometimes that\ntendency is correct, sometimes not.\nLearning to tell the difference\nrequires theory. You have to be able\nto predict the outcome of the changes\nyou make to tell if the problems that\nresult are really problems.\nFor example, changing the\ndefinition of productivity for a team\nfrom functional excellence—\nexcellence in marketing, sales, or\nproduct development—to validated\nlearning will cause problems. As was\nindicated earlier, functional\nspecialists are accustomed to\nmeasuring their efficiency by\nlooking at the proportion of time they\nare busy doing their work. A\nprogrammer expects to be coding all\nday long, for example. That is why\nmany traditional work environments\nfrustrate these experts: the constant\ninterruption of meetings, crossfunctional handoffs, and\nexplanations for endless numbers of\nbosses all act as a drag on efficiency.\nHowever, the individual efficiency of\nthese specialists is not the goal in a\nLean Startup. Instead, we want to\nforce teams to work crossfunctionally to achieve validated\nlearning. Many of the techniques for\ndoing this—actionable metrics,\ncontinuous deployment, and the\noverall Build-Measure-Learn\nfeedback loop—necessarily cause\nteams to suboptimize for their\nindividual functions. It does not\nmatter how fast we can build. It does\nnot matter how fast we can measure.\nWhat matters is how fast we can get\nthrough the entire loop.\nIn my years teaching this system, I\nhave noticed this pattern every time:\nswitching to validated learning feels\nworse before it feels better. That’s\nthe case because the problems\ncaused by the old system tend to be\nintangible, whereas the problems of\nthe new system are all too tangible.\nHaving the benefit of theory is the\nantidote to these challenges. If it is\nknown that this loss of productivity\nis an inevitable part of the transition,\nit can be managed actively.\nExpectations can be set up front. In\nmy consulting practice, for example,\nI have learned to raise these issues\nfrom day one; otherwise, they are\nliable to derail the whole effort once\nit is under way. As the change\nprogresses, we can use the root cause\nanalysis and fast response techniques\nto figure out which problems need\nprevention. Ultimately, the Lean\nStartup is a framework, not a\nblueprint of steps to follow. It is\ndesigned to be adapted to the\nconditions of each specific company.\nRather than copy what others have\ndone, techniques such as the Five\nWhys allow you to build something\nthat is perfectly suited to your\ncompany.\nThe best way to achieve mastery\nof and explore these ideas is to\nembed oneself in a community of\npractice. There is a thriving\ncommunity of Lean Startup meetups\naround the world as well as online,\nand suggestions for how you can\ntake advantage of these resources\nlisted in the last chapter of this book,\n“Join the Movement.”\n13\nEPILOGUE: WASTE NOT\nThis year marks the one hundredth\nanniversary of Frederick Winslow\nTaylor’s The Principles of Scientific\nManagement, first published in 1911.\nThe movement for scientific\nmanagement changed the course of\nthe twentieth century by making\npossible the tremendous prosperity\nthat we take for granted today.\nTaylor effectively invented what we\nnow consider simply management:\nimproving the efficiency of\nindividual workers, management by\nexception (focusing only on\nunexpectedly good or bad results),\nstandardizing work into tasks, the\ntask-plus-bonus system of\ncompensation, and—above all—the\nidea that work can be studied and\nimproved through conscious effort.\nTaylor invented modern white-collar\nwork that sees companies as systems\nthat must be managed at more than\nthe level of the individual. There is a\nreason all past management\nrevolutions have been led by\nengineers: management is human\nsystems engineering.\nIn 1911 Taylor wrote: “In the past,\nthe man has been first; in the future,\nthe system must be first.” Taylor’s\nprediction has come to pass. We are\nliving in the world he imagined. And\nyet, the revolution that he unleashed\nhas been—in many ways—too\nsuccessful. Whereas Taylor preached\nscience as a way of thinking, many\npeople confused his message with\nthe rigid techniques he advocated:\ntime and motion studies, the\ndifferential piece-rate system, and—\nmost galling of all—the idea that\nworkers should be treated as little\nmore than automatons. Many of\nthese ideas proved extremely\nharmful and required the efforts of\nlater theorists and managers to undo.\nCritically, lean manufacturing\nrediscovered the wisdom and\ninitiative hidden in every factory\nworker and redirected Taylor’s\nnotion of efficiency away from the\nindividual task and toward the\ncorporate organism as a whole. But\neach of these subsequent revolutions\nhas embraced Taylor’s core idea that\nwork can be studied scientifically\nand can be improved through a\nrigorous experimental approach.\nIn the twenty-first century, we\nface a new set of problems that\nTaylor could not have imagined. Our\nproductive capacity greatly exceeds\nour ability to know what to build.\nAlthough there was a tremendous\namount of invention and innovation\nin the early twentieth century, most\nof it was devoted to increasing the\nproductivity of workers and\nmachines in order to feed, clothe,\nand house the world’s population.\nAlthough that project is still\nincomplete, as the millions who live\nin poverty can attest, the solution to\nthat problem is now strictly a\npolitical one. We have the capacity\nto build almost anything we can\nimagine. The big question of our\ntime is not Can it be built? but\nShould it be built? This places us in\nan unusual historical moment: our\nfuture prosperity depends on the\nquality of our collective\nimaginations.\nIn 1911, Taylor wrote:\nWe can see our forests\nvanishing, our water-powers\ngoing to waste, our soil being\ncarried by floods into the sea;\nand the end of our coal and our\niron is in sight. But our larger\nwastes of human effort, which\ngo on every day through such of\nour acts as are blundering, illdirected, or inefficient … are\nless visible, less tangible, and\nare but vaguely appreciated.\nWe can see and feel the\nwaste of material things.\nAwkward, inefficient, or illdirected movements of men,\nhowever, leave nothing visible\nor tangible behind them. Their\nappreciation calls for an act of\nmemory, an effort of the\nimagination. And for this\nreason, even though our daily\nloss from this source is greater\nthan from our waste of material\nthings, the one has stirred us\ndeeply, while the other has\nmoved us but little.1\nA century on, what can we say\nabout those words? On the one hand,\nthey feel archaic. We of the twentyfirst century are hyperaware of the\nimportance of efficiency and the\neconomic value of productivity\ngains. Our workplaces are—at least\nwhen it comes to the building of\nmaterial objects—incredibly well\norganized compared with those of\nTaylor’s day.\nOn the other hand, Taylor’s words\nstrike me as completely\ncontemporary. For all of our vaunted\nefficiency in the making of things,\nour economy is still incredibly\nwasteful. This waste comes not from\nthe inefficient organization of work\nbut rather from working on the\nwrong things—and on an industrial\nscale. As Peter Drucker said, “There\nis surely nothing quite so useless as\ndoing with great efficiency what\nshould not be done at all.”2\nAnd yet we are doing the wrong\nthings efficiently all the time. It is\nhard to come by a solid estimate of\njust how wasteful modern work is,\nbut there is no shortage of anecdotes.\nIn my consulting and travels talking\nabout the Lean Startup, I hear the\nsame message consistently from\nemployees of companies big and\nsmall. In every industry we see\nendless stories of failed launches, illconceived projects, and large-batch\ndeath spirals. I consider this misuse\nof people’s time a criminally\nnegligent waste of human creativity\nand potential.\nWhat percentage of all this waste\nis preventable? I think a much larger\nproportion than we currently realize.\nMost people I meet believe that in\ntheir industry at least, projects fail\nfor good reasons: projects are\ninherently risky, market conditions\nare unpredictable, “big company\npeople” are intrinsically uncreative.\nSome believe that if we just slowed\neverything down and used a more\ncareful process, we could reduce the\nfailure rate by doing fewer projects\nof higher quality. Others believe that\ncertain people have an innate gift of\nknowing the right thing to build. If\nwe can find enough of these\nvisionaries and virtuosos, our\nproblems will be solved. These\n“solutions” were once considered\nstate of the art in the nineteenth\ncentury, too, before people knew\nabout modern management.\nThe requirements of an ever-faster\nworld make these antique\napproaches unworkable, and so the\nblame for failed projects and\nbusinesses often is heaped on senior\nmanagement, which is asked to do\nthe impossible. Alternatively, the\nfinger of blame is pointed at\nfinancial investors or the public\nmarkets for overemphasizing quick\nfixes and short-term results. We have\nplenty of blame to go around, but far\ntoo little theory to guide the actions\nof leaders and investors alike.\nThe Lean Startup movement\nstands in contrast to this handwringing. We believe that most\nforms of waste in innovation are\npreventable once their causes are\nunderstood. All that is required is\nthat we change our collective mindset concerning how this work is to be\ndone.\nIt is insufficient to exhort workers\nto try harder. Our current problems\nare caused by trying too hard—at the\nwrong things. By focusing on\nfunctional efficiency, we lose sight\nof the real goal of innovation: to\nlearn that which is currently\nunknown. As Deming taught, what\nmatters is not setting quantitative\ngoals but fixing the method by which\nthose goals are attained. The Lean\nStartup movement stands for the\nprinciple that the scientific method\ncan be brought to bear to answer the\nmost pressing innovation question:\nHow can we build a sustainable\norganization around a new set of\nproducts or services?\nORGANIZATIONAL\nSUPERPOWERS\nA participant at one of my\nworkshops came up to me a few\nmonths afterward to relate the\nfollowing story, which I am\nparaphrasing: “Knowing Lean\nStartup principles makes me feel like\nI have superpowers. Even though\nI’m just a junior employee, when I\nmeet with corporate VPs and GMs in\nmy large company, I ask them\nsimple questions and very quickly\nhelp them see how their projects are\nbased on fundamental hypotheses\nthat are testable. In minutes, I can lay\nout a plan they could follow to\nscientifically validate their plans\nbefore it’s too late. They consistently\nrespond with ‘Wow, you are\nbrilliant. We’ve never thought to\napply that level of rigor to our\nthinking about new products\nbefore.’ ”\nAs a result of these interactions,\nhe has developed a reputation within\nhis large company as a brilliant\nemployee. This has been good for his\ncareer but very frustrating for him\npersonally. Why? Because although\nhe is quite brilliant, his insights into\nflawed product plans are due not to\nhis special intelligence but to having\na theory that allows him to predict\nwhat will happen and propose\nalternatives. He is frustrated because\nthe managers he is pitching his ideas\nto do not see the system. They\nwrongly conclude that the key to\nsuccess is finding brilliant people\nlike him to put on their teams. They\nare failing to see the opportunity he\nis really presenting them: to achieve\nbetter results systematically by\nchanging their beliefs about how\ninnovation happens.\nPutting the System First: Some\nDangers\nLike Taylor before us, our challenge\nis to persuade the managers of\nmodern corporations to put the\nsystem first. However, Taylorism\nshould act as a cautionary tale, and it\nis important to learn the lessons of\nhistory as we bring these new ideas\nto a more mainstream audience.\nTaylor is remembered for his\nfocus on systematic practice rather\nthan individual brilliance. Here is the\nfull quote from The Principles of\nScientific Management that includes\nthe famous line about putting the\nsystem first:\nIn the future it will be\nappreciated that our leaders\nmust be trained right as well as\nborn right, and that no great\nman can (with the old system of\npersonal management) hope to\ncompete with a number of\nordinary men who have been\nproperly organized so as\nefficiently to cooperate.\nIn the past the man has been\nfirst; in the future the system\nmust be first. This in no sense,\nhowever, implies that great men\nare not needed. On the contrary,\nthe first object of any good\nsystem must be that of\ndeveloping first-class men; and\nunder systematic management\nthe best man rises to the top\nmore certainly and more rapidly\nthan ever before.3\nUnfortunately, Taylor’s insistence\nthat scientific management does not\nstand in opposition to finding and\npromoting the best individuals was\nquickly forgotten. In fact, the\nproductivity gains to be had through\nthe early scientific management\ntactics, such as time and motion\nstudy, task-plus-bonus, and\nespecially functional foremanship\n(the forerunner of today’s functional\ndepartments), were so significant\nthat subsequent generations of\nmanagers lost sight of the\nimportance of the people who were\nimplementing them.\nThis has led to two problems: (1)\nbusiness systems became overly\nrigid and thereby failed to take\nadvantage of the adaptability,\ncreativity, and wisdom of individual\nworkers, and (2) there has been an\noveremphasis on planning,\nprevention, and procedure, which\nenable organizations to achieve\nconsistent results in a mostly static\nworld. On the factory floor, these\nproblems have been tackled head on\nby the lean manufacturing\nmovement, and those lessons have\nspread throughout many modern\ncorporations. And yet in new product\ndevelopment, entrepreneurship, and\ninnovation work in general we are\nstill using an outdated framework.\nMy hope is that the Lean Startup\nmovement will not fall into the same\nreductionist trap. We are just\nbeginning to uncover the rules that\ngovern entrepreneurship, a method\nthat can improve the odds of startup\nsuccess, and a systematic approach\nto building new and innovative\nproducts. This in no way diminishes\nthe traditional entrepreneurial\nvirtues: the primacy of vision, the\nwillingness to take bold risks, and\nthe courage required in the face of\noverwhelming odds. Our society\nneeds the creativity and vision of\nentrepreneurs more than ever. In fact,\nit is precisely because these are such\nprecious resources that we cannot\nafford to waste them.\nProduct Development\nPseudoscience\nI believe that if Taylor were alive\ntoday, he would chuckle at what\nconstitutes the management of\nentrepreneurs and innovators.\nAlthough we harness the labor of\nscientists and engineers who would\nhave dazzled any early-twentiethcentury person with their feats of\ntechnical wizardry, the management\npractices we use to organize them\nare generally devoid of scientific\nrigor. In fact, I would go so far as to\ncall them pseudoscience.\nWe routinely green-light new\nprojects more on the basis of\nintuition than facts. As we’ve seen\nthroughout this book, that is not the\nroot cause of the problem. All\ninnovation begins with vision. It’s\nwhat happens next that is critical. As\nwe’ve seen, too many innovation\nteams engage in success theater,\nselectively finding data that support\ntheir vision rather than exposing the\nelements of the vision to true\nexperiments, or, even worse, staying\nin stealth mode to create a data-free\nzone for unlimited “experimentation”\nthat is devoid of customer feedback\nor external accountability of any\nkind. Anytime a team attempts to\ndemonstrate cause and effect by\nplacing highlights on a graph of\ngross metrics, it is engaging in\npseudoscience. How do we know\nthat the proposed cause and effect is\ntrue? Anytime a team attempts to\njustify its failures by resorting to\nlearning as an excuse, it is engaged\nin pseudoscience as well.\nIf learning has taken place in one\niteration cycle, let us demonstrate it\nby turning it into validated learning\nin the next cycle. Only by building a\nmodel of customer behavior and then\nshowing our ability to use our\nproduct or service to change it over\ntime can we establish real facts about\nthe validity of our vision.\nThroughout our celebration of the\nsuccess of the Lean Startup\nmovement, a note of caution is\nessential. We cannot afford to have\nour success breed a new\npseudoscience around pivots, MVPs,\nand the like. This was the fate of\nscientific management, and in the\nend, I believe, that set back its cause\nby decades. Science came to stand\nfor the victory of routine work over\ncreative work, mechanization over\nhumanity, and plans over agility.\nLater movements had to be spawned\nto correct those deficiencies.\nTaylor believed in many things\nthat he dubbed scientific but that our\nmodern eyes perceive as mere\nprejudice. He believed in the\ninherent superiority in both\nintelligence and character of\naristocratic men over the working\nclasses and the superiority of men\nover women; he also thought that\nlower-status people should be\nsupervised strictly by their betters.\nThese beliefs are part and parcel of\nTaylor’s time, and it is tempting to\nforgive him for having been blind to\nthem.\nYet when our time is viewed\nthrough the lens of future practice,\nwhat prejudices will be revealed? In\nwhat forces do we place undue faith?\nWhat might we risk losing sight of\nwith this initial success of our\nmovement?\nIt is with these questions that I\nwish to close. As gratifying as it is\nfor me to see the Lean Startup\nmovement gain fame and\nrecognition, it is far more important\nthat we be right in our prescriptions.\nWhat is known so far is just the tip\nof the iceberg. What is needed is a\nmassive project to discover how to\nunlock the vast stores of potential\nthat are hidden in plain sight in our\nmodern workforce. If we stopped\nwasting people’s time, what would\nthey do with it? We have no real\nconcept of what is possible.\nStarting in the late 1880s, Taylor\nbegan a program of experimentation\nto discover the optimal way to cut\nsteel. In the course of that research,\nwhich lasted more than twenty-five\nyears, he and his colleagues\nperformed more than twenty\nthousand individual experiments.\nWhat is remarkable about this\nproject is that it had no academic\nbacking, no government R&D\nbudget. Its entire cost was paid by\nindustry out of the immediate profits\ngenerated from the higher\nproductivity the experiments\nenabled. This was only one\nexperimental program to uncover the\nhidden productivity in just one kind\nof work. Other scientific\nmanagement disciples spent years\ninvestigating bricklaying, farming,\nand even shoveling. They were\nobsessed with learning the truth and\nwere not satisfied with the folk\nwisdom of craftspersons or the\nparables of experts.\nCan any of us imagine a modern\nknowledge-work manager with the\nsame level of interest in the methods\nhis or her employees use? How\nmuch of our current innovation work\nis guided by catchphrases that lack a\nscientific foundation?\nA New Research Program\nWhat comparable research programs\ncould we be engaged in to discover\nhow to work more effectively?\nFor one thing, we have very little\nunderstanding of what stimulates\nproductivity under conditions of\nextreme uncertainty. Luckily, with\ncycle times falling everywhere, we\nhave many opportunities to test new\napproaches. Thus, I propose that we\ncreate startup testing labs that could\nput all manner of product\ndevelopment methodologies to the\ntest.\nHow might those tests be\nconducted? We could bring in small\ncross-functional teams, perhaps\nbeginning with product and\nengineering, and have them work to\nsolve problems by using different\ndevelopment methodologies. We\ncould begin with problems with clear\nright answers, perhaps drawn from\nthe many international programming\ncompetitions that have developed\ndatabases of well-defined problems\nwith clear solutions. These\ncompetitions also provide a clear\nbaseline of how long it should take\nfor various problems to be solved so\nthat we could establish clearly the\nindividual problem-solving prowess\nof the experimental subjects.\nUsing this kind of setup for\ncalibration, we could begin to vary\nthe conditions of the experiments.\nThe challenge will be to increase the\nlevel of uncertainty about what the\nright answer is while still being able\nto measure the quality of the\noutcome objectively. Perhaps we\ncould use real-world customer\nproblems and then have real\nconsumers test the output of the\nteams’ work. Or perhaps we could\ngo so far as to build minimum viable\nproducts for solving the same set of\nproblems over and over again to\nquantify which produces the best\ncustomer conversion rates.\nWe also could vary the allimportant cycle time by choosing\nmore or less complex development\nplatforms and distribution channels\nto test the impact of those factors on\nthe true productivity of the teams.\nMost of all, we need to develop\nclear methods for holding teams\naccountable for validated learning. I\nhave proposed one method in this\nbook: innovation accounting using a\nwell-defined financial model and\nengine of growth. However, it is\nnaive to assume that this is the best\npossible method. As it is adopted in\nmore and more companies,\nundoubtedly new techniques will be\nsuggested, and we need to be able to\nevaluate the new ideas as rigorously\nas possible.\nAll these questions raise the\npossibilities of public-private\npartnerships between research\nuniversities and the entrepreneurial\ncommunities they seek to foster. It\nalso suggests that universities may\nbe able to add value in more ways\nthan by being simply financial\ninvestors or creators of startup\nincubators, as is the current trend.\nMy prediction is that wherever this\nresearch is conducted will become an\nepicenter of new entrepreneurial\npractice, and universities conducting\nthis research therefore may be able to\nachieve a much higher level of\ncommercialization of their basic\nresearch activities.4\nTHE LONG-TERM STOCK\nEXCHANGE\nBeyond simple research, I believe\nour goal should be to change the\nentire ecosystem of entrepreneurship.\nToo much of our startup industry has\ndevolved into a feeder system for\ngiant media companies and\ninvestment banks. Part of the reason\nestablished companies struggle to\ninvest consistently in innovation is\nintense pressure from public markets\nto hit short-term profitability and\ngrowth targets. Mostly, this is a\nconsequence of the accounting\nmethods we have developed for\nevaluating managers, which focus on\nthe kinds of gross “vanity” metrics\ndiscussed in Chapter 7. What is\nneeded is a new kind of stock\nexchange, designed to trade in the\nstocks of companies that are\norganized to sustain long-term\nthinking. I propose that we create a\nLong-Term Stock Exchange (LTSE).\nIn addition to quarterly reports on\nprofits and margins, companies on\nthe LTSE would report using\ninnovation accounting on their\ninternal entrepreneurship efforts.\nLike Intuit, they would report on the\nrevenue they were generating from\nproducts that did not exist a few\nyears earlier. Executive\ncompensation in LTSE companies\nwould be tied to the company’s longterm performance. Trading on the\nLTSE would have much higher\ntransaction costs and fees to\nminimize day trading and massive\nprice swings. In exchange, LTSE\ncompanies would be allowed to\nstructure their corporate governance\nto facilitate greater freedom for\nmanagement to pursue long-term\ninvestments. In addition to support\nfor long-term thinking, the\ntransparency of the LTSE will\nprovide valuable data about how to\nnurture innovation in the real world.\nSomething like the LTSE would\naccelerate the creation of the next\ngeneration of great companies, built\nfrom the ground up for continuous\ninnovation.\nIN CONCLUSION\nAs a movement, the Lean Startup\nmust avoid doctrines and rigid\nideology. We must avoid the\ncaricature that science means\nformula or a lack of humanity in\nwork. In fact, science is one of\nhumanity’s most creative pursuits. I\nbelieve that applying it to\nentrepreneurship will unlock a vast\nstorehouse of human potential.\nWhat would an organization look\nlike if all of its employees were\narmed with Lean Startup\norganizational superpowers?\nFor one thing, everyone would\ninsist that assumptions be stated\nexplicitly and tested rigorously not\nas a stalling tactic or a form of makework but out of a genuine desire to\ndiscover the truth that underlies\nevery project’s vision.\nWe would not waste time on\nendless arguments between the\ndefenders of quality and the cowboys\nof reckless advance; instead, we\nwould recognize that speed and\nquality are allies in the pursuit of the\ncustomer’s long-term benefit. We\nwould race to test our vision but not\nto abandon it. We would look to\neliminate waste not to build quality\ncastles in the sky but in the service\nof agility and breakthrough business\nresults.\nWe would respond to failures and\nsetbacks with honesty and learning,\nnot with recriminations and blame.\nMore than that, we would shun the\nimpulse to slow down, increase\nbatch size, and indulge in the curse\nof prevention. Instead, we would\nachieve speed by bypassing the\nexcess work that does not lead to\nlearning. We would dedicate\nourselves to the creation of new\ninstitutions with a long-term mission\nto build sustainable value and change\nthe world for the better.\nMost of all, we would stop\nwasting people’s time.\n14\nJOIN THE MOVEMENT\nIn the past few years, the Lean\nStartup movement has gone global.\nThe number of resources available\nfor aspiring entrepreneurs is\nincredible.

Many\ndedicated public servants\nare currently working hard\nto incorporate this\nexperimental approach in\nthe public sector under the\nleadership of President\nObama. I would like to\nthank Aneesh Chopra,\nChris Vein, Todd Park, and\nDavid Forrest for\nintroducing me to these\ngroundbreaking efforts.\nChapter 5. Leap\n1. For example, CU\nCommunity, which began\nat Columbia University,\nhad an early head start. See\nhttp://www.slate.com/id/\n2269131/.

Actual engagement numbers\nfrom 2004 are hard to find,\nbut this pattern has been\nconsistent throughout\nFacebook’s public\nstatements. For example,\nChris Hughes reported in\n2005 that “60% log in\ndaily. About 85% log in at\nleast once a week, and\n93% log in at least once a\nmonth.” http://techcrunch.\ncom/2005/09/07/85-ofcollege-students-use-\nfacebook/\n3. I first heard the term leap of\nfaith applied to startup\nassumptions by Randy\nKomisar, a former\ncolleague and current\npartner at the venture firm\nKleiner Perkins Caufield &\nByers. He expands on the\nconcept in his book\nGetting to Plan B,\ncoauthored with John\nMullins.\n4. http://www.forbes.com/2009/\n09/17/venture-capital-ipodintelligent-technology-\nkomisar.html\n5. “A carefully researched table\ncompiled for Motor\nmagazine by Charles E.\nDuryea, himself a pioneer\ncarmaker, revealed that\nfrom 1900 to 1908, 501\ncompanies were formed in\nthe United States for the\npurpose of manufacturing\nautomobiles. Sixty percent\nof them folded outright\nwithin a couple of years;\nanother 6 percent moved\ninto other areas of\nproduction.” This quote is\nfrom the Ford biography\nThe People’s Tycoon:\nHenry Ford and the\nAmerican Century by\nSteven Watts (New York:\nVintage, 2006).\n6.

The term minimum viable\nproduct has been in use\nsince at least 2000 as part\nof various approaches to\nproduct development. For\nan academic example, see\nhttp://www2.cs.uidaho.\nedu/~billjunk/Publications/\nDynamicBalance.pdf\nSee also Frank Robinson of\nPMDI, who refers to a version\nof the product that is the\nsmallest needed to sell to\npotential customers (http://\nproductdevelopment.com/\nhowitworks/mvp.html). This is\nsimilar to Steve Blank’s concept\nof the “minimum feature set” in\ncustomer development (http://\nsteveblank.com/2010/03/04/\nperfection-by-subtraction-theminimum-feature-set/). My use\nof the term here has been\ngeneralized to any version of a\nproduct that can begin the\nprocess of learning, using the\nBuild-Measure-Learn feedback\nloop. For more, see http://www.\nstartuplessonslearned.com/\n2009/08/minimum-viableproduct-guide.html\n4. Many people have written\nabout this phenomenon,\nusing varying terminology.\nProbably the most widely\nread is Geoffrey Moore’s\nCrossing the Chasm. For\nmore, see Eric Von\nHippel’s research into\nwhat he termed “lead\nusers”; his book The\nSources of Innovation is a\ngreat place to start. Steve\nBlank uses the term\nearlyvangelist to\nemphasize the evangelical\npowers of these early\ncustomers.\n5. “To the casual observer, the\nDropbox demo video\nlooked like a normal\nproduct demonstration,”\nDrew says, “but we put in\nabout a dozen Easter eggs\nthat were tailored for the\nDigg audience.

One extremely\ndetail-oriented blogger\ntook one video and broke it\ndown, second-by-second,\nto see where the time went:\n“You lose between 2 and 5\nseconds every time you\nmove the pile around\nbetween steps. Also, you\nhave to manage the pile\nseveral times during a task,\nsomething you don’t have\nto do nearly as much with\n[single-piece flow].

Without their\nrelentless—and mostly unheralded—\nwork every day, none of this would\nbe possible. Thank you.\nReal startups involve failure,\nembarrassing mistakes, and constant\nchaos. In my research for this book, I\ndiscovered that most entrepreneurs\nand managers would prefer not to\nhave the real story of their daily\nwork told in public. Therefore, I am\nindebted to the courageous\nentrepreneurs who consented to have\ntheir stories told, many of whom\nspent hours in tedious interviews and\nfact-checking conversations. Thank\nyou.\nI have been grateful throughout\nmy career to have mentors and\ncollaborators who have pushed me to\naccomplish more than I could have\non my own. Will Harvey is\nresponsible for both recruiting me to\nSilicon Valley in the first place and\nfor trusting me with the opportunity\nto try out many of these ideas for the\nfirst time at IMVU. I am grateful to\nmy other IMVU cofounders Marcus\nGosling, Matt Danzig, and Mel\nGuymon as well as the many IMVU\nemployees who did so much of the\nwork I discussed. Of course, none of\nthat would have been possible\nwithout the support of millions of\nIMVU customers over the years. I’d\nalso like to thank David Millstone,\nKen Duda, Fernando Paiz, Steve\nWeinstein, Owen Mahoney, Ray\nOcampo, and Jason Altieri for their\nhelp along the way.\nWe all owe Steve Blank a debt for\nthe work he did developing the\ntheory of customer development at a\ntime when it was considered\nheretical in startup and VC circles.\nAs I mentioned in the Introduction,\nSteve was an early investor in and\nadviser to IMVU. For the past seven\nyears, he has been an adviser,\nmentor, and collaborator to me\npersonally. I want to thank him for\nhis encouragement, support, and\nfriendship.\nThe Lean Startup movement is\nmade up of many more thinkers,\npractitioners, and writers than just\nme. I want to thank Dave McClure,\nAsh Maurya, Brant Cooper, Patrick\nVlaskovits, Sean Ellis, Andrew\nChen, Sean Murphy, Trevor Owens,\nHiten Shah, and Kent Beck for their\nideas, support, and evangelism.\nSeveral investors and venture\ncapitalists were early supporters and\nadopters. I would like to thank Mike\nMaples and Ann Miura-Ko\n(Floodgate), Steve Anderson\n(Baseline), Josh Kopelman (First\nRound Capital), Ron Conway (SV\nAngel), and Jeff Clavier (SoftTech\nVC).\nAs you can imagine, this book\ninvolved a tremendous amount of\nfeedback, iteration, and testing. I\nreceived invaluable, in-depth early\nfeedback from Laura Crescimano,\nLee Hoffman, Professor Tom\nEisenmann, and Sacha Judd. Thanks\nalso to Mitch Kapor, Scott Cook,\nShawn Fanning, Mark Graban,\nJennifer Carolan, Manuel Rosso,\nTim O’Reilly, and Reid Hoffman for\ntheir suggestions, feedback, and\nsupport. I owe a special note of\nthanks to Ruth Kaplan and Ira Fay\nfor their wisdom and friendship.\nThroughout the process of writing\nthe book, I had the benefit of a\ncustom-built testing platform to run\nsplit-test experiments on everything\nfrom cover design to subtitles to\nactual bits of the book (you can see\nthe results of these experiments at\nhttp://lean.st). Pivotal Labs built this\nsoftware for me; they are the premier\npractitioners of agile development.\nSpecial thanks to Rob Mee, Ian\nMcFarland, and—most important—\nParker Thompson, who worked\ntirelessly to build, experiment, and\nlearn with me.\nThanks also to IMVU cofounder\nMarcus Gosling, one of the most\ntalented designers I know, who\ndesigned this book’s cover, after\ncountless iterations.\nOne of the premier web and user\nexperience design firms, Digital\nTelepathy, designed and built the\nwebsite for http://theleanstartup.com,\nusing their unique Iterative\nPerformance Design process.

Much of the research that\nwent into this book was generously\nunderwritten by the Kauffman\nFoundation. At Kauffman, I want to\nespecially thank Bo Fishback and\nNick Seguin for their support. I spent\nthe past year as an entrepreneur-inresidence at Harvard Business\nSchool, where I enjoyed the\nopportunity to test my ideas against\nsome of the brightest minds in\nbusiness. I am especially grateful to\nProfessors Tom Eisenmann and\nMike Roberts for their sponsorship\nand support, as well as to the\nstudents of the HBS Startup Tribe. I\nalso had the opportunity to spend a\nbrief time with an office at the\npremier venture capital firm in\nSilicon Valley, Kleiner Perkins\nCaufield & Byers, where I received\nan in-depth education into how\nentrepreneurship is nurtured at the\nhighest levels. Thanks to Chi-Hua\nChien, Randy Komisar, Matt\nMurphy, Bing Gordon, Aileen Lee,\nand Ellen Pao, and to my officemate\nand EIR, Cyriac Roeding.\nMy research team helped me\ndocument case studies, interview\nhundreds of startups, and filter\nthousands of stories.

My editor, Roger Scholl, saw\nthe vision of this book from the very\nbeginning and shepherded it through\nthe entire process. I want to also\nthank Tina Constable, Tara Gilbride,\nand Meredith McGinnis and\neveryone else who worked on\nmaking this book a reality.\nThose who had the misfortune of\nreading an early draft know just how\nmuch gratitude I owe to Laureen\nRowland, who provided essential\neditorial help on an unbelievably\ntight schedule. If you enjoyed any\npart of this book, she deserves your\nthanks.\nMy adviser, partner, and\nconsigliere throughout the\npublishing process has been my\nphenomenal agent, Christy Fletcher.\nShe has the uncanny ability to\npredict the future, make things\nhappen, and keep every stakeholder\nhappy—all at the same time. She\ntruly understands the modern media\nlandscape and has helped me\nnavigate its crazy waters at every\nturn. At Fletcher and Company, I\nalso want to thank Alyssa Wolff,\nwho has been a tireless advocate and\ngatekeeper, and Melissa Chinchillo,\nwho is working to bring this book to\nnew regions and languages.\nI know it is a cliché to say, “None\nof this would have been possible\nwithout the constant support of my\nloving family.” But in this case, it is\nsimply the truth. My parents, Vivian\nReznik and Andrew Ries, have\nalways supported my love of\ntechnology while still insisting on\nthe importance of a liberal arts\neducation. Without their constant\nlove and support, I would never have\nhad the courage to step into the void\nof entrepreneurship or have found\nmy own voice as a writer. I know my\ngrandparents have been with me\nevery step of this journey—they\nbelieved deeply in the power of\nwriting and took supreme joy in my\nsisters’ and my every\naccomplishment. To my sisters\nNicole and Amanda and my brotherin-law Dov, I can only say: thank\nyou for supporting me all these\nyears.\nMy wife, Tara Sophia Mohr, has\nbeen a constant source of joy and\ncomfort every step of the way. She\nhas experienced every stress, every\nhigh, and every low through this very\nlengthy process. Tara, you are an\nincredibly brilliant, strong, and\ncompassionate woman. Words\ncannot express how much I\nappreciate your steadfast support,\nyour overwhelming love, and the\ndaily adventure that is our life\ntogether.

The truth is down there somewhere, but it’s fragile. While\neach blow with your shovel gets you closer to the truth, you’re liable to smash it\ninto a million little pieces if you use too blunt an instrument.\nI see a lot of teams using a bulldozer and crate of dynamite for their excavation.\nThey are, in one way or another, forcing people to say something nice about\ntheir business. They use heavy-handed questions like “do you think it’s a good\nidea” and shatter their prize.\nAt the other end of the spectrum, some founders are using a toothbrush to\nunearth a city, flinching away from digging deep and finding out whether\nanything of value is actually buried down there.\nWe want to find the truth of how to make our business succeed. We need to dig\nfor it—and dig deep—but every question we ask carries the very real possibility\nof biasing the person we’re talking to and rendering the whole exercise pointless.\nIt happens more than you’d ever imagine.\nThe truth is our goal and questions are our tools. But we must learn to wield\nthem. It’s delicate work. And well worth learning. There’s treasure below.\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 4\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nIs this book for you?\nHello,\nYou’ve read about Customer Development or Lean Startup and aren’t sure how\nto actually go about having your first customer conversation.\nYou’re a traditional business or sales person aiming to be more effective within a\nyoung company which hasn’t yet found its business model.\nYou mentor, support, or invest in startups and want to help them have more\nuseful customer conversations.\nYou’ve fallen in love with a new business idea and want to figure out if it has legs\nbefore quitting your job.\nYou’re raising funding and the investors want to see more evidence that you’re\nsolving a real problem.\nYou find this whole process incredibly awkward and really wish there was an\neasier way to do it.\nYou’ve got a vague sense of an opportunity and want to figure out exactly what\nit is.\nYou’ve always wanted to build your own company and want to start making real\nprogress today.\nThis book is for you.\nTalking to customers is hard\nWe know we ought to talk to customers. Many of us even do talk to customers.\nBut we still end up building stuff nobody buys. Isn’t that exactly what talking to\npeople is meant to prevent?\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 5\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nIt turns out almost all of us are doing it wrong. I’ve made these mistakes myself\nand seen them happen a hundred times over with other founders. Despite the\nrecent explosion of startup knowledge, the process of figuring out what\ncustomers want too often unfolds as it did at my first company, Habit.\nWe were building social advertising tech and I was distraught. We'd spent 3\nyears working our hearts out. We’d nearly run out of investor money and it\ndidn’t look like we’d be getting more. We’d relocated internationally to be closer\nto our market and had survived a co-founder being deported. I’d been talking to\ncustomers full-time for months. And then, after innumerable days of slog and an\nexhausted team, I learned I’d been doing it wrong. I may as well not have\nbothered.\nThe advice that you ought to be talking to your customers is well-intentioned,\nbut ultimately a bit unhelpful. It’s like the popular kid advising his nerdy friend\nto “just be cooler.” They forget to mention that it’s hard.\nThese conversations take time, are easy to screw up and go wrong in a nefarious\nway. Bad customer conversations aren’t just useless. Worse, they convince you\nthat you’re on the right path. They give you a false positive which causes you to\nover-invest your cash, your time, and your team. Even when you’re not actively\nscrewing something up, those pesky customers seem hellbent on lying to you.\nThis book is a practical how-to. The approach and tools within are gathered\nfrom a wide range of communities including Customer Development, Design\nThinking, Lean Startup, User Experience, traditional sales and more. It’s based\non working with a bunch of founders and from my experiences both failing and\nsucceeding at customer learning, as well as from the support of innumerable\npeers and mentors.\nIt’s a casual approach to conversation, based on chipping away the formality\nand awkwardness of talking to people and taking responsibility for asking good\nquestions.\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 6\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nWhy another book on\ntalking and selling?\nDoes your shelf really need another book on selling and talking? And does it\nneed one written by me in particular?\nWell… yes. Yes it does.\nHere’s why:\nFirstly, I’m a techie, not a sales guy. I’m introverted and naturally bad in\nmeetings. Every other sales book I've read is written by and for folks who are\nalready pretty good at dealing with people. They know the unspoken rules of\nthe meeting. I fumbled through from scratch. You know that line, “Don’t call\nme, I’ll call you”? People have actually said that to me (and I believed them).\nWith much help from peers and advisors, I eventually started figuring it out and\nwe closed deals with companies like Sony and MTV. But I learned that there’s a\nbig gap between textbooks and check books.\nSecondly, before we can start doing things correctly, we need to understand how\nwe’re doing them wrong. Through my own projects and my work with new\nfounders, I’ve built up an exhaustive list of how it can go wrong. Throughout\nthe book, I’ll try to help you figure out where you might be messing stuff up in\nunnoticed ways.\nFinally, this is a practical handbook, not a theoretical tome. For example, how\ndo you find people to talk to and set up the meetings? How do you take notes\nwhile still being polite and paying attention? It’s all in here.\nI can’t teach you how to make your business huge. That’s up to you. But I can\ngive you the tools to talk to customers, navigate the noise, and learn what they\nreally want. The saddest thing that can happen to a startup is for nobody to care\nwhen it disappears. We’re going to make sure that doesn’t happen.\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 7\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nA note on scope & terminology\nThis book isn’t a summary or description or re-interpretation of the process of\nCustomer Development. That’s a bigger concept and something Steve Blank\nhas covered comprehensively in 4 Steps to the E.piphany and The Startup Owner’s\nManual.\nThis book is specifically about how to properly talk to customers and learn from\nthem. Talking is one of the big aspects of Customer Development, but shouldn't\nbe confused with the whole process. To keep the distinction clear, I’m going to\nrefer to chatting with people as “customer conversation” (lowercase) instead of\n“Customer Development” (uppercase).\nFor the most part, I'm assuming you already agree that talking to customers is a\ngood idea. I’m not trying to convince you again, so this book is more “how”\nthan “why”.\nLet’s get involved.\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 8\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nCHAPTER ONE\nThe Mom Test\nPeople say you shouldn’t ask your mom whether your business is a good idea.\nThat’s technically true, but it misses the point. You shouldn’t ask anyone whether\nyour business is a good idea. At least not in those words. Your mom will lie to\nyou the most (just ‘cuz she loves you), but it’s a bad question and invites everyone\nto lie to you at least a little.\nIt’s not anyone else’s responsibility to show us the truth. It’s our responsibility to\nfind it. We do that by asking good questions.\nThe Mom Test is a set of simple rules for crafting good questions that even your\nmom can't lie to you about.\nBefore we get there, let's look at two conversations with mom and see what we\ncan learn about our business idea: digital cookbooks for the iPad.\nFailing the mom test\nSon: “Mom, mom, I have an idea for a business — can I run it by\nyou?” I am about to expose my ego — please don’t hurt my feelings.\nMom: “Of course, dear.” You are my only son and I am ready to lie to protect you.\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 9\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nSon: “You like your iPad, right? You use it a lot?”\nMom: “Yes.” You led me to this answer, so here you go.\nSon: “Okay, so would you ever buy an app which was like a cookbook\nfor your iPad?” I am optimistically asking a hypothetical question and you know\nwhat I want you to say.\nMom: “Hmmm.” As if I need another cookbook at my age.\nSon: “And it only costs $40 — that’s cheaper than those hardcovers on\nyour shelf.” I’m going to skip that lukewarm signal and tell you more about my\ngreat idea.\nMom: “Well...” Aren’t apps supposed to cost a dollar?\nSon: “And you can share recipes with your friends, and there’s an\niPhone app which is your shopping list. And videos of that celebrity\nchef you love.” Please just say “yes.” I will not leave you alone until you do.\nMom: “Oh, well yes honey, that sounds amazing. And you’re right, $40 is\na good deal. Will it have pictures of the recipes?” I have rationalised the\nprice outside of a real purchase decision, made a non-committal compliment, and\noffered a feature request to appear engaged.\nSon: “Yes, definitely. Thanks mom — love you!” I have completely misinterpreted this conversation and taken it as validation.\nMom: “Won’t you have some lasagna?” I am concerned that you won’t be able\nto afford food soon. Please eat something.\nOur misguided entrepreneur has a few more conversations like this, becomes\nincreasingly convinced he’s right, quits his job, and sinks his savings into the app.\nThen he wonders why nobody (even his mom) buys the app, especially since he\nhad been so rigorous.\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 10\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nDoing it wrong is worse than doing nothing at all. When you know you’re\nclueless, you tend to be careful. But collecting a fistful of false positives is like\nconvincing a drunk he’s sober: not an improvement.\nLet’s fix the conversation and show that if we do it right, even mom can help us\nfigure out whether our business is a good idea.\nPassing the mom test\nSon: “Hey mom, how’s that new iPad treating you?”\nMom: “Oh - I love it! I use it every day.”\nSon: “What do you usually do on it?” Whoops — we asked a generic\nquestion, so answer to this probably won’t be terribly valuable.\nMom: “Oh, you know. Read the news, play sudoku, catch up with my\nfriends. The usual.”\nSon: “What’s the last thing you did on it?” Get specific about examples in the\npast to get real, concrete data.\nMom: “You know your father and I are planning that trip? I was figuring\nout where we could stay. “ She uses it for both entertainment and utility, which\ndidn’t come up during the “usually” answer.\nSon: “Did you use an app for that?” A slightly leading question, but sometimes\nwe need to nudge to get to the topic we’re interested in.\nMom: “No, I just used Google. I didn’t know there was an app. What’s it\ncalled?” Younger folks use the App Store as a search engine, whereas your mom\nwaits for a specific recommendation. If that’s true more broadly, finding a reliable\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 11\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nmarketing channel outside the App Store is going to be crucial.\nSon: “Where did you find out about the other ones you use?” Dig into\ninteresting and unexpected answers to understand the behaviours and motivations\nbehind them.\nMom: “The Sunday paper has a section on the apps of the week.” You\ncan’t remember the last time you cracked open a paper, but it sounds like traditional\nPR might be a viable option for reaching customers like your mom.\nSon: “Makes sense. Hey, by the way, I saw a couple new cookbooks on\nthe shelf — where did those come from?” Business ideas usually have\nseveral failure points. Here it’s both the medium of an iPad app and the content of\na cookbook.\nMom: “They’re one of those things you just end up getting at Christmas.\nI think Marcy gave me that one. Haven’t even opened it. As if I need\nanother lasagna recipe at my age!” Aha! This answer is gold dust for 3\nreasons: 1. Old people don’t need another generic set of recipes. 2. The gift market\nmay be strong . 3. Younger cooks may be a better customer segment since they don’t\nyet know the basics.\nSon: “What’s the last cookbook you did buy for yourself ?” Attack generic\nanswers like “I don’t buy cookbooks” by asking for specific examples.\nMom: “Now that you mention it, I bought a vegan cookbook about 3\nmonths ago. Your father is trying to eat healthier and thought my\nveggies could benefit from a pinch more zazz.” More gold: experienced\nchefs may still buy specialised or niche cookbooks.\nThe conversation continues. If it’s going well, I would raise the topics of\nwhether she ever thought to look for recipes on the iPad or for cooking videos\non YouTube.\nOverall, your mom can’t remember the last time she had such an enjoyable\nconversation with you. You were so interested in her life for once! You thank her\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 12\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nfor the lasagna, pet the dog, and head home. You’ve learned that building an\napp and waiting for people to find it on the App Store probably isn’t a good\nplan. But you’ve got some good insight about your customer segment and a few\npromising leads to look into. That was a useful conversation.\nA useful conversation\nThe measure of usefulness of an early customer conversation is whether it gives\nus concrete facts about our customers' lives and world views. These facts, in\nturn, allow us to improve our business.\nOur original idea looked like this: old people like cookbooks and iPads.\nTherefore, we will build a cookbook for the iPad. It’s generic. There are a\nthousand possible variations of this premise.\nWith an idea this vague, we can’t answer any of the difficult questions like which\nrecipes to include or how people will hear about it. Until we get specific, it\nalways seems like a good idea.\nAfter just one conversation (with our mom, of all people), we have a higher\nfidelity vision. We now see that there are at least 2 specific customer segments\nwe might serve, each of which needs a slightly different product. We’ve also\nidentified some major risks to address before we commit too heavily.\n1. We could offer niche recipes (ethnic, diets) which experienced cooks may\nnot already know. Our biggest question is how to reach them when they\ndon’t search for apps. We have a possible lead with newspaper and\nmagazine PR.\n2. Alternately, we might make generic recipes for younger cooks who are\neasier to reach via the App Store and who haven’t memorised all their\nfavourites yet. We haven’t talked to any, so we have loads of questions, but\none big one is whether a customer segment who isn’t already in the habit\nof buying expensive cookbooks will pay a premium for ours.\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 13\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nThe first conversation gave us rope to hang ourselves. The second gave us\nactionable insight. Why? What was different about the second conversation?\nMom was unable to lie to us because we never talked about our idea.\nThat’s kind of weird, right? We find out if people care about what we’re doing\nby never mentioning it. Instead, we talk about them and their lives.\nThe point is a bit more subtle than this. Eventually you do need to mention\nwhat you’re building and take people’s money for it. However, the big mistake is\nalmost always to mention your idea too soon rather than too late.\nIf you just avoid mentioning your idea, you automatically start asking better\nquestions. Doing this is the easiest (and biggest) improvement you can make to\nyour customer conversations.\nHere are 3 simple rules to help you. They are collectively called (drumroll) The\nMom Test:\nThe Mom Test:\n1. Talk about their life instead of your idea\n2. Ask about specifics in the past instead of generics or opinions about the\nfuture\n3. Talk less and listen more\nIt’s called The Mom Test because it leads to questions that even your mom can’t\nlie to you about. When you do it right, they won’t even know you have an idea.\nThere are some other important tools and tricks that we’ll introduce throughout\nthe rest of the book. But first, let’s let’s put The Mom Test to work on some\nquestions.\nRule of thumb: Customer conversations are bad by default. It’s your job to fix\nthem.\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 14\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nGood question / bad\nquestion\nLet’s play a game. Are the following questions good or bad? Do they pass or fail\nThe Mom Test? If they fail it, why? And how could we improve them? Work\nyour way through the list and then read on for some discussion.\n“Do you think it’s a good idea?”\n“Would you buy a product which did X?”\n“How much would you pay for X?”\n“What would your dream product do?”\n“Why do you bother?”\n“What are the implications of that?”\n“Talk me through the last time that happened.”\n“Talk me through your workflow.”\n“What else have you tried?”\n“Would you pay X for a product which did Y?”\n“How are you dealing with it now?”\n“Where does the money come from?”\n“Who else should I talk to?”\n“Is there anything else I should have asked?”\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 15\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\n\"Do you think it's a good idea?\"\nAwful question! Here’s the thing: only the market can tell if your idea is good.\nEverything else is just opinion. Unless you’re talking to a deep industry expert,\nthis is self-indulgent noise with a high risk of false positives.\nLet’s fix it: Say you’re building an app to help construction companies manage\ntheir suppliers. You might ask them to show you how they currently do it. Talk\nabout which parts they love and hate. Ask which other tools and processes they\ntried before settling on this one. Are they actively searching for a replacement?\nIf so, what’s the sticking point? If not, why not? Where are they losing money\nwith their current tools? Is there a budget for better ones? Now, take all that\ninformation and decide for yourself whether it’s a good idea.\nRule of thumb: Opinions are worthless.\n\"Would you buy a product which did X?\"\nBad question. You’re asking for opinions and hypotheticals from overly\noptimistic people who want to make you happy. The answer to a question like\nthis is almost always “yes”, which makes it worthless.\nLet’s fix it: Ask how they currently solve X and how much it costs them to do so.\nAnd how much time it takes. Ask them to talk you through what happened the\nlast time X came up. If they haven’t solved the problem, ask why not. Have they\ntried searching for solutions and found them wanting? Or do they not even care\nenough to have Googled for it?\nRule of thumb: Anything involving the future is an over-optimistic lie.\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 16\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\n\"How much would you pay for X?\"\nBad question. This is exactly as bad as the last one, except it’s more likely to\ntrick you because the number makes it feel rigorous and truthy.\nHow to fix it: Just like the others, fix it by asking about their life as it already is.\nHow much does the problem cost them? How much do they currently pay to\nsolve it? How big is the budget they’ve allocated? I hope you’re noticing a trend\nhere.\nRule of thumb: People will lie to you if they think it’s what you want to hear.\n\"What would your dream product do?\"\nSort-of-okay question, but only if you ask good follow-ups. Otherwise it’s a\nbad question. A question like this is like the “set” before the spike in a volleyball\ngame: not too helpful on its own, but it puts you in a good position as long as\nyou’re ready to exploit it.\nLet’s improve it: The value comes from understanding why they want these\nfeatures. You don’t want to just collect feature requests. You aren’t building the\nproduct by committee. But the motivations and constraints behind those\nrequests are critical.\nRule of thumb: People know what their problems are, but they don’t know how to\nsolve those problems.\n\"Why do you bother?\"\nGood question. I love this sort of question. It’s great for getting from the\nperceived problem to the real one.\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 17\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nFor example, some founders I knew were talking to finance guys spending hours\neach day sending emails about their spreadsheets. The finance guys were asking\nfor better messaging tools so they could save time. The “why do you bother”\nquestion led to “so we can be certain that we’re all working off the latest\nversion.” Aha. The solution ended up being less like the requested messaging\ntool and more like Dropbox. A question like “why do you bother” points toward\ntheir motivations. It gives you the why.\nRule of thumb: You're shooting blind until you understand their goals.\n\"What are the implications of that?\"\nGood question. This distinguishes between I-will-pay-to-solve-that problems\nand thats-kind-of-annoying-but-I-can-deal-with-it “problems”. Some problems\nhave big, costly implications. Others exist but don’t actually matter. It behooves\nyou to find out which is which. It also gives you a good pricing signal.\nI once had someone keep describing the workflow we were fixing with\nemotionally loaded terms like “DISASTER”, accompanied by much yelling and\narm waving. But when I asked him what the implications were, he sort of\nshrugged and said “Oh, we just ended up throwing a bunch of interns at the\nproblem—it’s actually working pretty well.”\nRule of thumb: Some problems don’t actually matter.\n\"Talk me through the last time that happened.\"\nGood question. Your high school writing teacher may have told you that good\nstories are meant to “show, not tell”. Whenever possible, you want to be shown,\nnot told by your customers. Learn through their actions instead of their\nopinions. If you ran a burger joint, it would be stupid to survey your customers\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 18\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nabout whether they prefer cheeseburgers or hamburgers. Just watch what they\nbuy (but if you’re trying to understand why they prefer one over the other, you’ll\nhave to talk to them).\nFolks can’t be wishy-washy when you’re watching them do the task in question.\nGet as close to the real action as you can. Seeing it first hand can provide unique\ninsight into murky situations. But if you can’t get in there, asking them to talk\nyou through the last time it happened still offers many of the benefits.\nBeing walked through their full workflow answers many questions in one fell\nswoop: how do they spend their days, what tools do they use, and who do they\ntalk to? What are the constraints of their day and life? How does your product\nfit into that day? Which other tools, products, software, and tasks does your\nproduct need to integrate with?\nRule of thumb: Watching someone do a task will show you where the problems\nand inefficiencies really are, not where the customer thinks they are.\n\"What else have you tried?\"\nGood question. What are they using now? How much does it cost and what\ndo they love and hate about it? How much would those fixes be worth and how\nbig of a pain would it be for them to switch to a new solution?\nI was checking out an idea with a potential customer and they excitedly said,\n“Oh man, that happens all the time. I would definitely pay for something which\nsolved that problem.”\nThat’s a future-promise statement without any commitment to back it up, so I\nneeded to learn whether it was true or not. I asked, “When’s the last time this\ncame up?” Turns out, it was pretty recent. That’s a great sign. To dig further, I\nasked, “Can you talk me through how you tried to fix it?” He looked at me\nblankly, so I nudged him further.\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 19\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\n“Did you google around for any other ways to solve it?” He seemed a little bit\nlike he’d been caught stealing from the cookie jar and said, “No… I didn’t really\nthink to. It’s something I’m used to dealing with, you know?”\nIn the abstract, it’s something he would “definitely” pay to solve. Once we got\nspecific, he didn't even care enough to search for a solution (which do exist,\nincidentally).\nIt’s easy to get someone emotional about a problem if you lead them there.\n“Don’t you hate when your shoelaces come untied while you’re carrying\ngroceries?” “Yeah, that’s the worst!” And then I go off and design my special\nnever-come-untied laces without realising that if you actually cared, you would\nalready be using a double-knot.\nRule of thumb: If they haven't looked for ways of solving it already, they're not\ngoing to look for (or buy) yours.\n\"Would you pay X for a product which did Y?\"\nBad question. The fact that you’ve added a number doesn’t help. This is bad\nfor the same reasons as the others: people are overly optimistic about what they\nwould do and want to make you happy. Plus, it’s about your idea instead of their\nlife.\nLet’s fix it: As always, ask about what they currently do now, not what they\nbelieve they might do in the future. Common wisdom is that you price your\nproduct in terms of value to the customer rather than cost to you. That's true.\nAnd you can't quantify the value received without prodding their financial\nworldview.\nAnother way to fix it, if you’re far enough along, is to literally ask for money. If\nyou have the deposit or pre-order in hand, you know they were telling the truth.\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 20\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\n\"How are you dealing with it now?\"\nGood question. Beyond workflow information, this gives you a price anchor.\nIf they’re paying £100/month for a duct-tape workaround, you know which\nballpark you're playing in. On the other hand, they may have spent £120,000\nthis year on agency fees to maintain a site you're replacing. If that's the case, you\ndon't want to be having the £100 conversation.\nSometimes, both of the above will be happening simultaneously and you get to\nchoose how you present yourself. Do you want to be a replacement for the web\napp at a yearly value of £1.2k or for the agency at 100x that?\nRule of thumb: While it’s rare for someone to tell you precisely what they’ll pay\nyou, they’ll often show you what it’s worth to them.\n\"Where does the money come from?\"\nGood question. This isn't something you would necessarily ask a consumer\n(though you might), but in a B2B context it’s a must-ask. It leads to a\nconversation about whose budget the purchase will come from and who else\nwithin their company holds the power to torpedo the deal.\nOften, you'll find yourself talking to someone other than the budget owner. Your\nfuture pitches will hit unseen snags unless you learn who else matters and what\nthey care about. This knowledge of their purchasing process will eventually turn\ninto a repeatable sales roadmap.\n\"Who else should I talk to?\"\nGood question. Yes! End every conversation like this. Lining up the first few\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 21\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nconversations can be challenging, but if you’re onto something interesting and\ntreating people well, your leads will quickly multiply via intros.\nIf someone doesn’t want to make intros, that’s cool too. Just leave them be.\nYou’ve learned that you’re either screwing up the meeting (probably by being\ntoo formal, pitchy, or clingy) or they don’t actually care about the problem\nyou’re solving. Take anything nice they say with an extra grain of salt.\n\"Is there anything else I should have asked?\"\nGood question. Usually, by the end of the meeting, people understand what\nyou’re trying to do. Since you don’t know the industry, they’ll often be sitting\nthere quietly while you completely miss the most important point.\nAsking this question gives them a chance to politely “fix” your line of\nquestioning. And they will!\nThis question is a bit of a crutch: you’ll discard it as you get better at asking\ngood questions and as you get to know the industry.\nRule of thumb: People want to help you, but will rarely do so unless you give them\nan excuse to do so.\nUsing the mom test\nYou’ll notice that none of the good questions were about asking what you\nshould build. One of the recurring “criticisms” about talking to customers is\nthat you’re abdicating your creative vision and building your product by\ncommittee. Given that people don’t know what they want, that wouldn’t be a\nterribly effective approach. Deciding what to build is your job.\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 22\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nThe questions to ask are about your customers’ lives: their problems, cares,\nconstraints, and goals. You humbly and honestly gather as much information\nabout them as you can and then take your own visionary leap to a solution.\nOnce you’ve taken the leap, you confirm that it’s correct (and refine it) through\nCommitment & Advancement, which we’ll look at in Chapter 5.\nIt boils down to this: you aren’t allowed to tell them what their problem is, and\nin return, they aren’t allowed to tell you what to build. They own the problem,\nyou own the solution.\nBefore we move look at ways to confirm that you’re building the right product to\nfit your customers’ lives, we’re going to look at fixing some of the ways\nconversations go wrong.\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 23\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nCHAPTER TWO\nAvoiding bad\ndata\nThey say that to bankrupt a fool, give him information. Practically everyone I’ve\nseen talk to customers (including myself) has been giving themselves bad\ninformation. You probably are too. Bad data gives us false negatives (thinking\nthe idea is dead when it’s not) and—more dangerously—false positives\n(convincing yourself you’re right when you’re not).\nThere are 3 types of bad data to watch out for:\n1. Compliments\n2. Fluff (generics, hypotheticals, and the future)\n3. Ideas\nSometimes we invite the bad data ourselves by asking the wrong questions, but\neven when you try to follow The Mom Test, conversations still go off track. It\ncould happen because you got excited and started pitching, because you had to\ntalk about your idea to explain the reason for the meeting, or because the\nconversation is just stuck in hypothetical la-la-land.\nThese things will happen. Once you start to notice the noise, it’s easy to get back\non track by deflecting compliments, anchoring fluff, and digging beneath ideas.\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 24\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nDeflect compliments\nMost of your meetings will end with a compliment. It feels good. They said they\nliked it!\nUnfortunately, they’re almost certainly lying. Not necessarily intentionally. They\nmight want to be supportive or to protect your feelings. Or your excitement\nmight be rubbing off on them.\nEven if they really do like it, that data is still worthless. For example, venture\ncapitalists (professional judges of the future) are wrong far more than right. If\neven a VC's opinion is probably wrong, what weight could that of some random\nguy's possibly have?\nWith the exception of industry experts who have built very similar businesses,\nopinions are worthless. You want facts and commitments, not compliments.\nThe best way to escape the misinformation of compliments is to avoid them\ncompletely by not mentioning your idea. If they happen anyway, you need to\ndeflect the compliment and get on with the business of gathering facts and\ncommitments.\nBefore we look at how to properly deflect compliments, here's what happens\nwhen you take them at face value:\nA bad conversation:\nYou: “…And that’s it. It’s like X for Y, but better because of Z.” Bam!\nTotally nailed that pitch.\nThem: “That’s really cool. I love it.” How is this even relevant to me?\n(Compliment)\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 25\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nYou: “It’s going to totally change the way you work. We’re predicting\ncost savings of 35%.” I am so great.\nThem: “Sounds terrific. Keep me in the loop.” I can’t believe I keep agreeing\nto these startup pitches. (Compliment + stalling tactic)\nYou: “Awesome, thanks.” I’m just like Steve Jobs. Except more handsome.\nYou: (Back at the office) “That meeting went really well. They said they\nloved it! In fact, everybody loves it. I really think we’ve finally found\nour big idea. We’ve found something people want.” It’s margarita time!\nYour Team: (6 months later) “Why do we have zero customers? I\nthought you said everybody loved it?” Wasn’t this your job?\nYou: “I don’t know, I talked to like a thousand people. I must have\nmissed one of their buying criteria. Don’t worry, I’ll go talk to them\nsome more and we’ll get it next time.” Doooooomed.\nLet’s try that again while properly deflecting the confounding compliments:\nA good conversation:\nYou: “…And that’s it. It’s like X for Y, but better because of Z.” Rats, I\njust slipped into pitch mode. Let’s try to recover this and learn something.\nThem: “That’s really cool. I love it.” How is this even relevant to me?\n(Compliment)\nYou: “Whoops — really sorry about that — I got excited and started\npitching. Listen: you guys seem to be doing a good job in this space —\ndo you mind if I ask how you’re dealing with this stuff at the\nmoment?” That compliment made me suspicious. Let's deflect it and find out\nwhether they're a potential customer or are just trying to get rid of me.\nThem: “What? Oh, well, sure. We’ve got a couple people who manage\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 26\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nthe process just to make sure we’re all in sync, and then we use Excel\nand a lot of emails to keep it all moving. Anyway, I really like your\nidea. I’m sure it will do well.” If you want facts, here they are, but your idea\nstill isn’t a good fit for me and there’s no way I’m going to express an interest in\nbuying (notice the sneaky compliment at the end).\nYou: “I haven’t heard of anyone solving it quite like that — that’s\ninteresting. Can you talk me through how it actually all fits together?”\nLet's ignore & deflect that compliment to focus on the fact that they’re spending a lot\nof money to solve this. Two full time staff!? I didn’t know it was worth this much.\nThem: (More delicious workflow data)\nYou: “What sort of difficulties have come up with that solution?” This is\na bit generic and isn’t the world’s greatest question, but I’m trying to find an anchor\nto learn about workflow inefficiencies and bumps. When I find one, I’ll dig around\nthat signal with more follow-ups.\nThem: (Even more workflow and alternate solution data)\nIf we’re early in the learning process, the meeting could end here quite happily.\nWe have the learning we came for. If we were slightly later-stage and already\nhad a product, we might continue by zooming in and pushing for commitments\nor sales.\nRemember though: you don’t need to end up with what you wanted to hear in\norder to have a good conversation. You just need to get to the truth. Here’s a\ngood conversation with a solid negative result.\nA good (negative) conversation:\nThem: “That’s really cool. I love it.” Compliment.\nYou: “How are you dealing with this stuff at the moment?” Deflect that\ncompliment and get to the real facts.\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 27\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nThem: “Oh, it’s really not that big of a deal for us. We kind of just\nignore it.” The implications of the problem are non-existent so I’m not in the\nmarket for a solution.\nYou can always be happy with a conversation like the above. You saw through\nthe false compliment and found the facts behind the mirage. If the conversation\nis going well, I’d try to have them talk me through their process anyway so I can\ntry to figure out whether it’s an industry wide non-problem or something specific\nto their particular situation.\nDid you notice that in the conversations above, practically every response\ncontains a sneaky compliment? They are pervasive, constantly trying to trick us\ninto thinking the conversation “went well”.\nIgnoring compliments should be easy, but it’s not. We so desperately want to\nhear them that we are often tricked into registering them as positive data points\ninstead of vacuous fibs. Sometimes it’s easier to spot the symptoms than to\nnotice the original compliment.\nSymptoms (in the meeting):\n• “Thanks!”\n• “I’m glad you like it.”\nSymptoms (back at the office):\n• “That meeting went really well.”\n• “We’re getting a lot of positive feedback.”\n• “Everybody I’ve talked to loves the idea.”\nAll of these are warning signs. If you catch yourself or your teammates saying\nsomething like this, try to get specific. Why did that person like the idea? How\nmuch money would it save him? How would it fit into his life? What else has he\ntried which failed to solve his problem? If you don’t know, then you’ve got a\ncompliment instead of real data.\nRule of thumb: Compliments are the fool’s gold of customer learning: shiny,\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 28\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\ndistracting, and entirely worthless.\nAnchor fluff\nFluff comes in 3 cuddly shapes:\n• Generic claims (“I usually”, \"I always\", \"I never\")\n• Future-tense promises (“I would”, \"I will\")\n• Hypothetical maybes (\"I might\", \"I could\")\nWhen someone starts talking about what they “always” or “usually” or “never”\nor “would” do, they are giving you generic and hypothetical fluff. Just follow\nThe Mom Test and bring them back to specifics in the past. Ask when it last\nhappened, for them to talk you through it, how they solved it, and what else they\ntried.\nThe world’s most deadly fluff is: “I would definitely buy that.”\nIt just sounds so concrete. As a founder, you desperately want to believe it’s money\nin the bank. But folks are wildly optimistic about what they would do in the\nfuture. They’re always more positive, excited, and willing to pay in the imagined\nfuture than they are once it arrives.\nThe first startup I worked at fell for the “I would definitely buy that” trap and\nsubsequently lost about 10 million bucks. They mistook fluffy future promises\nand excited compliments for commitment, wrongly believed they had proven\nthemselves right, and wildly over-invested.\nThe worst type of fluff-inducing question you can ask is, “Would you ever?” Of\ncourse they might. Someday. That doesn't mean they will. Fluff-inducing\nquestions include:\n• “Do you ever…”\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 29\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\n• “Would you ever…”\n• “What do you usually…”\n• “Do you think you…”\n• “Might you…”\n• “Could you see yourself…”\nYou don’t need to avoid these questions 100% of the time. They aren’t exactly\ntoxic. It’s just that the responses to them are useless. The mistake is in valuing\nthe answers, not in asking the questions. In fact, sometimes these questions can\nhelp the tempo when you’re transitioning into more concrete questioning. Here’s\nan example.\nTransitioning from a fluffy question to a concrete one:\nYou: “Do you ever X?” A fluff-inducing question.\nThem: “Oh yeah, all the time.” A fluffy answer which has no value in itself, but\nwhich we can anchor from.\nYou: “When’s the last time that happened?” We use the Mom Test and ask\nfor concrete examples in the past.\nThem: “Two weekends ago.” We’ve successfully anchored the fluff and are\nready to get real facts now instead of generics and hypotheticals.\nYou: “Can you talk me through that?” Back to asking good questions.\nTo use a more tangible example, let’s say you’re designing some sort of inbox\nmanagement tool:\nA good conversation, anchoring generic fluff:\nThem: “I’m an ‘Inbox 0’ zealot. It’s totally changed my life.” A generic\n(e.g. fluffy) claim.\nYou: “Haha, nice. I’m an ‘Inbox 0’ failure. What’s your inbox at right\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 30\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nnow?” Let’s get specific to see if this fluff holds up.\nThem: “Looks like about ten that have come in since this morning.”\nFacts!\nYou: “Okay wow, so you are on top of things. I have like 200 right now.\nWhen’s the last time it totally fell apart for you?” He’s still claiming to be\non top of his email, so I’m going to look for concrete examples where he wasn’t.\nThem: “Ug, 3 weeks ago. I was travelling and the internet at the hotel\ntotally didn’t work. It took me like 10 days to get back on track.”\nYou: “Can you talk me through how you handled it?” Successfully\nanchored — now we’re talking about what actually happens instead of what\n“usually” happens.\nIn this case, we took the generic claim, “My inbox is always under control” and\nadded the important caveat: “Except when it’s not, in which case it’s a total\nnightmare to recover from.” While using generics, people describe themselves as\nwho they want to be, not who they actually are. You need to get specific to bring\nout the edge cases.\nLet’s say you’re building a mobile loyalty app to help stores give deals and\ndiscounts to their most loyal customers and you hear the guy in line in front of\nyou complaining:\nA bad conversation (pitching and accepting fluff):\nThem: “Which idiot decided it was a good idea to make me carry\naround a thousand cafe loyalty cards?”\nYou: “Whoa! Hey! I’m building a mobile app to help stores give out\ndiscounts to their most loyal customers so you’d never need to carry\npaper cards again. Do you think you would use something like that?”\nThis is pretty much as bad of a question as you can find. You’ve revealed your ego\nand asked a “would you ever” question. You’re begging for a false positive.\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 31\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nThem: “Heck yes, it's about time! I would definitely use that.” Fluffy\nhypothetical future promise!\nBy switching into pitch mode, we just wasted a perfectly good opportunity for\nlearning and instead got a fistful of fluff. Let’s try again.\nA good conversation:\nThem: “What idiot decided it was a good idea to make me carry around\na thousand cafe loyalty cards?”\nYou: “It’s crazy, right? My wallet is like two feet thick. Hey — have you\never tried any of those loyalty apps for your phone?” Anchor to past\nbehaviours.\nThem: “Those exist?” Perhaps my rage is misplaced…\nYou: “Yeah, I’m sure you’ve seen the little signs for that one in the\ncampus cafe.”\nThem: “Oh yeah, I remember that. I’m always kind of in a rush.” This\nis a nice bit of customer insight about their state of mind and circumstances when\nyou’re trying to advertise to them.\nYou: “Why don’t you download it now?” If someone’s being flaky, put them\nto a decision. If they don’t care enough to try solving their problem already, they\naren’t going to care about your solution.\nThem: “I’ll do it next time.” Not a real problem.\nYou can’t help but laugh when you hear this one. “Someone should definitely\nmake an X!” “Have you looked for an X?” “No, why?” “There are like 10\ndifferent kinds of X.” “Well I didn't really need it anyway.”\nLong story short, that person is a complainer, not a customer. They’re stuck in\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 32\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nthe la-la-land of imagining they’re the sort of person who finds clever ways to\nsolve the petty annoyances of their day.\nBeyond rousting some poor soul’s consumeristic hypocrisy, anchoring the fluff\ncan also yield useful signals:\nYou: “…Have you ever tried any of those loyalty apps for your phone?”\nThem: “Yeah, I downloaded a couple of them. You need a different one\nfor every chain. I don’t want a hundred apps clogging up my phone\nany more than I want a bunch of cards in my wallet.”\nSo he’s an actively searching potential user, but we’d need to get critical mass\nwith the stores he goes to before he'll be happy. Maybe we could take over a\nsmall university town first. Or he might say:\nThem: “I looked into it, but you only end up getting like a 10%\ndiscount. That seems less like a loyalty reward and more like a cheap\nway for them to collect a bunch of data about me.”\nSo he was on the fence, but needs better perks. Maybe we could find a way to\nforce merchants into deeper discounts like Groupon was able to do. He also has\nprivacy concerns. Or he could respond with:\nThem: “Have you ever actually tried using that app? It's abysmal. It\ntakes me longer to find the stupid button than to buy my coffee.”\nSo all we need to do (for this particular user) is to out-execute and simplify. We\ncould try to be the Instagram to their flickr.\nThe list goes on. There are tons of useful responses you can get. Even learning\nthat the person is a non-customer is useful. To get toward this truth, you just\nneed to reject their generic claims, incidental complaints, and fluffy promises.\nInstead, anchor them toward the life they already lead and the actions they’re\nalready taking.\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 33\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nDig beneath ideas\nEntrepreneurs are always drowning in ideas. We have too many ideas, not too\nfew. Still, folks adore giving us more. At some point during a good conversation,\nthe person you’re talking to may “flip” to your side of the table. This is good\nnews. They are excited and see the potential, so they’ll start listing tons of ideas,\npossibilities and feature requests.\nWrite them down, but don’t rush to add them to your todo list. Startups are\nabout focusing and executing on a single, scalable idea rather than jumping on\nevery good one which crosses your desk.\nLet’s say you’re mid-conversation when this idea drops:\nThem: “Are you guys going to be able to sync to Excel? I really think\nthat’s the a killer feature.”\nWhat do you do here? The wrong response is to write “sync to Excel” on your\ntodo list and then move on. That’s the fast-lane to feature-creep. Instead, take a\nmoment to dig into the motivations behind the request.\nYou: “What would syncing to Excel allow you to do?” Maybe there’s an\neasier way I can help you achieve the same thing.\nThem: “We’ve got all these legacy reports and we need to go through\nthem every now and then. It would be nice to have everything in one\nplace, you know?” Don’t worry, it’s not a key buying criteria.\nOr they might say:\nThem: “We’ve tried a bunch of these things and it’s always the syncing\nthat kills it.” They’re actively searching for solutions which are all missing a\nmust-have feature — this could be your major differentiator if it’s important enough\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 34\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nto the segment and difficult enough for your competitors to emulate.\nOr:\nThem: “We have a decent workaround, as you saw. But it takes nearly a\nweek at the end of each month to pull all the reports together in one\nplace. It’s a big pain and totally stalls our work.” They’ve cobbled together a\nhome-brew solution, know it’s costing them money, and are ideally suited to become\nan early customer.\nAt my first company Habit, we were adapting our product to sell to enterprise\ncompanies. MTV told me they needed analytics and reports for their\ncampaigns.\nI made a big mistake by accepting the feature request and face value and\nbeginning the next meeting with a demo of our shiny new analytics dashboard\n(custom-built to solve their request, of course). They “ooh’ed” and “ahh’ed”\nappropriately and I left thinking we’d nailed it. It offered a zillion options and\ncould carve up your data every which way. It was technically and aesthetically\nlovely.\nUnfortunately, 90% of what we had built was irrelevant. We just didn’t know\nthat yet.\nThey started calling every Friday asking me to email over a CSV (data file) of\nthe week’s stats, so we added CSV export to the dashboard. Later, they asked for\nthe report as a PDF instead of an CSV, so we obediently built PDF export. That\ntook longer.\nSalt was rubbed in the wound when, weeks later, they were still calling me every\nFriday and asking me to export and send over the same stupid analytics report.\nAnd every week, I would do so while politely explaining that, you know, we built\nthis awesome self-serve dashboard so they could have their data whenever they\nwanted. And then, the next Friday, they’d call me.\nIt turned out we had entirely missed the real reason they’d been excited about\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 35\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nour analytics demo. In fact, we'd missed their whole motivation for wanting\nanalytics.\nThe memory of being burned by feature requests was still fresh in my mind\nwhen they asked if we could add their logo and colours to the reports. I asked a\ncouple incredulous questions about why in the world they wanted this feature\nwhen they didn’t even use the ones I had already built, like an exasperated Dad\nat Christmas: “But you don’t even play with the toys I bought for your\nbirthday!”\nSo, I finally—and inadvertently—did the smart thing when I asked, “Why do\nyou want this feature? What do branded reports get you that unbranded ones\ndon’t? It’s the same data, right?” She replied, “Oh yeah, of course. I mean,\nnobody even reads these. Our clients just like to get something emailed to them\nat the end of every week and we think they’d be happier if it was a bit fancier,\nyou know?” I knew exactly.\nThey had asked for analytics. We had jumped to the conclusion that they\nwanted to better understand their data. But they had really wanted a way to\nkeep their own clients happy. If we had properly understood that, we would\nhave built a totally different (and much simpler) set of features.\nConsider how much easier our lives would have been if we’d understood the\nmotivation behind the request. Instead of enabling the exploration and export\nof all campaign data, we could have just always exported the few high-level\nnumbers a big brand manager would be interested in. And instead of a selfserve dashboard, we could set up a little scheduler to send it to them every\nFriday. In fact, we didn’t even need to build a dashboard at all. And instead of\ncoding up a layout and branding system for the reports, we could have had an\nintern hand-build them each week. All wasted because I didn’t ask the right\nquestion. I sure wish I had those 3 months back!\nWhen you hear a request, it’s your job to understand the motivations which led\nto it. You do that by digging around the question to find the root cause. Why do\nthey bother doing it this way? Why do they want the feature? How are they\ncurrently coping without the feature? Dig.\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 36\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nYou should dig in the same way around emotional signals to understand where\nthey’re coming from. Just like feature requests, any strong emotion is worth\nexploring. Is someone angry? Dig. Embarrassed? Dig. Overjoyed? Dig!\nI once overheard a founder interviewing someone at a cafe table next to me.\nThe founder mentioned a problem and the guy responded, “Yeah, that’s pretty\nmuch the worst part of my day.” The founder jotted something down in his\nnotebook, and then moved on to the next question. What!? It’s the worst part of his\nday and you’re not going to figure out why? That’s insane. You’ve got to dig.\nQuestions to dig into feature requests:\n• “Why do you want that?”\n• “What would that let you do?”\n• “How are you coping without it?”\n• “Do you think we should push back the launch add that feature, or is it\nsomething we could add later?”\n• How would that fit into your day?\nQuestions to dig into emotional signals:\n• “Tell me more about that.”\n• “That seems to really bug you — I bet there’s a story here.”\n• “What makes it so awful?”\n• “Why haven’t you been able to fix this already?”\n• “You seem pretty excited about that — it’s a big deal?”\n• “Why so happy?”\n• “Go on.”\nThese nudges don’t need to be complicated. People love talking about their\nopinions and emotions. Digging into a signal is basically just giving them\npermission to do a brain dump.\nRule of thumb: Ideas and feature requests should be understood, but not obeyed.\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 37\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nStop seeking approval\nAs we’ve seen, compliments are dangerous and sneaky. So if we can nip them in\nthe bud before they bloom, so much the better. The main source of\ncompliment-creation is seeking approval, either intentionally or inadvertently.\nDoing it intentionally is fishing for compliments. You aren’t looking for\ncontradictory information. You’ve already made up your mind, but need\nsomeone’s blessing take the leap.\nSymptoms of Fishing For Compliments:\n• “I’m thinking of starting a business... so, do you think it will work?”\n• “I had an awesome idea for an app — do you like it?”\nAccidental approval-seeking is what I call “The Pathos Problem.” It happens\nwhen you expose your ego, leading people to feel they ought to protect you by\nsaying nice things.\nThis comes up when you tell someone about an idea you obviously care about\n(which is pretty much always, since otherwise you wouldn’t be asking). Even if\nyou give folks permission to be honest and ask for criticism, they’re still going to\npull their punches.\nSymptoms of The Pathos Problem:\n• “So here’s that top-secret project I quit my job for... what do you think?”\n• “I can take it — be honest and tell me what you really think!”\nTo deal with The Pathos Problem, keep the conversation focused on the other\nperson and ask about specific, concrete cases and examples. Once someone\ndetects that your ego is on the line, they’ll give you fluffy mis-truths and extra\ncompliments. Disregard that data and use The Mom Test to re-focus on the\nperson, their life, and their goals. People rarely lie about specific stuff that’s\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 38\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nalready happened, regardless of your ego.\nSome famous entrepreneurs don’t suffer the effects of The Pathos Problem, but\nyou should ignore their advice since it’s not reproducible if you aren’t them.\nGuys like Elon Musk, Reid Hoffman, and Gordon Ramsey are all notorious for\nactively seeking negative feedback. It evidently works for them. But nobody is\nworried about hurting Elon, Reid, or Gordon’s feelings. You and I must be more\ncircumspect.\nIn short, remember that compliments are worthless and people’s approval\ndoesn’t make your business better. Keep your idea and your ego out of the\nconversation until you’re ready to ask for commitments.\nRule of thumb: If you’ve mentioned your idea, people will try to protect your\nfeelings.\nCut off pitches\nBeing pitchy is the dark side of the “seeking approval” coin. Instead of inviting\ncompliments by being vulnerable, you’re demanding them by being annoying.\nIt’s when you hold someone hostage and won’t let them leave until they’ve said\nthey like your idea. Normally, compliments are well-intentioned. In this case,\nthey’re just trying to get you out of their office.\n“Won’t-take-no-for-an-answer” is generally a good quality for a founder to have.\nBut when it creeps into a conversation that’s meant to be about learning, it\nworks against you.\nSymptoms:\n• “No no, I don’t think you get it...”\n• “Yes, but it also does this!”\nIf you slip into pitch mode, just apologise. You’re excited about your idea.\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 39\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nThat’s good! Otherwise you wouldn’t have taken this crazy leap in the first\nplace. But suddenly, you find yourself five minutes into an enthusiastic\nmonologue while the other person nods politely. That’s bad. Once you start\ntalking about your idea, they stop talking about their problems. Cut yourself off\nand say something like:\n“Whoops—I just slipped into pitch mode. I’m really sorry about that—I\nget excited about these things. Can we jump back to what you were just\nsaying? You were telling me that…\"\nIf they say they really want to hear about what you’re working on, promise that\nyou’ll tell them at the end of the meeting or loop them in for an early demo, and\nthat you just want to talk a bit more about their stuff before biasing them with\nyour idea.\nRule of thumb: Anyone will say your idea is great if you’re annoying enough\nabout it.\nTalk less\nYou can’t learn anything useful unless you’re willing to spend a few minutes\nshutting up (even if you have something really smart to say).\nAfter you introduce your idea (either intentionally or accidentally), they’re going\nto begin a sentence with something like “So it’s similar to…” or “I like it but…”\nIt’s tempting (and common) to interrupt and “fix” their understanding about\nhow it’s totally different than that competitor or it actually does do that thing\nthey want.\nAlternately, they’ll raise a topic you have a really good answer to. For example,\nthey’ll mention how important security is, and you’ll want to cut in and tell them\nhow you’ve thought about all that already. This is also a mistake.\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 40\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nIn both cases, the listener was about to give you a privileged glimpse into their\nmental model of the world. Losing that learning is a shame. You’ll have the\nchance to fill them in later. Plus, it’s annoying to people if they start trying to\nhelp you and you cut them off to correct them. Nobody likes a know-it-all!\nRule of thumb: The more you’re talking, the worse you’re doing.\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 41\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nCHAPTER THREE\nAsking important\nquestions\nOnce we know about The Mom Test and start trying to ask non-biasing\nquestions, sometimes we over-compensate and ask completely trivial ones.\nAsking someone how old they are isn’t biasing, but it also doesn’t move your\nbusiness forward. You have to apply The Mom Test to the questions which\nmatter. Otherwise you’re just spinning your wheels.\nIn addition to ensuring that you aren’t asking trivialities, you also need to look\nfor the world-rocking scary questions you’re shrinking from. The best way to\nfind them is to run thought experiments. Imagine that the company has failed\nand ask why that happened. Then imagine it as a huge success and ask what had\nto be true to get there. Find ways to learn about those critical pieces.\nYou can tell it’s an important question when the answer to it could completely\nchange (or disprove) your business. If you get an unexpected answer to a\nquestion and it doesn’t affect what you’re doing, it wasn’t a terribly important\nquestion.\nEvery time you talk to someone, you should be asking a question which has the\npotential to completely destroy your currently imagined business.\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 42\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nOne of my companies had some legal ambiguities around content ownership. It\nwas okay in theory, but lacked strong precedents. I was always a bit nervous we\nwould get “found out.” Their execs were excited, their creatives were thrilled.\nWe had even brought the stubborn tech team around to our side. But in all my\nearly customer conversations, I never asked to talk to their lawyers. For whatever\nreason, that was an important question which I shrunk from, and not asking it\ncost us at least half a million bucks.\nThere’s no easy solution to making yourself face and ask these questions. I once\nheard the general life advice that, for unpleasant tasks, you should imagine what\nyou would have someone else do if you were delegating it. Then do that.\nAnd remember, you’re allowed to ask about money. You're a startup. It's okay.\nRule of thumb: You should be terrified of at least one of the questions you’re\nasking in every conversation.\nLove bad news\nOne of the reasons we avoid important question is because asking them is scary.\nIt can bring us the upsetting realisation that our favourite idea is fundamentally\nflawed. Or that the major client is never going to buy. Although it seems\nunfortunate, this we need to learn to love bad news. It’s solid learning and is\ngetting us closer to the truth.\nIf you’ve only got one shot, then bad news is bad news. If your bungee jump\ndoesn’t work, that’s bad. If you’ve sunk your retirement savings into opening a\ncafe and it doesn’t work, that’s bad. If you hustle together $50k to start your\nbusiness and spend all $50k on your first idea only to see it fail, that’s bad.\nOn the other hand, if you have $50k and spend $5k to learn you’re running\ndown a dead end, that’s awesome. You can use the rest to find a viable path to\nyour goal.\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 43\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nSimilarly, if you have an exciting idea for a new product and go talk to a couple\ncustomers who don’t actually care about it, then that’s a great result. You just\nsaved yourself however much time and money it would have cost to try building\nand selling it.\nWe go through the futile process of asking for opinions and fish for compliments\nbecause we crave approval. We want to believe that the support and sign-off of\nsomeone we respect means our venture will succeed. But really, that person’s\nopinion doesn’t matter. They have no idea if the business is going to work. Only\nthe market knows.\nYou’re searching for the truth, not trying to be right. And you want to do it as\nquickly and cheaply as possible. Learning that your beliefs are wrong is\nfrustrating, but it’s progress. It’s bringing you ever closer to the truth of a real\nproblem and a good market.\nThe worst thing you can do is ignore the bad news while searching for some tiny\ngrain of validation to celebrate. You want the truth, not a gold star.\nSome of the most informative (and thus best) responses you can get are along\nthe lines of, “Umm, I’m not so sure about that” and \"That's pretty neat.\" Both\nare lukewarm responses which tell you they don’t care.\nIn this context, “best” means learning, not selling. If you’re a sales guy going\ndoor to door selling gadgets and someone doesn’t care, then that is a bad result:\nyou’re not getting paid. But if you’re trying to decide whether to invest your\ntime and money in developing, building and promoting that gadget, then\nlukewarm is a terrific response. It gives you a crystal clear signal that this person\ndoes not care. It’s perfectly reliable information you can take to the bank.\nThe classic error in response to a lukewarm signal is to “up your game” and\npitch them until they say something nice. Unless they’re holding a check, the\nonly thing to gain from “convincing” them are false positives. You’re not here to\ncollect compliments; you’re trying to learn the truth. Their lukewarm response\nalready gave you that.\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 44\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nIf they’re still engaged in the conversation, it’s worth asking a couple follow-up\nquestions to understand the nature of their apathy. Is the “problem” not actually\nthat big of a deal? Are they fundamentally different from your ideal customers?\nDo they not care about the specific implementation? Are they worn out and\nskeptical from hearing too many pitches, like cafe owners in the aftermath of\nGroupon? Are they just plain tired today?\nAfter that, say a big thanks and leave them to their day. They’ve probably helped\nyou more than the guy who said he loved it.\nRule of thumb: There’s more reliable information in a “meh” than a “Wow!” You\ncan’t build a business on a lukewarm response.\nLook before you zoom\nAnother way we miss the important questions is by instead spending our time on\nultimately unimportant details. This can happen when we get stuck in the details\nbefore understanding the big picture.\nMost people have lots of problems which they don’t actually care enough about\nto fix, but which they’ll happily tell you the details of if you ask them. Before\nyou have solid evidence that you’re fixing a meaningful problem for your\ncustomer segment, you can really mess yourself up by zooming in too quickly.\nA (really, really) bad conversation:\nYou: “Hello. Thanks for taking the time. We’re building phone and\ntablet apps to help people stay in shape and just wanted to understand\nhow you stay fit.” This isn’t a terrible opening, but I’d generally avoid\nmentioning the idea immediately since it gives them a good idea of which answers\nyou’re hoping to hear.\nThem: “Okay.” I never exercise, so this should be quick.\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 45\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nYou: “How often do you go to the gym?” This sort of demographic data\ndoesn’t give you any new insight, but can still be useful at the start of a conversation\nto figure out what sort of person you’re talking to so you can ask relevant follow-ups.\nThem: “Not really ever.” Well, looks like we’re done here then!\nYou: “What would you say your biggest problem with going to the gym\nis?” This is where the conversation goes horribly wrong. Instead of figuring out\nwhether staying fit is actually a real problem, we’re prematurely zooming in on it.\nAny response we get is going to be dangerously misleading.\nThem: “I guess the time it takes to get there. I’m always kind of busy,\nyou know?” Wait, who says I have a problem with going to the gym? I thought I\njust told you I don’t care about the gym! But if I had to choose one, I guess I’d go\nwith convenience. Not that I’ve done a pushup in 5 years. Pushups are pretty\nconvenient.\nYou: “Perfect. That’s great. And could you rank these 4 in terms of\nwhich is most important to you in a fitness program: convenience,\npersonalisation, novelty, or cost?” Note that we’re still assuming we’re talking\nto a person who actually cares about getting in shape. Questions like this don’t\nactually tell you if the person cares about any of it at all.\nThem: “Probably convenience, then cost, then personalisation, then\nnovelty.” Since you asked, I’ll answer. Hypothetically speaking, of course.\nYou: “Okay. Awesome. Thanks so much. We’re working on an app to\nhelp you exercise in the convenience of your own home. I think it’s\ngoing to be a great fit for what you care about.” Totally missing the point\nand mis-interpreting the conversation as validation. Now fishing for compliments.\nThem: “Cool. I’d love to try it when it launches.” Half-hearted compliment\nplus non-committal stalling tactic.\nYou: “Great — I’ll send over one of our beta keys so you can check it\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 46\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nout.” We got a user!\nThem: “Thanks.” I am literally never going to type that in.\nThe reason this conversation is so very bad is because, if you aren’t paying\nattention, it seems like it went well. If you focus the conversation too quickly on\none problem area, you can think you’ve validated a “top” problem when you\nhaven’t. You just led them there.\nIf you ask me what my biggest problem with staying fit is, I’ll probably tell you\nit’s the time cost of going to the gym. But then, if you build me a workout-athome app, I’m going to ignore it. Even though commute time is the biggest\nproblem with getting in shape, the whole area of fitness just isn’t something I\ncare about enough to act on. My #1 fitness problem is still an unimportant one.\nLet’s start the conversation in the same way and fix it when it starts to go off\ntrack:\nA good conversation\nYou: “How often do you go to the gym?”\nThem: “Um. Not really ever.” Looks like we’re done here.\nYou: “Why not?” Instead of taking for granted that staying fit is one of their top\npriorities, let’s dig into the motivations.\nThem: “I don’t know, it’s just not something I’m that worried about, you\nknow?” Not trying to fix this, so unlikely to buy or use an app.\nYou: “When’s the last time you did try? Have you ever joined a gym or\ntaken up jogging or anything?” Let’s anchor the generic just to make sure…\nThem: “Oh yeah, I used to be into sports in high school. It just hasn’t\nbeen a big deal since I settled down. Running around after the kids\ngives me all the cardio I need!”\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 47\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nYou: “Haha, gotcha. Thanks for the time!” This was a pleasant conversation\nand we learned what we came for, so we can abandon ship and leave him to his day.\nThe premature zoom is a real problem because it leads to data which seems like\nvalidation, but is actually worthless. In other words, it’s a big source of false\npositives.\nLet’s re-run the same conversation, but instead of immediately zooming in on\nexercise, we’ll start more generic, since we aren’t sure that fitness is a must-solve\nproblem:\nA good conversation:\nYou: “What are your big goals and focuses right now?” Products which\nsolve problems on this list are infinitely more likely to get bought. We might\nalternately ask for major annoyances, costs, or joys.\nThem: “The big one is finalising that promotion at work. And we just\nbought our first house, so I’ve got to get that all fixed up and ready to\ngo. Exciting times. And I want to find a bit more time for the missus,\nyou know? Things have been pretty busy lately.” Work, house, and\nmarriage. Not looking good for us!\nYou: “You’re buying a new house and expect to be less busy?”\nThem: “Can’t blame a guy for hoping.”\nYou: “Is getting healthier on that list?” We probably already know the answer,\nbut it doesn’t hurt to ask leading questions when you’re about to abort the\nconversation anyway. If they come back with a positive, just be a little extra careful\nin making sure they aren’t lying.\nThem: “I’m actually feeling pretty good at the moment.” Not a customer.\nHowever, we don’t always need to start the conversation from the square one of\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 48\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\ndo-they-care-at-all. Sometimes we know the problem exists as a top priority and we\ncan safely zoom in immediately.\nFor example, let’s say we help drive qualified leads to small business websites. We\nknow that marketing is always a top 3 problem for small businesses, so we can\nfocus on it and start the conversation by zooming in with a question like:\nYou: What are your big problems with marketing? We can immediately\nzoom in on the problem if we are 100% certain it’s a must-solve problem which\npeople are ready to pay for.\nVersus:\nYou: What are your big problems right now? If we aren’t sure it’s a mustsolve problem, we start more generic to see if they care at all about the problem\ncategory, in which case they’ll mention it.\nNow imagine you’ve built the aforementioned marketing tool for small\nbusinesses and realise it could also be used to help bloggers get more attention.\nYou’re wondering if you have another strong customer segment. However, since\nblogs have a harder time monetising traffic than small businesses, we can’t\nnecessarily assume that they’re also going to happily pay for traffic.\nFor example, I have a blog which I quite like (but which I don’t take seriously as\na business) at thestartuptoolkit.com. If you’re talking to me and you ask, “Hey\nRob, what are your top problems with marketing your blog?” Then you’ve just\nprematurely zoomed on a non-problem.\nI’m going to tell you some sort of answer which sounds legit but is actually\nmisleading. I might say that my keywords are all kind of generic, so it’s hard to\nattract the right people. Or that I walk a fine line between writing beginner and\nadvanced articles, so it’s tough to attract the right people. Whatever. Problems\nexist with my blog marketing, but the whole space just isn’t something I’m too\nfussed about. I write because it’s fun, not because it’s how I pay my rent.\nTo have a useful conversation, you need to zoom back out to ask about my blog\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 49\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nin general, rather than marketing my blog.\nA good conversation:\nYou: “Hey Rob, what are the top problems with your blog?”\nMe: “I’m pissed that Google Reader is disappearing — I feel that I’m\ngoing to lose like half my followers. And this book is consuming all of\nmy interest in writing, so I haven’t really posted in months. And\nWordpress seems so slow these days.” Of the topics here, one of them\n(Google Reader and audience size) is related to marketing, so you can anchor on that\nand figure out whether I’m a customer or just a complainer.\nYou: “That Google Reader thing is a mess. What are you doing about\nit?” Now that you’ve let me raise the topic, you know it’s on my mind and can more\nsafely zoom in to talk about that specifically. As before, try to figure out what I’m\nalready spending time and money on.\nMe: “Nothing, really. I don’t know what to do. But it sucks.” I’m not\nappearing terribly motivated, but the fact that I don’t know what to do could give\nyou hope.\nYou: “Have you looked into what your options are?” Continue anchoring\nand digging.\nMe: “No, I just caught the drama on Hacker News.” I knew the readerpocalypse was coming and didn’t even search around to properly understand the\nimplications and my options. This just isn’t a big deal for me, despite how\n“annoyed” I claim to be.\nYou: “Are you going to make a serious effort to build your audience\nback up?” You are digging into the audience size signal, since it’s relevant to your\nspace. It’s a fluff-inviting question (hypothetical future-tense), so you should be\nskeptical of the answer, but it’s hard to see a better way to get at the information you\nwant from here. Not every question can be perfect, sadly.\nMe: “Probably just keep on writing when I have something to say. It’s\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 50\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nmore of a hobby than a business, really.”\nAt this point, you might be suspicious about how much I actually care about my\nblog, despite going out of my way to mention it twice (hint hint:\nthestartuptoolkit.com). When it’s not clear whether a problem is a must-solveright-now (e.g. you’re selling a painkiller) or a nice-to-have (you’re selling a\nvitamin), you can get some clarity by asking cost/value questions like the\nfollowing.\n“Does-this-problem-matter” questions:\n• “How seriously do you take your blog?”\n• “Do you make money from it?”\n• “Have you tried making more money from it?”\n• “How much time do you spend on it each week?”\n• “Do you have any major aspirations for your blog?”\n• “Which tools and services do you use for it?”\n• “What are you already doing to improve this?”\n• “What are the 3 big things you’re trying to fix or improve right now?”\nSome of these questions are generic, but give us signals that we can anchor on\nand dig around. The bulk of them are about finding out whether the person\nwe’re talking to is taking this space seriously. Are they spending money or\nmaking money? Is it in their top 3? Are they actively looking for solutions?\nWhen you fall into a premature zoom, you can waste a ton of time figuring out\nthe minutia of a trivial problem. Even if you learn everything there is to know\nabout that particular problem, you still haven’t got a business.\nRule of thumb: Start broad and don't zoom in until you’ve found a strong signal,\nboth with your whole business and with every conversation.\nGaze upon the elephant\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 51\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nLastly, sometimes we comfort ourselves by asking questions which don’t actually\nde-risk the business or resolve those critical, big, scary, lurking questions. We\nignore the elephant in the room.\nLet’s say we suspect that teachers from the poorest schools are completely\noverloaded, and that our tools would save them time so they could better\neducate their students. We go talk to them and confirm that yes, they are\ncompletely overloaded. We then spend weeks with them, figuring out exactly\nwhat their dream tool would do. Unfortunately, we've missed the elephant,\nwhich is that the poorest schools may not have the budgets available to pay us\nwhat we need. We're liable to spend a huge amount of time exploring a real and\nurgent problem, only to hop into the deadpool due to our customer's budgeting\nissues.\nSuccessful startups tend to depend on multiple failure points. In this case it is\nboth the needs of the teachers and the ability of the schools to pay us. If any of\nthese conditions doesn't exist, we have to significantly overhaul our idea. It's\ntempting to obsess over the most interesting of several failure points and ignore\nthe others. It's a great way to miss important questions.\nBeyond the risks of our customers and market, we also have challenges with our\nown product. Overlooking the product risks is just as deadly as overlooking the\ngoals and constraints of our customers. Take the following conversation with a\nprofessional public speaker. Is it full of good data or bad data?\nAn ambiguous conversation:\nThem: “…I get paid 2 or 3 grand per talk. Sometimes more if it’s\ncorporate work.” Some good pricing and value signals.\nYou: “Where do you get your gigs? Do you have an agent?” Trying to\nunderstand the alternatives.\nThem: “Yeah. He kind of sucks though. Most of my work comes\nthrough people who just know me from my blog or have seen my other\ntalks.” Hardly a must-solve problem since he has a reliable workaround, but at\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 52\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nleast it’s high value.\nYou: “What’s wrong with the agent? And why do you still work with\nhim?” Dig.\nThem: “I’m one of the lowest-paid people they work with, so I get\nignored a lot. But sometimes he brings in deals, so whatever. It’s free\nmoney.” Good information on his motivations and goals.\nAt this point, let’s say I’m confident that getting gigs is important to him. I also\nknow what it’s worth and how he’s currently accomplishing it. So I zoom in to\nintroduce the problem I’m solving and the way I want to approach it.\nYou: “I’m building a marketplace to cut out the agents and connect\nevent organisers directly with speakers. It should help you get more\ngigs and keep the agent fees. How would that fit into your speaking\nlife?”\nThem: “Man, that’s awesome. If you could get me more more gigs —\nor better paid ones — I’d happily drop my agent and pay you 20% of\nthe boost. I know a bunch of other people who would love to as well.”\nThis is the important bit — is it good?\nSo what’s the result? Beyond being excited, we got some concrete data about\nhow valuable this could be to him. Plus, it involved a commitment to be one of\nour early users. It sure seems good.\nBut what did he actually tell us? He said that if we can get him more gigs, then\nhe’ll pay a cut. Well, obviously. Who doesn’t want free money? His needs are\nclear: he wants to make more money by speaking. If we can send him work, he’ll\nshare some of it with us. This was never really in doubt.\nThe key phrase of “if you could get me more gigs” is basically shifting the\nburden from the customer to your product. Even though you’ve found a pain,\nyour success is dependent on a bunch of other factors, such as your ability to\ngrow a healthy supply of paying gigs which are a good fit for him. Will you be\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 53\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nable to do that? It remains to be seen.\nThis situation is easier to spot in the online advertising industry. Imagine\nrunning customer conversations with an advertiser to try to understand their\npains so you can convince them to advertise on your site. They’d sort of look at\nyou blankly and say, “Listen, if you can get enough page views, we’ll pay you for\nthem.” In fact, it’s such a well established would-pay-to-solve-problem that you\ndon’t even need to talk to them to set it up. You just plug in an ad network and\nyou’re done.\nSimilarly with affiliate commissions. If you sell a company’s products, you get a\ncut. That’s just how it works. You don’t need to explore or validate or\nunderstand their problems. The risk resides in your ability to get lots of traffic\nand sell lots of products. If you can, they’ll pay you.\nIn all of these examples, the risk is in your product, not in the market or the\ncustomer. The customer will pay if your product gets big enough.\n• Product risk — Can I build it? Can I grow it? Will they keep using it?\n• Market risk — Do they want it? Will they pay? Are there enough of\nthem?\nYou don’t want to overlook one or the other. I met a founder who had wasted 3\nmonths on worthless customer conversations. He wanted to start a company\nbuilding gadgets to track the fertility of farm animals, ultimately boosting\nbirthrates and thus revenue. When he talked to farmers, he asked questions like,\n“Would you switch trackers if something cheaper and more effective was\navailable?” That’s the same as asking someone whether they would like more\nmoney. The answer is always “Yes.” The farmers responded along the lines of,\n“If you can build what you say you can build, I’ll equip my whole herd.” The\nproblem is, he couldn’t build it. The risk was in the product.\nI’ve also seen this strike several of the recent companies who want to use\nmobile/realtime deals to drive foot traffic to bars and clubs. They run customer\nconversations with bar owners who confirm that: yes, they would like more\ncustomers on the slow nights; and yes, they would pay you if you could send\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 54\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\ncustomers on demand. The founders take this as strong validation (“They have\nthe problem and committed to pay!”) without recognising that the vast majority\nof the risk is in the product, not the market. Bars will pay, but only if you can\namass a huge audience of consumers. Then the founders talk to consumers and\nask if they would use an app which always pointed them to booming parties\nwith cheap booze. Again, obviously yes. But that doesn’t tell us whether we can\nactually get to that critical mass of users.\nVideo games are pure product risk. What sort of question could you ask to\nvalidate your game idea? “Do you like having fun?” “Would you like to have even\nmore fun?” Practically 100% of the risk is in the product and almost none is in\nthe customer. You know people buy games. If yours is good and you can find a\nway to make them notice it, they’ll buy it. You don’t need to rediscover people’s\ndesire to play video games.\nThis isn’t to say that you shouldn’t talk to anyone if you’re building something\nwith product risk. In the case of the farm fertility monitor, it’s good to know that\nthe farmer isn’t opposed to switching tech once he’s already got something\ninstalled, for example. For the nightclubs, it’s good to know that they’re at least\ntheoretically willing to pay for promotion. It would be tragic to succeed at the\nhard work of creating the technology or community only to learn nobody will\npay for it.\nWhat all this does mean is that if you’ve got heavy product risk (as opposed to\npure market risk), then you’re not going to be able to prove as much of your\nbusiness through conversations alone. The conversations give you a starting\npoint, but you’ll have to start building product earlier and with less certainty\nthan if you had pure market risk.\nPrepare your list of 3\nAlways pre-plan the 3 most important things you want to learn from any given\ntype of person.\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 55\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nPre-planning your big questions makes it a lot easier to ask questions which pass\nThe Mom Test and aren’t biasing. It also makes it easier to face the questions\nthat hurt. If we go through an unplanned conversation, we tend to focus on\ntrivial stuff which keeps the conversation comfortable. Instead, decide what to\nask with your team in a calm environment.\nYour 3 questions will be different for each type of person you’re talking to. If\nyou have multiple types of customers or partners, you’ll want a list of 3 for each.\nDon’t stress too much about choosing the “right” important questions. They will\nchange. Just choose the 3 questions which seem murkiest or most important right\nnow. Doing so will give you firmer footing and a better sense of direction for\nyour next 3.\nYou might get answers 1-3 from customer A, answer 4 from customer B,\nanswers 5-7 from customer C. There’s overlap and repetition, but you don’t\nneed to repeat the full set of questions with every participant. Don’t feel obliged\nto repeat questions you already have reliable data on. Pick up where you left off\nand keep filling in the picture.\nKnowing your list allows you to take better advantage of serendipitous\nencounters. Instead of running into that dream customer and asking to\nexchange business cards so you can “grab a coffee” (exactly like everyone else),\nyou can just pop off your most important question. And that goes a long way\ntoward Keeping it Casual.\nRule of thumb: You always need a list of your 3 big questions.\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 56\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nCHAPTER FOUR\nKeeping it casual\nWe know that zooming prematurely and introducing your idea too early creates\nbiases and can get you stuck on a local maximum. In his original book on\nCustomer Development, 4 Steps to the E.piphany, Steve Blank solves this by\nrecommending 3 separate meetings: the first about the customer and their\nproblem; the second about your solution; and the third to sell a product. By\nsplitting the meetings, you avoid the premature zoom and biasing them with\nyour ideas.\nIn practice, however, I’ve found it both difficult and inefficient to set them up.\nThe time cost of a 1-hour meeting is more like 4 hours once you factor in the\ncalendar dance, commuting, and reviewing. It’s also a big time commitment to\nask from the customer before you’re in a position to show them anything in\nreturn.\nIn the early days, asking for the first conversation was simply impossible for me.\nI wasn’t credible enough, so nobody wanted to take a meeting just to talk to me\nabout their day. Steve recommends starting with friendly first contacts.\nDefinitely do that if you have them. Thanks to The Mom Test, the fact that\nthey’re friends won’t bias your data, so long as you ask good questions. In my\ncase though, I was entering a new industry with high walls (brand advertising)\nand no friendly first contacts.\nAs my credibility built after a couple years in the industry, I found I was now\nable to get meetings without any real “reason”. The 3-meeting structure was\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 57\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nfinally viable! But once I started doing it, it felt like a bad use of my time. The\nmost precious resource a startup has is its founders’ time and attention. You\nhave to put yourself where you matter most, and I wasn’t finding early customer\nmeetings to be that place. I wished I could get the learning without all the\noverhead.\nIf the solution isn’t a 3-meeting series, then what is it? You may have noticed a\ntrend throughout the conversation examples we’ve seen so far: keeping it casual.\nLet’s say I’m trying to build tools to help public speakers get more speaking gigs\nand I bump into one at a conference. I’m not going to try to set up a meeting.\nInstead, I’m just going to immediately transition into my most important\nquestion: “Hey, I’m curious—how did you end up getting this gig?” As a side\nbonus, we’re also now having an interesting conversation and I’m far more likely\nto be remembered and get a meeting later.\nWhen you strip all the formality from the process, you end up with no meetings,\nno interview questions, and a much easier time. The conversations become so\nfast and lightweight that you can go to a industry meet-up and leave with a\ndozen customer conversations under your belt, each of which provided as much\nvalue as a formal meeting.\nThe structure of separate problem/solution/sales conversations is critical for\navoiding bias, but it’s important to realise that the first one doesn’t actually need\nto be a meeting.\nRule of thumb: Learning about a customer and their problems works better as a\nquick and casual chat than a long, formal meeting.\nThe meeting anti-pattern\nThe Meeting Anti-Pattern is the tendency to relegate every opportunity for\ncustomer conversation into a calendar block.\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 58\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nBeyond being a bad use of your time and setting expectations that you’re going\nto show them a product, over-reliance on formal meetings can cause us to\noverlook perfectly good chances for serendipitous learning.\nImagine that you’re in a crowded cafe, tapping away at your keyboard, when\nyour dream boy/girl sits down next to you. They’re wearing a charming hat and\ngive you a friendly nod before cracking open a dog-eared old novel which just\ntotally completes the mood. You slam down a quick espresso to psych yourself\nup and fumble through some sort of awkward monologue about how they seem\nlike a really nice person and this is kind of weird because you don’t even know\neach other but maybe they want to go get a coffee sometime? Like, a different\ncoffee? At a different place?\nWe know this is a silly situation. After all, the purpose of a date is to talk to each\nother and see if you get along. Therefore, for all intents and purposes, you were\nalready on a date. And then you messed it up by trying to over-formalise it when\nyou could have just chatted a bit and skipped that whole first date completely.\nWe’re going to pull exactly the same trick on our early customer conversations.\nWe’re going to strip the pomp and circumstance and reduce it from a meeting to\na chat. If we do it right, they won’t even know we were talking about our idea.\nI was considering a product idea to make office managers more efficient. I\nplayed with the possibilities on Friday, figured out the big questions over the\nweekend, and then went to an industry event on Monday. A handful of office\nmanagers were there and without any of them realising we’d “had a meeting”,\nI'd learned that the big problem was really about debt collection rather than\nefficiency. I got there by just being interested and chatting with them over a\nbeer: “X seems really annoying, how do you deal with it?” “Is Y as bad as it\nseems?” “You guys did a great job with Z… Where did you get that from?”\nBeing too formal is a crutch we use to deal with an admittedly ambiguous and\nawkward situation. Instead of leaving wiggle room for the unexpected,\neverything becomes a process.\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 59\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nSymptoms of formality:\n• “So, first off, thanks for agreeing to this interview. I just have a few\nquestions for you and then I’ll let you get back to your day…”\n• “On a scale of 1 to 5, how much would you say you…”\nLearning from customers doesn’t mean you have to be wearing a suit and\ndrinking boardroom coffee. Asking the right questions is fast and touches on\ntopics people find quite interesting. You can talk anywhere and save yourself the\nformal meetings until you have something concrete to show.\nAt their best, these conversations are a pleasure for both parties. You’re probably\nthe first person in a long time to be truly interested in the petty annoyances of\ntheir day.\nRule of thumb: If it feels like they’re doing you a favour by talking to you, it’s\nprobably too formal.\nHow long are meetings?\nEarly conversations are very fast. The chats grow longer as you move from the\nearly broad questions (“Is this a real problem?”) toward more specific product\nand industry issues (“Which other software do we have to integrate with to close\nthe sale?”).\nIt only takes 5 minutes to learn whether a problem exists and is important.\nLearning how someone currently achieves a certain goal or solves a problem is\nalso quick.\nSoon you’ll find yourself asking questions which are answered with long stories\nexplaining their workflow, how they spend their time, or what else they’ve tried.\nYou can usually get what you came for in 10-15 minutes, but people love telling\nstories about themselves, so you can keep this conversation going indefinitely if\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 60\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nit’s valuable for you and interesting for them.\nAt the longer extreme, learning the details of an industry takes an hour or more.\nThankfully, those are easier conversations to manage since the other person\n(usually some sort of industry expert) can go into a monologue once you point\nthem in the right direction.\nThe duration of formal B2B meetings (the kind you schedule) is determined\nmore by the arbitrary calendar block than by what you actually want to learn.\nOf course, you've liable to burn 15 minutes just to get a cup of tea and say\nhello.\nOnce you have a product and the meetings take on a more sales-oriented feel,\nyou’ll want to start carving out clear blocks of 30+ minutes. You might lose 5\nminutes due to miscellaneous tardiness, spend 5 minutes saying hello, 5 minutes\nasking questions to understand their goals/problems/budget, 10 minutes to\nshow/describe the product, and the last 5 minutes figuring out next steps and\nadvancement. That's your half hour.\nThe potential speed of the early conversations one of the big reasons I like\nkeeping it casual and skipping the meeting. Scheduling and going to a meeting\nhas a lot of overhead for a 10 minute chat. Even explaining that you’re starting\na company and would love to ask a couple questions can take 5 or 10 minutes.\nYou'll make progress a lot faster if you’re able to leave your idea out of it for as\nlong as possible.\nPutting it together\nEven within a more formal meeting, you still might want to keep it casual if\nyou’re hoping to get non-biased feedback.\nI once had a product idea to help busy investors to manage their dealflow. I\nknew they got hundreds of applications per month and figured it must be a\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 61\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nspreadsheet nightmare. I lined up a couple meetings to ask about the industry. I\nshowed up to the first meeting and, while making smalltalk, said something like\n“I was thinking, you guys must get a ton of leads, right?” The guy laughed and\nsaid, yeah, it was crazy. “How in the world do you deal with all of that?” He sort\nof shrugged and pointed at a cluster of about a dozen sticky notes on the wall.\nEach held a name and a phone number. “Our analysts kill most of them before\nthey ever reach us, and then we throw out a bunch more. We only end up with\nabout 10 apiece that are serious contenders. We just call every couple weeks to\nsee how it’s going.” Well that doesn’t sound so bad, I said. “Yeah, it works pretty\nwell,” he replied. “Anyway, what did you want to talk about?”\nThey don’t have the problem. That’s successful learning. We disproved our idea\nbefore the guy even realised we were talking about it. It took 5 minutes, avoided\nbiases, and didn’t feed us any bad data in the form of compliments, fluff, or\nideas. Instead, we got concrete facts about our customers which are directly\nrelevant to our core business questions.\nOf course, it took me a 2-hour commute to get to those 5 minutes. It can’t be\nperfect every time.\nIn the aforementioned case, we proved ourselves wrong. Sometimes, however, it\ngoes in the opposite direction and everything we learn from customers makes us\neven more excited. In that case, we stand atop all that we’ve learned and take\nthe visionary leap of coming up with a specific product and business to make\nour customers’ lives better. And then we ask them to commit to it.\nRule of thumb: Give as little information as possible about your idea while still\nnudging the discussion in a useful direction.\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 62\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nCHAPTER FIVE\nCommitment\nand\nadvancement\nOnce we've learned the key facts about our industry and customers, it’s time to\nzoom in again and start revealing our idea and showing some product. The bad\nnews is that this invites nefarious compliments. The good news is that since we\nhave the beginnings of a product, we're now in a position to cut through the\nfalse positives by asking for commitments.\nIn sales, moving a sales relationship to the next stage is called \"advancement\".\nIt's like pushing a customer into the next step of your real-world acquisition\nfunnel. They'll either move forward or make it clear that they're not a customer.\nBoth are good results for your learning.\nWhen you fail to push for advancement, you end up with zombie leads:\npotential customers (or investors) who keep taking meetings with you and saying\nnice things, but who never seem to cut a check. It's like your startup has been\nfriend-zoned. Thankfully, you caused it, and that means you can fix it. It's a\nconsequence of being clingy and fearing rejection. By giving them a clear\nchance to either commit or reject us, we get out of the friend-zone and can\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 63\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nidentify the real leads.\nAs always, you’re not trying to convince every person to like what you’re doing.\nWhen you’ve got the information you came for (even if it’s that they don’t care),\nyou can leave. But at some point, you do need to put them to a decision in order\nto get it.\nSymptoms:\n• A pipeline of zombie leads\n• Ending product meetings with a compliment\n• Ending product meetings with no clear next steps\n• Meetings which \"went well\"\n• They haven't given up anything of value\nAs I use them in a customer learning context, commitment and advancement\nare separate concepts which overlap quite a lot and tend to appear together.\n• Commitment — They are showing they’re serious by giving up something\nthey value such as time, reputation, or money.\n• Advancement — They are moving to the next step of your real-world\nfunnel and getting closer to a sale.\nCommitment and advancement often arrive hand-in-hand. For example, to\nmove to the next step (advancement), you might need an introduction to your\ncontact’s boss (reputation commitment). As such, they are functionally\nequivalent for our purposes and I’m going to blur them into one concept for the\nfollowing sections.\nRule of thumb: “Customers” who keep being friendly but aren’t ever going to buy\nare a particularly dangerous source of mixed signals.\nMeetings succeed or fail\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 64\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nIt took me years to learn that there’s no such thing as a meeting which just\n\"went well\". Every meeting either succeeds or fails. You've lost the meeting when\nyou leave with a compliment or a stalling tactic. While we might spot something\nas blatant as \"Let's talk again after the holidays... Don't call me, I'll call you,\" we\naccept the more subtle versions every day.\nA meeting has succeeded when it ends with a commitment to advance to the\nnext step. But you have to force this resolution or the meetings drift along in lala-land while performing their ancient duty: wasting everyone’s time.\nIf you leave with worthless wishy washiness, I'd bet you're falling for one or both\nof the following traps:\n1. You're asking for their opinion about your idea (e.g. fishing for\ncompliments)\n2. You're not asking for a clear commitment or next steps\nYou know how to deal with compliments by now: deflect, ignore, and get back to\nbusiness. Commitments are similarly easy to master, once we know what we’re\nlooking for. When we leave without a commitment, sometimes it’s because we\nasked and got rejected. That’s sad, but it happens. Not everyone is going to\nconvert and at least you now know where you stand. You have a strong negative\ndata point.\nThe real failure is listed above as #2: not even asking. I never consider rejection\nto be a real failure. But not asking certainly is. This can happen because you\navoid the scary question or because you haven’t figured out what the next steps\nshould be.\nCommitment is important. It tells us whether people are actually telling the\ntruth. The more they give us, the more we can trust what they say.\nRule of thumb: If you don’t know what happens next after a product or sales\nmeeting, the meeting was pointless.\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 65\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nThe currencies of\nconversation\nCommitment can be cash, but doesn’t have to be. Think of it in terms of\ncurrency—what are they giving up for you? A compliment costs them nothing,\nso it’s worth nothing and carries no data. The major currencies are time,\nreputation risk, and cash.\nA time commitment could include:\n• Clear next meeting with known goals\n• Sitting down to give feedback on wireframes\n• Using a trial themselves for a non-trivial period\nReputation risk commitments might be:\n• Intro to peers or team\n• Intro to a decision maker (boss, spouse, lawyer)\n• Giving a public testimonial or case study\nFinancial commitments are easier to imagine and include:\n• Letter of intent (non-legal but gentlemanly agreement to purchase)\n• Pre-order\n• Deposit\nSometimes, strong commitments combine multiple currencies, such as someone\nagreeing to run a paid trial with their whole team, thus risking their time,\nmoney, and reputation.\nJust like compliments aren’t data when you’re trying to learn about a problem,\nthey also aren’t progress when you’re trying to validate a product. Hearing a\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 66\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\ncompliment can still be useful though—it’s a warning flag that the person you’re\ntalking to is trying to get rid of you.\nRule of thumb: The more they’re giving up, the more seriously you can take their\nkind words.\nGood meeting / bad\nmeeting\nGame time again. We just had a meeting. But how did it go? Were they good\nmeetings or bad meetings? Why? And if they’re bad, what can we do to fix\nthem?\nHave a think about the meetings listed below and then turn the page for further\ndiscussion.\n“That’s so cool. I love it!”\n“Looks great. Let me know when it launches.”\n“There are a couple people I can intro you to when you’re ready.”\n“What are the next steps?”\n“I would definitely buy that.”\n“When can we start the trial?”\n“Can I buy the prototype?”\n“When can you come back to talk to the rest of the team?”\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 67\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\n\"That's so cool. I love it!\"\nBad meeting. Pure, unadulterated compliment. This may make you feel good,\nbut there is precisely zero data here. But at least you won’t hurt yourself on this\none since it’s so obviously fluff.\nTo fix it, deflect the compliment and get back to business.\n\"Looks great. Let me know when it launches.\"\nBad meeting. A compliment plus a stalling tactic is the classic way to end a\npitch for something you’re never going to buy. This comes in a lot of flavours,\nbut they’re all basically a polite way to say, “Don’t call me, I’ll call you.”\nThe big error you can make here is to mistake this compliment-stall for a preorder (“He said he’ll buy it when it launches!”).\nTo fix it, I’d look for a commitment I could ask for today. If I was very early\nstage, I might ask for an introduction to his boss or tech team or the budgetholder so I can make sure I fully understand their needs. If I was slightly further\nthrough development, I might push him to agree to be one of our alpha users\nand to roll it out to some subset of their team and be a case study for launch. If\nI’ve hit on a real problem, he’ll jump at the chance to start making progress\ntoday and get early access.\n\"There are a couple people I can introduce you to when\nyou're ready.\"\nBad meeting. There’s some data here, but probably not as much as you\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 68\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\ninitially hope. On the bright side, at least you know he doesn’t think you’re\ncompletely nuts or he wouldn’t have even made the fluffy offer (unless he’s just\nname dropping). The problem is that the promise is so generic that it’s a\nworthless signal.\nTo fix it, try to convert fuzzy promises into something more concrete. The more\nspecific it is, the more seriously you can take it. For example: who does he want\nto introduce you to and what does “ready” mean? And why can’t he make the\nintro now? This isn’t about being pushy. You don’t have manifest destiny over his\nrolodex. But you do need to distinguish between legitimate offers and polite\ngesturing. Knowing what “ready” means can also give you a better sense of\nwhat your short-term goals should be.\n\"What are the next steps?\"\nGood meeting. A classic good meeting conclusion. To succeed, a meeting\ndoesn’t need to end with a check in your pocket. It just needs to advance to the\nnext step, whatever that is.\nIt's worth noting that you need to know your next steps to benefit from this. If\nyou have to say, “Let me have a think about that and get back to you,” then\nyou’ve ruined a perfectly good meeting.\nOf course, even clear next steps can be a lie. Everything can be a lie. But with\nnext steps in your pocket, you've got a fighting chance.\n\"I would definitely buy that.\"\nBad meeting. Danger! There’s admittedly some signal here, but the false\npositive danger is off the charts. This is the mis-interpreted answer which sunk\nthe first startup I worked at to the tune of ten million bucks.\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 69\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nTo fix it, you need to shift from fuzzy future promises into concrete current\ncommitments. For example, you could ask for a letter of intent, a pre-purchase\nor deposit, or intros to other decision makers and team members. Kickstarter is\nso wonderful because it forces customers who say they would buy it to actually\npull out a credit card and commit.\n\"When can we start the trial?\"\nMaybe a good meeting. Unlike “when does it launch,\" which is usually a\nstall, “When can we start” is a step forward. Setting up new software and\ntraining staff to use it is a big deal for most businesses. Even a \"free\" trial can\ncost them serious money. However, in some cases, \"trying\" software costs\nnothing, especially for individuals. For example, I've “tried” countless CRM\n(contact management) apps. It takes ten seconds to log in, look around, and\nnever think about it again.\nAs always, think in terms of currency. What are they giving up to try it out? If\nyour trial is too \"cheap\" to try, you can try to increase the cost of it. For\nexample, you could ask to write a case study about them after they've spent 2\nweeks using it. Or you could get them to promise to try using it with their team\nfor at least a week. If you've got a more developed product, you can take their\ncredit card and just charge them nothing if they cancel within 30 days. The\nmore they are giving up for you, the more seriously you can take their\nvalidation.\n\"Can I buy the prototype?\"\nGreat meeting. The best meeting conclusion I've seen is the rarely-heard but\nalways appreciated, “Can I buy the prototype?”\nA product designer was once showing me a brilliant smartphone tripod he was\ndesigning. He demo’d the 3D-printed prototype unit for me and I immediately\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 70\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nasked him how much it would cost to buy the prototype. He laughed and said\nhe’d gone through about a dozen prototypes already because people kept buying\nthem. That’s a good sign.\n\"When can you come back to talk to the rest of the\nteam?\"\nGood meeting. Bingo! If you are selling anything to companies, you’re going\nto have to talk to multiple people. If they won’t introduce you, then it’s a sure\nbet you’re at a dead end.\nEnterprise sales is tedious, but one of the perks is that you can get really\naccurate signals like this one quite early in the process. Building consumer\nproducts is a lot murkier since the customer conversation process doesn’t mimic\nthe purchase process.\nHow to fix a bad meeting\nThe worst meetings are the wishy-washy ones that you leave with neither\nrejection nor advancement. You are in no-man’s-land and you won’t learn\nanything until you fix the meeting by forcing a next step (or rejection).\nA lost meeting can often be saved by just pushing for a commitment at the end\nwhile you're being brushed off with a compliment.\nBut don't be annoying. You aren't trying to strong-arm folks into handing over\ntheir wallet. You are trying to cut through some of the polite rejections and find\nout if they're actually going to become a partner/investor/customer.\nIf they aren't excited, then good news: you got the information you came for.\nAssimilate it, decide if it matters enough to change your strategy, and then keep\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 71\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\non keeping on. The goal is just to put them to a decision so you can learn\nwhether you've found a must-have product and a real customer.\nRule of thumb: It’s not a real lead until you’ve given them a concrete chance to\nreject you.\nDon't pitch blind\nEven once you've moved on to more product-focused sales meetings, you still\nwant to start with some open-ended learning to get your bearings. You may\nknow what the market cares about, but figuring out what’s unique about this\nparticular person feels. It will make the rest of the conversation much smoother,\nincreases your chances of closing the deal, and also gives you ongoing learning\neven after you've got a product.\nStartup sales meetings too often go like this:\nYou: \"We do X. Want to buy it?\"\nThem: \"No thanks.\"\nThose rejections aren't helpful. Hard pitching gives binary feedback: you either\nnailed it or you didn't. That's okay when you're making fine adjustments (tweak\nthis feature) but bad for bigger questions (does anybody care at all about what\nI'm doing).\nAsk learning questions which pass The Mom Test. Then confirm by selling it.\nThis happens over both the life of your company and during a single meeting.\nCrazy customers and your\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 72\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nfirst sale\nIt’s pretty weird that anybody buys anything from young startups. In all\nlikelihood, before the year is up, you’re going to either go out of business,\nabandon the product, or sell the company. And even if you stay the course,\nthere’s no guarantee you can actually do what you say you can do.\nFirst customers are crazy. Crazy in a good way. They really, really want what\nyou’re making. They want it so badly that they’re willing to be the crazy person\nwho tries it first.\nKeep an eye out for the people who get emotional about what you’re doing.\nThere is a significant difference between: “Yeah, that’s a problem” and “THAT\nIS THE WORST PART OF MY LIFE AND I WILL PAY YOU RIGHT\nNOW TO FIX IT.”\nSteve Blank calls them earlyvangelists (early evangelists). In the enterprise\nsoftware world, they are the people who:\n• Have the problem\n• Know they have the problem\n• Have the budget to solve the problem\n• Have already cobbled together their own makeshift solution\nThey’re the company who will commit way before it makes rational sense to do\nso. It’s the guy who will give you cash right now from his discretionary budget to\nrun a trial. Or who will fight for you against his boss and lawyers when they’re\nsaying the tech is unproven.\nIn the consumer space, it’s the fan who wants your product to succeed so badly\nthat they’ll front you the money as a pre-order when all you’ve got is a duct-tape\nprototype. They're the one who will tell all their friends to chip in as well.\nThey’re the person reading your blog and searching for workarounds.\nWe’ve got 2 takeaways.\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 73\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nFirstly, when someone isn’t that emotional about what you’re doing, it’s pretty\nunlikely that they’re going to end up being one of the people who is crazy\nenough to be your first customer. Keep them on the list, but don’t count on\nthem to write the first check.\nSecondly, whenever you see the deep emotion, do your utmost to keep that\nperson close. They are the rare, precious fan who will get you through the hard\ntimes and turn into your first sale.\nIn summary, after you've learned the facts of your industry and customers and\ndesigned the solution, you start pushing for advancement and commitments to\nseparate dead leads from real customers.\nRule of thumb: In early stage sales, the real goal is learning. Revenue is just a sideeffect.\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 74\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nCHAPTER SIX\nFinding\nconversations\nNow that you know how to ask good questions and fix bad meetings, you know\nenough to have good customer conversations. Take this opportunity to go flex\nyour conversational muscles and talk to some people.\nIf you’re scratching your own itch with this business, you likely already know\nyour customers. Great! Go talk to them. Now that you’re armed with The Mom\nTest, they won’t be able to lie to you even though they know you.\nBut if you don’t already know folks, where do these conversations and meetings\ncome from?\nGoing to them\nDrumming up good conversations from cold leads is hard. It’s doable and\nsometimes you have no choice, but it’s far from ideal.\nThe goal of cold conversations is to stop having them. You hustle together the\nfirst one or two from wherever you can, and then, if you treat people’s time\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 75\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nrespectfully and are genuinely trying to solve their problem, those cold\nconversations start turning into warm intros. The snowball is rolling.\nCold calls\nWhat does it mean if you reach out to 100 people and 98 of them hang up on\nyou? Well, nothing, except that people don't like getting cold calls. No surprise\nthere. More importantly, it means you’ve now got 2 conversations in play. Unless\nyour plan is to sell your app via cold calls, the rejection rate is irrelevant.\nI know one team who successfully used cold LinkedIn messages to reach C-level\nexecs of several major UK retailers. They were ignored by practically every exec\nin the country, but you only need one to say “yes” to start the intro train.\nBeyond hard hustle, you should also stay open to serendipity. There are lots of\nways you can get lucky when you’re in the mood for it.\nSeizing serendipity\nI was mulling over the idea of building tools for for professional speakers and\nfound myself at a friend-of-a-friend’s engagement party. I heard someone across\nthe room say “my talk in Tokyo next week” and made a beeline over to her. She\nleft the party thinking I was a nice guy who was super interested in her career\nand I left with a bunch of useful customer insight and a commitment to use the\nprototype at her next talk.\nIf it sounds weird to unexpectedly interview people, then that's only the case\nbecause you're thinking of it as an interview instead of a conversation. The only\nthing people love talking about more than themselves is their problems. By\ntaking an interest in the problems and minutia of their day, you’re already being\nmore interesting than 99% of the people they’ve ever met.\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 76\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nRule of thumb: If it’s not a formal meeting, you don’t need to make excuses about\nwhy you’re there or even mention that you’re starting a business. Just have a\ngood conversation.\nFind a good excuse\nI was chatting to an aspiring entrepreneur in a cafe. Among other things, his\nproduct helped cafe owners educate potential customers on the origins and\nbackstory of their beans. He had been hitting the pavement for the past 2 weeks\nand getting turned away from cafe after cafe. He wanted to talk to me about his\ncustomer interview process. Ten minutes into the conversation, I cut in: “Who\nhave you talked to so far?” “Nobody—I don’t know the owners and the staff\nwon’t help me.” “Have you talked to this cafe?” “No, I don’t know them.” A\nwaitress walked by and I flagged her down. “Excuse me, can I speak to the\nowner?” “Umm.” “Don’t worry, it’s nothing bad. This coffee is amazing and I\nwanted to ask him about the story behind the beans.” The owner wasn't around,\nbut with a good excuse in hand, we were soon chatting with the manager. And\nthe manager, in turn, gave us the owner’s contact details and said he’d be in on\nTuesday.\nYou’ve go the ultimate excuse if you have a PhD student on your founding team.\n“Hello, I’m doing my PhD research on the problems around X, it would be a\nhuge help if I could ask you a couple questions for my dissertation.”\nRule of thumb: If it’s a topic you both care about, find an excuse to talk about it.\nYour idea never needs to enter the equation and you’ll both enjoy the chat.\nImmerse yourself in where they are\nI wanted to build tools for public speakers and conference organisers. I knew a\nfew at the lower and middle tiers, but none of the big names who charge $5-50k\nper talk, who I thought might be a good customer segment for obvious reasons. I\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 77\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nhit the conference circuit and gave free talks everywhere I could.\nPermanently on the road, everywhere I went was an opportunity to meet new\nspeakers, do favours for event organisers, and learn what they care about. By\nimmersing myself in the community I met a load of people and soon had all the\nconnections and conversations I could handle (I ultimately decided that big\nspeakers and big conferences were a bad customer segment and walked away—\nnot every conversation has to end in finding out your idea is awesome).\nLanding pages\nJoel Gascoigne did a classic \"landing page\" test with his startup Buffer,\ndescribing the value proposition and collecting emails. But contrary to popular\nunderstanding, it wasn't the metrics or conversion rate which convinced him to\nmove forward. Instead, it was the conversations which resulted from emailing\nevery single person who signed up and saying hello.\nI'm skeptical of the quantitative validation of landing page metrics. But they are\ncertainly a great way to collect emails of qualified leads for you to reach out to\nand strike up a conversation with.\nPaul Graham recommends a generic launch for the same purposes. Get your\nproduct out there, see who seems to like it most, and then reach out to those\nusers.\nThis is starting to bring the customers to you instead of going to them, but still\ninvolves sending a mostly cold email. Next we'll look at how to run with this\nprinciple to make our lives even easier.\nBringing them to you\nWhen you are finding ways to sneak into customer conversations, you're always\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 78\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\non the back foot. You made the approach, so they are suspicious and trying to\nfigure out if you're wasting their time. Instead, we can look for ways to separate\nourselves from the crowd so they can find us. Beyond saving you vast sums of\ntime and frustration, bringing people to you also makes them take you more\nseriously and want to help you more. How can you plant a flag your customers\ncan see? What can you offer them that will make them want to talk to you?\nOrganise meetups\nFor marginally more effort than attending an event, you can organise your own\nand benefit from being the centre of attention.\nWant to figure out the problems HR professionals have? Organise an event\ncalled “HR professionals happy hour”. People will assume you’re credible just\nbecause you happen to be the person who sent the invite emails or introduced\nthe speaker. You'll have an easy time chatting to them about their problems.\nNobody ever follows this recommendation, but it’s the first thing I would do if I\ngot moved a new industry or geography. It’s literally the most unfair trick I know\nfor rapid customer learning. As a bonus, it also instantly bootstraps your\nindustry credibility.\nSpeaking & teaching\nTeaching is under-valued as both a learning and selling tool. Let's say you're\nmaking better project management software. In that case, you probably have\nboth expertise and a strongly held opinion about how things could be better.\nThat’s the magic combination for being an effective teacher.\nSpend the time to teach. You'll find chances at conferences, workshops, through\nonline videos, blogging, or doing free consulting or office hours.\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 79\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nYou'll refine your message, get in touch with a room full of potential customers\nwho take you seriously, and will learn which parts of your offering resonate\n(before you’ve even built it). Then simply chat up the attendees who are most\nkeen.\nIndustry blogging\nIf you have a reasonably sized and relevant blog audience, lining up\nconversations is a total non-issue. You just write a post about it and ask people to\nget in touch. Of course, not everyone has a relevant audience. That’s one big\nreason to start blogging to your customers today.\nEven when I had no audience, I still found blogging to be helpful. When I sent\ncold emails from my blog email address, folks would often meet with me because\nthey had checked my domain, seen my industry blog, and figured I was an\ninteresting person to talk to. In other words, the traffic and audience were\nirrelevant. Blogging about an industry is also a good exercise to get your\nthoughts in a row. It makes you a better customer conversationalist.\nGet clever\nI once heard a brilliant hack from a guy who wanted to sell to top-tier\nuniversities like Stanford and Harvard. But first he needed to understand their\nproblems (difficult) and be taken seriously by the decision makers (even more\ndifficult).\nHis solution was to organise a semi-monthly \"knowledge exchange\" call between\nthe department heads of 3 top universities to discuss the challenges around his\ntopic of choice. Furthermore, it was set up as a conference call where any other\nuniversities could dial in and listen to the best practices of the big 3.\nBy simply organising the call and playing host, he immediately absorbed all the\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 80\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\ncredibility of the top universities and got direct phone access to a pile of great\nleads.\nEvery business is different. Don't just copy what someone else is doing. Consider\nyour own situation, and then get clever.\nCreating warm intros\nWarm intros are the goal. Conversations are infinitely easier when you get an\nintro through a mutual friend that establishes your credibility and reason for\nbeing there.\n7 degrees of bacon\nThe world is a relatively small place. Everyone knows someone. We just have to\nremember to ask.\nI was talking to a team of recent graduates who needed to reach McKinsey style\nconsultants. They were pulling their hair out. We were in a coworking space full\nof other young entrepreneurs, so I just stood on a chair and yelled, “Excuse me!\nDoes anyone here know anyone who works at McKinsey? Can we talk to you for\na second? We’ll buy you a beer — you could really help us out!” They bought 3\nbeers, had 3 quick chats, and left with a diary full of intros.\nThis is even easier for consumer products. Not everyone knows folks at\nMcKinsey, but everybody does know, for example, a recent mom or amateur\nathlete or theatre enthusiast.\nRule of thumb: Kevin Bacon’s 7 degrees of separation applies to customer\nconversations. You can find anyone you need if you ask for it a couple times.\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 81\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nIndustry advisors\nI relied heavily on advisors in my first company. We didn't know the industry\nand nobody took us seriously. Our 5 advisors each had around a half percent of\nequity and basically just made credible intros. I met with each once per month,\nso I ended up getting a fresh batch of intros weekly without it being a huge time\nburden for any of them.\nOn a bit of a tangent, you'd be surprised by the quality of the folks you can get\nto join your advisory board. The first conversation with a good advisor looks\nsimilar to the first conversation with a flagship customer: you get along and are\ntalking about a space you both care about. You can sometimes poach killer\nadvisors from your early customer conversations.\nUniversities\nI'm jealous of founders who are still in (or recently out of) university. Professors\nare a goldmine for intros. They get their grant funding from high-level industry\nfolks they're on good terms with. And since they’re investing in research, those\nindustry folks are self-selected to be excited about new projects.\nProfessors are easy to get in touch with if you don't know them yet. They post\ntheir emails and you can just wander into their office.\nInvestors\nTop-tier investors are awesome for B2B intros. Beyond their own rolodex and\ncompany portfolio, they can usually pull off cold intros to practically any\nindustry. Investors can also help you close higher-tier advisors and directors than\nyou'd be able to wrangle on your own.\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 82\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nWho has bought in to your idea already? Who could they connect you to?\nCash in favours\nRemember all those people who brushed you off by saying, “Sounds great, keep\nme in the loop and let me know how I can help.”\nNow’s the time to call in those favours. Yes, they might not have actually meant\nit, but who cares? Reply back to that ancient email and tell them you’re ready\nfor an intro to that guy they know. Use the format in the next section to make\ntheir lives easy and reassure them that you aren't going to waste anybody's time.\nYou’ll get ignored a lot, but again, who cares? You aren’t trying to minimise your\nfailure rate; you’re trying to get a few conversations going. The person you’re\nbeing introduced to won’t know the backstory anyway, so it’s a clean start from\nthere.\nI wouldn’t make a habit of doing stuff like this since it’s a bit annoying and can\nburn bridges, but sometimes you’re backed into a corner and need to get started\nsomehow.\nAsking for and framing the\nmeeting\nSometimes a proper meeting can't be avoided. For example, you might want the\nfull hour or need to talk to someone senior outside of your peer or networking\ngroup. But since you don't necessarily have anything to sell, it's unclear what the\nmeeting is for. In those cases, the right explanation and framing can do wonders.\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 83\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nIf you don’t know why you’re there, it becomes a sales meeting by default, which\nis bad for 3 reasons. First, the customer closes up about some important topics\nlike pricing. Second, attention shifts to you instead of them. And finally, it’s\ngoing to be the worst sales meeting ever because you aren’t ready.\nSymptoms:\n• “Um. So….”\n• “How’s it going?”\nThere are a lot of bad ways to frame the meeting, both when first asking for it\nand once it begins.\nQuestions like, \"Can I interview you\" or \"Thanks for agreeing to this interview\"\nboth set set off alarm bells that this meeting is going to be super boring. I don't\nwant to be interviewed; I want to talk and help!\nThe common, \"Can I get your opinion on what we're doing?\" sets expectations\nof neediness and that you want compliments or approval.\nNo expectations at all are set by, \"Do you have time for a quick coffee/lunch/\nchat/meeting?\" which suggests you're liable to waste my time.\nThe framing format I like has 5 key elements.\n1. You're an entrepreneur trying to solve horrible problem X, usher in\nwonderful vision Y, or fix stagnant industry Z. Don't mention your idea.\n2. Frame expectations by mentioning what stage you're at and, if it's true,\nthat you don't have anything to sell.\n3. Show weakness and give them a chance to help by mentioning your\nspecific problem that you're looking for answers on. This will also clarify\nthat you're not a time waster.\n4. Put them on a pedestal by showing how much they, in particular, can\nhelp.\n5. Ask for help.\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 84\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nOr, in shorter form: Vision / Framing / Weakness / Pedestal / Ask\nThe mnemonic is “Very Few Wizards Properly Ask [for help].\" Here's what it\nmight look like before you have a product:\nHey Pete,\nI'm trying to make desk & office rental less of a pain for new businesses\n(vision). We're just starting out and don't have anything to sell, but want to\nmake sure we're building something that actually helps (framing).\nI've only ever come at it from the tenant's side and I'm having a hard time\nunderstanding how it all works from the landlord's perspective (weakness).\nYou've been renting out desks for a while and could really help me cut\nthrough the fog (pedestal).\nDo you have time in the next couple weeks to meet up for a chat? (ask)\nSometimes the 5 parts will be combined into just one or two sentences, or they\ncan be in a different order. For example, the next email sounded a little too\npitchy and I was worried he would delete it as sales spam before getting through\nthe first two sentences. As such, I moved my admission of weakness as early as I\ncould get it:\nHey Scott, I run a startup trying to make advertising more playful and\nultimately effective (vision).\nWe're having a load of trouble figuring out how all the pieces of the\nindustry fit together and where we can best fit into it (weakness). You know\nmore about this industry than anyone and could really save us from a ton\nof mistakes (pedestal).\nWe're funded and have a couple products out already, but this is in no way\na sales meeting -- we're just moving into a new area and could really use\nsome of your expertise (framing).\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 85\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nCan you spare a bit of time in the next week to help point us in the right\ndirection over a coffee? (ask)\nPeople like to help entrepreneurs. But they also hate wasting their time. An\nopening like this tells them that you know what you need and that they'll be able\nto make a real difference.\nOnce the meeting starts, you have to grab the reins or it's liable to turn into\nthem drilling you on your idea, which is exactly what you don't want. To do this,\nI basically repeat what I said in the email and then immediately drop into the\nfirst question. If someone else made the introduction, I'll use them as a voice of\nauthority:\nHey Tim, thanks so much for taking the time.\nAs I mentioned in the email, we're trying to make it easier for universities\nto spin out student businesses (vision) and aren't exactly sure how it all\nworks yet (framing & weakness).\nI think Tom made this intro (authority) because you have pretty unique\ninsight into what's going on behind the curtain and could really help us\nget pointed in the right direction (pedestal)… (introductions continue)\nI was looking at your spinout portfolio and it's pretty impressive, especially\ncompany X. How did they get from your classroom to where they are\nnow? (grab the reins and ask good questions)\nThese conversations are easy to screw up. As such, you need to be the one in\ncontrol. You set the agenda, you keep it on topic, and you propose next steps.\nDon't be a jerk about it, but do have a plan for the meeting and be assertive\nabout keeping it on track.\nIt’s worth noting that this is how I set up meetings from warm intros. The main\ngoal is to clarify what I need and how they can help. Cold approaches are a\ntotally different beast and are much more of a gamble. Again, the point of cold\ncalls is to stop having them. Find a clever ways to generate warm intros and tell\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 86\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nthose people how they can help. You’ll have a much easier time.\nTo commute or to call\nOne of the solutions to the time cost of these conversations is to move them\nonto Skype or phone calls. In most situations, I don’t think the added volume\nfrom using calls is worth the information you lose by not being in the room.\nMaybe I'm just bad at this stuff, but I get confused enough by what people are\ntelling me in person. Losing access to their facial expressions or body language\nfeels like shooting myself in the foot.\nMore subtly, calls damage the delicate power dynamic of these conversations.\nWhen someone is having a coffee with you, there’s the potential to chat as\nfriends. You can just shoot the breeze about the industry for a bit. You can keep\nit casual. They’re enjoying the conversation\nThe same is decidedly not true on the phone or Skype. People try to squeeze\ncalls in between other activities. They’re wondering how quickly they can “finish\nwith business” and hang up. Folks on the phone become super annoyed when\nyou “just want to chat”. So you need to make the whole thing more formal and\nplanned, which is one of the exact mistakes we’re trying to avoid!\nPhone calls end up sounding more like scripted interviews than natural\nconversations, because they are. It’s a constraint of the medium.\nPlus, nobody becomes friends over the phone, which means you aren't going to\nget the warm intros and future meetings you need. Setting up a call feels like less\noverhead in the short-term, but that’s because you aren’t yet able to see all the\ntime-saving and business-saving benefits of in-person relationships with your\ncustomers.\nThat being said, some other great people in the field seem to have gotten good\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 87\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nresults using phone calls. Use whatever serves your purpose. But I will say that\nyou should start in person. It’s too easy to use surveys or phone calls as an excuse\nto skip the awkwardness of meeting in person rather than as a considered tradeoff.\nThe advisory flip\nIn terms of mindset, don't go into these discussions looking for customers. It\ncreates a needy vibe and forfeits the position of power. Instead, go in search of\nindustry and customer advisors. You are just trying to find helpful, knowledgable\npeople who are excited about your idea.\nWith that mindset switch, you'll know why you're there. And instead of it being\na customer-learning-but-I-really-want-to-do-sales meeting, it's a let-me-find-outif-you-are-a-good-advisor-by-asking-lots-of-questions meeting.\nWillpower is a finite resource. The way to overcome difficult situations isn't to\npower through, but rather to change your circumstances to require less\nwillpower. Changing the context of the meeting to \"looking for advisors\" is the\nequivalent of throwing out all your chocolate when you start a diet. You change\nthe environment to naturally facilitate your goals.\nYou don't need to explicitly tell them you're looking for advisors. In fact, I\nwouldn't unless you already quite like them and it happens to come up in\nconversation. It's really about orienting your state of mind to give you a helpful\ninternal narrative and consistent front.\nSomewhat counterintuitively, the sales-advisor switch also puts you firmly in\ncontrol of the meeting, since you're now evaluating them. Even if the topics of\ndiscussion are basically the same, you (and they) will notice the difference.\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 88\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nHow many meetings\nEvery meeting has an opportunity cost. While you’re sitting in a bus on your\nway there, you aren’t writing code or generating leads or drinking wine.\nIf you’re running a sales-driven business (especially enterprise sales), the\nopportunity cost of early conversations is low since many of them will become\nsales leads. You’re doubling up on learning and dealflow.\nThe UX community (who knows their customer conversation!) says you should\nkeep talking to people until you stop hearing new information.\nIn my experience, that could take as few as 3-5 conversations if you have a\nrelatively simple industry and a focused customer segment. If you’ve run more\nthan 10 conversations and are still getting results that are all over the map, then\nI’d guess that your customer segment is too fuzzy and could stand to be\ntightened up.\nThis isn’t about having a thousand meetings. It’s about quickly learning what\nyou need, and then getting back to building your business. You should be able to\nanswer almost any customer question and move onto new ones within a week.\nRule of thumb: Keep having conversations until you stop hearing new stuff.\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 89\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nCHAPTER SEVEN\nChoosing your\ncustomers\nThey say that startups don’t starve, they drown. You never have too few options,\ntoo few leads, or too few ideas. You have too many. You get overwhelmed. You\ndo a little bit of everything.\nWhen it comes to avoiding drowning and making faster progress, good customer\nsegmentation is your best friend.\nSegmentation\nWhen we look at the big successes, they seem to serve the whole world. Google\nlets anyone find anything. Paypal helps anyone send money anywhere. Evernote\nbacks up all the writing of everybody.\nBut they didn’t start there. If you start too generic, everything is watered down.\nYour marketing message is generic. You suffer feature creep. Google helped PhD\nstudents find obscure bits of code. EBay helped collectors buy and sell Pez\ndispensers. Evernote helped moms save and share recipes.\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 90\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nWhen you have a fuzzy sense of who you’re serving, you end up talking to a lot\nof different types of people, which leads to confusing signals and three\nproblems:\n1. You get overwhelmed by options and don’t know where to start\n2. You aren’t moving forward but can’t prove yourself wrong\n3. You receive incredibly mixed feedback and can’t make sense of it\nBabies or body builders?\nI talked to a woman who had developed a very cool powdered condiment. It\nwas sweet (like a cinnamon brown sugar), but had all the nutrition of a\nmultivitamin. In fact, it was an all-natural superfood — you could eat nothing\nbut that powder and survive indefinitely.\nShe said that it had countless uses: you could sprinkle it on your breakfast or mix\nit in with your protein shake. Moms could trick their kids into being healthy.\nRestaurants could leave it on the tables as a healthy sugar alternative. However,\nshe was running in circles because the bodybuilders wanted one thing, the\nrestaurants wanted another, and the moms needed a third. Making one of them\nhappy always disappointed the others. She didn’t know how to start.\nBefore we can serve everyone, we have to serve someone. By thinking about who\nwould be most likely to buy, she realised it was moms with young kids who are\ncurrently shopping at health food stores. She also knew where to find them: in\nthe health food stores! But the stores were an important partner and she didn’t\nknow what they would want.\nShe decided to kill two birds with one stone by going into only the small,\nindependent health food stores (slice that segment!) and asking them to place a\nfew bottles of her condiment beside the breakfast foods. It’s a great way to cut\nthrough opinions by asking for a commitment (some shelf space) and she would\ncome back in a week to ask them about their experiences. If the stores were\nhappy and the product sold, she could begin finding ways to talk to their\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 91\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\ncustomers (and her end consumers), perhaps via an in-store tasting.\nBy getting specific, she was able to cut through the noise, stop drowning, and\nstart making progress.\nBig brands or mom & pop?\nI was once thrilled that my customer segment was “advertisers”. Everyone\nadvertises somehow, so naturally this was very exciting. Our market was\npractically infinite! I talked to mom-and-pop shops, e-tailers, big brands, creative\nagencies, SMEs, music labels and more. Everyone I talked to had different\nneeds, constraints, problems, and desires.\nEverything we did ended up sort of working. Everything was somewhat\npromising. Some people were talking about paying us $10,000/month while\nothers scoffed at the idea of paying $10. Every feature was more or less wellreceived. But if we tried to cut any of those middling features, we would get an\nuproar. It was always someone’s favourite part.\nIn reality, our customer segment was just too broad. We were trying to serve\neveryone simultaneously. We said “yes” to every request. Every debate over a\nnew feature could be won by claiming, “Well, those guys would love it.” The\nreverse argument could be made to prevent any feature’s removal.\nThe big trouble was that we could prove ourselves neither right nor wrong. We\ncould never say that a new idea had really worked or totally failed. We were\npaying attention to so many customer segments that there was pretty much\nalways someone it worked for. But making a so-so product for a bunch of\naudiences isn’t quite the same as making an incredible product for one.\nGetting specific about who your ideal customers are allows you to filter out all\nthe noise which comes from everyone else. In our case, we eventually noticed\nunusually strong signals from creative agencies who wanted to be edgy. We cut a\nbunch of features and were finally able to get a sense of what was working and\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 92\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nwhat wasn’t.\nBut what does it mean!?\nI recently spoke to a couple founders who have been working hard on their\ncustomer conversations. They were doing a great job of ensuring they use every\nsales meeting as an opportunity to learn. They’re asking good questions which\npass The Mom Test and are pushing for advancement and commitment\nwhenever it’s relevant. And yet, they have no idea what is going on and aren’t\nsure how to move the business to the next level. They don’t know which features\nto build and which to cut. They don’t know how to improve their marketing\nlanguage. Why aren’t customer conversations helping them?\nTo make matters worse, the feedback they’re getting is absurdly inconsistent. If\nthey run twenty conversations, they end up with twenty different must-have\nfeatures and twenty separate must-solve problems. The more people they talk to,\nthe more confused they get. What’s going on here?\nTheir customer segment was incredibly broad, but in a sneaky way. Imagine I\ntell you my customer segment is “students”. Okay, you say, with a picture of an\nAmerican undergraduate university student in your head. Maybe it’s a male\nstudent. He sits down in the lecture hall, cracks open his mac (adding to the sea\nof glowing apples the professor’s view has recently become), and fires up reddit\nto help him survive the next ninety minutes.\nSo I’ve built a product for students, and feedback starts coming in. But it’s not\nwhat I expect. One user needs to add formal citations. Another wants practice\nquestions. A third needs it to run on the iPad. A fourth needs eighty pupils to be\nable to use it on the same computer. The next needs to use the app through an\nintermittent internet connection. We’re looking at this list of requirements and\nour soul feels like it’s being forced through a colander. This will literally take us\nyears to build. Where do we start?\nIt turns out that “students” is a broader segment than we initially expected. The\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 93\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nfirst is a PhD student. The second is an ambitious youngling at a prep school.\nThe third is a homeschooling parent who wants to use it with her kid. The\nfourth is a rural village in the Indian rice belt where all the local kids are selfeducating through the one village computer. The fifth is in Africa, running the\napp off a shaky cellphone connection. All are “students”.\nThe founders I mentioned were having the same experience, but for “sales\norganisations” instead of “students”. There are countless different kinds of sales\norganisations with fundamentally different needs and workflows and tools and\ngoals. But from the outside, they all look like companies who do sales. Even if\nyou narrow it down with a demographic constraint, as these guys did (sales\norganisations with 25-250 salespeople), you’re still facing unfathomable diversity.\nThey weren’t having 20 conversations with their customers. They were having\none conversation each with 20 different types of customers. That’s why the\nfeedback was so inconsistent. It was as if they were exploring two dozen business\nideas simultaneously.\nIn these cases, talking to an industry expert can be hugely informative to provide\nyou with a taxonomy of the industry. That will give you a better starting point\nfor choosing where to begin. If you don’t have access to this high-level view, you\nstill want to take your best guess and get specific. The next section on Customer\nSlicing will show you one way to approach it. Over time, your understanding of\nthe industry will improve and you can adjust your mental categories as needed.\nWhen the feedback is all over the map, it’s really hard to extract value. Once\nyou get specific, you can learn.\nRule of thumb: If you aren’t finding consistent problems and goals, you don’t yet\nhave a specific enough customer segment.\nCustomer slicing\nIf you’ve already got a product and users, you can explore your way to a good\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 94\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nsegment by seeing who likes it and focusing on that group. The other approach\nis to just make a best-guess. In both cases, you’re ending up with a specific idea\nof who you’re serving so you can really make the features and language resonate\nfor them.\nYou’ll want even more specific segmentation for your conversations than for\nyour whole business. Going out and talking to people is that it takes time. If you\ntalk to five people who each have different goals, you’re going to get mixed\nsignals which don’t give you the confidence you need to move forward.\nThis drilling down into ever more specific groups is called Customer Slicing. You\ntake a segment and then keep slicing off better and better sub-sets of it until\nyou’ve got a tangible sense of who you can go talk to and where you can find\nthem. Start with a broad segment and ask:\n• Within this group, which type of this person would want it most?\n• Would everyone within this group buy/use it, or only some of them?\n• Why do they want it? (e.g. What is their problem or goal)\n• Does everyone in the group have that motivation or only some of them?\n• What additional motivations are there?\n• Which other types of people have these motivations?\nWe now have a two groups of segments: the first is a collection of quite specific\ndemographic groups and the second is a series of motivations. When we look at\nthem, some will be more generic than others. Go back through the generic ones\nand keep slicing. Just repeat the questions above. Within that sub-group, who\nwants it most? Next we’re going to look at our groups’ behaviours and figure out\nwhere to find them.\n• What are these people already doing to achieve their goal or survive their\nproblem?\n• Where can we find our demographic groups?\n• Where can we find people doing the above workaround behaviours?\nAre any of these groups un-findable? If so, go back up the list and slice them\ninto finer pieces until you know where to find them. A customer segment isn’t\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 95\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nvery useful if there’s no way you can get in touch!\nNow that we have a bunch of who-where pairs, we can decide who to start with\nbased on who seems most:\n1. Profitable\n2. Easy to reach\n3. Rewarding for us to build a business around\nFor example, if we were thinking about building an app to help students become\nmore confident speakers, we might decide the best-case-students are graduating\nstudents nervous about their first big job interview. They are motivated not to\nscrew up their big day. Other folks with those motivations might be first-time\nTV/radio guests, someone giving a wedding speech, or new authors who are\nabout to go on book tour. Additional motivations (beyond coping with\nnervousness about a particular event) might be to improve at a valuable longterm skill or to fix some of the quirks of being a non-native speaker. That gives\nus some additional demographics, such as young professionals who have to talk\na lot, such as teachers and salespeople. Or foreign exchange students who are\nabout to graduate. Or non-native speaking PhD students who have an\nupcoming conference talk.\nAs we get specific, it becomes easier to imagine where to find these groups.\nInstead of the generic “students” (I guess I’ll walk around campus?), we can\neasily find non-native speaking PhD students through the admissions office or\nthe department advisors. We know exactly who to look for and won’t waste our\ntime talking to a bunch of irrelevant folks. Or we can find people online. We\nmight reach new authors by searching Amazon’s upcoming release list and then\nreaching out to them on Twitter.\nNow that we’ve got some focused demographics, we also want to look at existing\nbehaviours. A lot of people are terrified of speaking and just ignore it. They\nprobably aren’t going to be our customer. Others talk to a therapist about their\nanxiety in general, while others try to improve speaking in particular by\ngoogling for tips, reading books, or going to workshops and meetups like\nToastmasters. There are more existing solutions (e.g. new salespeople might get\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 96\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\non-the-job training), but you get the idea.\nOnce we know a group’s existing behaviours, it’s incredibly easy to get in touch\nwith them. Nervous wedding speakers might be Googling for examples of great\nwedding speeches. We could advertise on those search terms and offer a bit of\nre-assurance and support in exchange for a quick chat. If someone is listening to\na podcast about speaking skills, we could sponsor it or propose to the host that\nthey run a “call in to talk about your speaking fears and solutions” live event.\nIf this was my business, I would probably shift my preferred customer segment\nfrom “students” to “people scared of public speaking who are trying to get\nbetter.” I would start by going to a Toastmasters meetup since I could have a\ndozen conversations over the course of the evening by Keeping it Casual. That\none evening would give me a great starting point for understanding the\nmotivations, worldview, and needs of a large group of totally ideal customers\nwho are already spending time and money to try to get better.\nOn the other hand, if you were attacking the same vision and happened to be a\nsecret bibliophile, you might choose to start by tracking down some authors who\nare about to go on book tour.\nYou needn’t be planning and theorising all day about this stuff — use it to\nquickly get to a specific, best-possible customer so you can go grab a few of\nthem and move the business forward.\nSince you’ll spend a lot of time talking to your customers, it’s worth choosing\nsomeone who is both accessible and fun for you to be around. This stuff is hard\nwork and can be a real grind if you’re cynical about the people or the industry\nyou’re trying to understand and serve.\nAs we mentioned, you can broaden your segment back out later. Make your life\neasy for now by choosing someone who is specific and who also and meets the\nthree big criteria of being reachable, profitable, and personally rewarding.\nRule of thumb: Good customer segments are a who-where pair. If you don’t know\nwhere to go to find your customers, keep slicing your segment into smaller pieces\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 97\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nuntil you do.\nTalking to the wrong people\nYou can’t get the data you need if you’re talking to the wrong people. There are\n3 ways to end up fall into this clearly unhelpful trap.\n1. You have too-broad of a segment and are talking to everyone\n2. You have multiple customer segments and missed some of them\n3. You are selling to businesses with a complicated buying process and have\noverlooked some of the stakeholders\nWe’ve already talked about #1. If you talk to everyone, many of them are\ninevitably going to be the wrong people.\nYou can miss segments and overlook buyers in lots of ways. The first important\nstep is to know they exist. Sometimes it’s obvious. If you are a multi-sided\nmarketplace, you obviously have multiple customer segments.\nOther times, it’s sneakier. If you’re building an app for kids, need to “sell” to\nboth them and their parents. If you’re building something for public schools,\nyou could potentially be affected by the concerns of the teachers, the students,\nthe administration, the parent-teacher association, and the tax payers.\nYou’ll also need to worry about multiple groups if you rely on an important\npartner, whether for manufacturing, distribution, or promotion. If your business\nrelies on a certain partner, you’d better understand their goals and constraints\njust as well as you understand your customers’.\nDon't just talk to the most senior or important people you can find. You want to\ntalk to people who are representative of your customers, not ones who sound\nimpressive on your status report. When I was building interactive advertising\nproducts, I spent lots of time talking to guys in suits and very little (well, none)\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 98\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\ntalking to the teenagers we were assuming would enjoy using our products.\nTelling my board that I had successfully talked to ten children that week just\ndidn’t seem like the most important thing I could be doing. In retrospect, it\nclearly was.\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 99\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nCHAPTER EIGHT\nRunning the\nprocess\nEven if you do everything else right, you can get bad results if you don’t have\nthe right process wrapped around your conversations. If you just show up to\nmeetings and hope for the best, you aren't making a good use of anyone's time.\nYou need to do a little bit of work before and after to extract full value.\nA common anti-pattern is for the business guy to go to all the meetings and\nsubsequently tell the rest of the team what they should do. Bad idea. Telling the\nrest of the team “What I learned” is functionally equivalent to telling them\n“What you’ll do.” Therefore, owning the customer conversations creates a defacto dictator with “The customer said so” as the ultimate trump card.\nBut as we’ve seen, it’s easy to misinterpret what the customer said.\nWhen all the customer learning is stuck in someone’s head instead of being\ndisseminated to the rest of the team, you’ve got a learning bottleneck. Avoid\ncreating (or being) the bottleneck. To do that, the customer and learning has to\nbe shared with the entire founding team, promptly and faithfully. That relies on\ngood notes plus a bit of pre- and post-meeting work.\nThe most extreme way to bottleneck is to go to the meetings alone and take\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 100\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\ncrappy notes which you don’t review with your team. At that point, your head\nhas become the ultimate repository of customer truth and everyone just has to\ndo what you say.\nIn my case, I bottlenecked so hard that our CTO quit while saying, “We’re\nnever going to succeed if you keep changing what we’re doing.” In my defence,\nthe stuff I’d learned was true (at least, I think it was). But it didn’t matter anyway\nsince I hadn’t properly communicated it to the rest of the team.\nSymptoms of a learning bottleneck:\n• “You just worry about the product. I’ll learn what we need to know.”\n• “Because the customers told me so!”\n• “I don’t have time to talk to people — I need to be coding!”\nAvoiding bottlenecks has three parts: prepping, reviewing, and taking good\nnotes.\nPrepping\nYour most important preparation work is to ensure you know your current list of\n3 big questions. Figure them out with your team and make a point to face the\nscary questions.\nIf you’ve already learned the facts of your customer and industry, then you\nshould also know what commitment and next steps you are going to push for at\nthe end of the meeting.\nIt’s easier to guide the conversation and stay on track if you have an existing set\nof beliefs that you’re updating. Spend up to an hour writing down your best\nguesses about what the person you’re about to talk to cares about and wants.\nYou’ll probably be wrong, but it’s easier to keep the discussion on track and hit\nimportant points if you’ve created a skeleton. If you have an appropriately\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 101\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nfocused segment, then you’ll only rarely need to do this.\nWhile prepping, if you come across a question which could be answered with\ndesk research, take a moment to do it. You want to move past the obvious stuff\nand spend your conversations finding answers the internet can’t give you.\nSimilarly, if you’re about to meet with a business, do your basic due diligence on\nLinkedIn and the company website. It takes 5 minutes and will save you from\nborking the conversation and looking like an idiot.\nSit down with your whole founding team when you prep. You want both\nbusiness and product to be represented. If you leave part of the company out of\nthe prep, then you end up missing their concerns in the customer conversations.\nSome founders react with hostility to the whole idea. They’ll say something\nalong the lines of, “We need to be building the gosh derned product, not fuffing\naround talking to people.” On the surface, it appears to be a refusal to face the\nreality that there might be something wrong with the product’s foundations. But\nhaving seen it in several teams now, I think it’s actually the desire for speed,\nwhere speed is measured by building features instead of by de-risking and\nvalidating the business.\nBeyond asking a grumpy cofounder to “humour me”, there are 2 questions to\nhelp tease out hidden product risks. The first is asking, “If this company fails,\nwhat is most likely to have killed it?” If we had asked that about my very first\nproduct (a user-generated cartoon community), we would have answered that\neither nobody wants to create cartoons or that their cartoons will be so bad that\nnobody wants to watch them. This gives us a good starting point to begin\nexploring with a combination of technical and conversational tools.\nPrep questions to unearth hidden risks:\n• If this company were to fail, why would it have happened?\n• What would have to be true for this to be a huge success?\nThe second question is a flipped version of the first, from Lafley/Martin’s\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 102\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nstrategy book. “What would have to be true for this to be a huge success?” In\nthis case, I might have answered that we need lots of hilarious cartoons plus\nscaling revenue from brand advertisers.\nThese aren’t long, involved strategy discussions. Your gut reaction is enough.\nYou don’t need to be too rigorous. All you’re really trying to figure out is:\n“What do we want to learn from these guys?”\nIn fact, if you’re tight for time, asking this question is the only prep you really\nneed.\nRule of thumb: If you don’t know what you’re trying to learn, you shouldn’t\nbother having the conversation.\nReviewing\nAfter a conversation, just review your notes with your team and update your\nbeliefs and 3 big questions as appropriate.\nThe goal is to ensure the learning is now on paper and in everyone’s head\ninstead of just in yours. Talk through the key quotes and main takeaways of the\nconversation, as well as any problems you ran into.\nI also like to talk about the meta-level of the conversation itself: which questions\nworked and which didn’t? How can we do better next time? Were there any\nimportant signals or questions we missed? This stuff is more craft than science:\nyou have to actively practice it to get better. It’s a valuable skill for your team to\nhave, so it’s worth spending a bit of time improving.\nJust like prepping, reviewing is so simple that it sounds like a non-step. It’s\ntempting to skip it. Don’t! The review is important. Disseminate learnings to\nyour team as quickly and as directly as possible, using notes and exact quotes\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 103\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nwherever you can. It keeps you in sync, leads to better decisions, prevents\narguments, and allows your whole team to benefit from the learning you’ve\nworked so hard to acquire.\nWho should show up\nEveryone on the team who is making big decisions (including tech decisions)\nneeds to go to at least some of the meetings. The tech guys don’t need to go to\nmost of the meetings, but you’ll all learn a ton from hearing customer reactions\nfirst-hand occasionally. You’ll also be able to help each other catch and fix your\nconversation mistakes and biases.\nMeetings go best when you've got two people at them. One person can focus on\ntaking notes and the other can focus on talking. As the second person,\nsometimes you'll notice the lead asking bad questions or missing a signal they\nshould be digging into. Just jump in and fix them.\nDon’t send more than two people unless it’s group-on-group or you’ve got a\nparticularly good reason to do so. Three folks interviewing someone can be a\nlittle overwhelming.\nGoing in solo is fine once you get good at taking concise notes. The main\nproblem of running solo is that it's harder to catch yourself and recover once\nyou start going off-track asking bad questions or missing the point.\nIf you’re shy and have no cofounder to take the lead, call in a favour with a\nfriend to come to your first couple conversations with you. You can just play the\nrole of the note-taker until you’re comfortable. If there’s no workaround and\nyou have to bite the bullet, remember that confidence is domain-specific. Instead\nof suffering through, focus on getting better and understanding the process. It\nwill get less scary as you improve.\nYou can't outsource or hire someone to do customer learning. There are\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 104\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nexceptional team dynamics where it works, but generally speaking, the founders\nneed to be in the meetings themselves. When a hired gun brings you bad news\n(“This problem isn't real and nobody cares about what we're doing”), properly\nassimilating it is difficult.\nMore insidiously, if the signal is lukewarm, it’s tempting for a hire to gloss over\nit. Hiring out your learning is a guaranteed way to get bad signals. Until you've\ngot a working business model and a repeatable sales or marketing process, the\nfounders need to be in the meetings themselves.\nOn the bright side, even though you have to be in the room to process the\nlearning, you don't necessarily have to be the one setting up or leading the\nmeetings. You can hire people to help as long as you’re there with them,\nlistening.\nHow to write it down\nTaking good notes is the best way to keep your team (and investors and advisors)\nin the loop. Plus, notes make it harder to lie to yourself. And when, months later,\nyou decide to adjust the business's direction, you'll be able to return to your\nnotes instead of having to go do a whole new set of interviews.\nWhen possible, write down exact quotes. Wrap them in quotation marks so you\nknow it's verbatim. You can later use them in your marketing language,\nfundraising decks, and to resolve arguments with skeptical teammates. Other\ntimes the exact quote isn't relevant and you just write down the big idea.\nIn either case, add symbols to your notes as context and shorthand. I use 12\nmain symbols and make up more in the field as I need them. You probably\nwon't exactly copy mine, so don't worry about memorising them. You'll build\nyour own go-to list as you have more conversations.\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 105\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\n:) :( :| \u0001 ⨅ ☐ 㽉 ^ ☑＄♀☆\nEmotions\n:) Excited\n:( Angry\n:| Embarrassed\nSomeone saying \"that's a problem\" should be interpreted totally differently\ndepending on whether they are neutral or outraged. Any strong emotion is\nworth writing down. For example, depending on your industry, you might also\nchoose to make symbols for lust or laughter. Capture the big emotions and\nremember to dig into them when they come up.\nTheir life\n\u0001 Pain or problem (symbol is a lightning bolt)\n⨅ Goal or job-to-be-done (symbol is a soccer/football goal)\n☐ Obstacle\n㽉 Workaround\n^ Background or context (symbol is a distant mountain)\nThese five “life” symbols are your bread and butter. Combine them with\nemotion symbols where appropriate. Pains and obstacles carry a lot more weight\nwhen someone is embarrassed or angry about them.\nObstacles are preventing a customer from solving their problems even though\nthey want to. They're important because you'll probably also have to deal with\nthem. For example, a lot of corporate folks would love to use cloud services and\nhate their current options, but can't use anything else because their company's\nIT policy is an obstacle. Their workaround might be to use their personal phone\nas a secondary computer or by doing certain work at home. Also worth noting.\nSpecifics\n☑ Feature request or purchasing criteria\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 106\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\n＄ Money or budgets or purchasing process\n♀ Mentioned a specific person or company\n☆ Follow-up task\nAs we discussed, feature requests usually get ignored, but they're a good signal to\ncapture and explore. Must-have purchasing criteria are obviously more\nimportant. Money signals are also key.\nWrite down specific names and companies. If it’s someone they know, ask for an\nintro at the end of the conversation. If it’s a competitor or alternate solution,\nwrite it down to research it later.\nPut a big star on items to follow-up on after the meeting, especially next steps\nyou promised as a condition of their advancement/commitment.\nWhere to write it down\nYou want to take your customer notes so that they are:\n• Able to be sorted, mixed, and re-arranged\n• Able to be combined with the notes of the rest of your team\n• Permanent and retrievable\n• Not mixed in with other random noise like todo lists and ideas\nIn practice, I’ve found that taking notes in my primary notebook is practically\nuseless. Over the course of several months’ sprawl, you set an insurmountable\nsearch and retrieval task for yourself. If you won’t look at your notes, they aren’t\nmuch good.\nIf you do end up taking notes in non-ideal places, you just need to spend a little\nextra post-meeting time moving them over into your permanent format.\nOtherwise you’ll be kicking yourself when you remember that amazing quote\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 107\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nsomeone gave you which you can’t quite remember well enough to convince\nthose skeptical investors.\nWhat is a better note-taking medium?\nGoogle Docs spreadsheets and Evernote are both great for team sharing, search,\nand retrieval. Spreadsheets are wonderfully sortable if you write your key signals\nin their own column. The downside is that it comes across as rude to take notes\ndirectly on a computer during a meeting, so you add a bit of mandatory postmeeting work to transfer your notes. I always found this a bit annoying, but it’s\nway better than losing your learning in an off-topic notebook.\nA dedicated notebook is fine, if you can remember to carry it with you and use\nit. For a while, I would use my regular notebook for my customer notes and then\njust tear out every page which wasn’t from an interview so it was easier to find\nthem later. Hardly the most elegant.\nMy favourite medium is index cards. Post-it notes also work. I carry around\nblank cards and take notes on them, with one quote or learning per card (along\nwith a signal icon, of course). After the meeting I jot down the date and name\nof the person on each card. It takes a couple minutes, but it’s faster than moving\nover all your notes. When we review, we lay the cards out on the table and sort\nthrough them. Cards are great because of the random access and sorting. If you\nlearn that the problem you’re solving doesn’t really matter, you can just pull out\nall the cards marked with a lightning bolt and find yourself a new problem that’s\nalready been confirmed.\nWhen I first started, I would make audio recordings, but that suffered from the\nsame problem as notebooks. I'd end up with a ton of content and no real way to\nsort it or find the bit I wanted, so I ended up ignoring the recordings.\nIf you do want to use audio, you’ll find people are surprisingly willing to be\nrecorded. Put your phone on the table as you sit down and say, “Hey, is it cool if\nI record this, because I’m always paranoid I’ll miss something important in my\nnotes. It won’t get shared with anyone or posted anywhere.” Almost everyone\nsays yes, but it does blow your cover if you’re trying to Keep it Casual.\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 108\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nIf you embrace Keeping it Casual, you'll find customer conversations appearing\nout of nowhere and catching you by surprise. Just go with it. I've got notes\nwritten on paper plates from a pizza party, on beer mats from the pub, and on\nnewspapers from the cafe. You'll want to transfer them over to your main\nstorage system once you get back to the office, but it's better to capture what's\nsaid on something weird than to try to remember all the important bits.\nIf it’s totally inappropriate to take notes during the chat, just have the\nconversation and then immediately retreat to a corner to write down what was\nsaid. This is how I usually handle customer conversations at the pub or\nconferences.\nRegardless of the medium, the most important thing is that the notes are\nlightweight enough that you'll actually review them yourself and with your\nteam.\nRule of thumb: Notes are useless if you don't look at them.\nThe process\nTalking to customers is a tool, not an obligation. If it’s not going to help or you\ndon’t want to do it for whatever reason, just skip it. I’m sure you’ve been on the\nreceiving end of a half-assed survey sent out by some new startup to tick the box\nmarked “learn from customers” on their startup todo list. There are better ways\nto waste your time.\nWithout figuring out what actually matters to your company and how to deal\nwith it effectively, you’re just going through the motions. When it comes to\nconversations, it looks like this:\nSigns that you’re just going through the motions:\n• You’re talking more than they are\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 109\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\n• They are complimenting you or your idea\n• You told them about your idea and don’t know what’s happening next\n• You don’t have notes\n• You haven’t looked through your notes with your team\n• You got an unexpected answer and it didn’t change your idea\n• You weren’t scared of any of the questions you asked\n• You aren’t sure which big question you’re trying to answer by doing this\nThe persistent presence of any of these problems suggests that you’re doing\nsomething wrong and wasting your time.\nHere are the steps I go through to keep on track. Feel free to ignore or tweak as\nneeded given your situation and company. It’s as light-weight as I’ve been able to\nget it and should reduce rather than increase the amount of time you need to\nspend on conversations.\nBefore a batch of conversations:\n• If you haven’t yet, choose a focused, findable segment\n• With your team, decide your big 3 learning goals\n• If relevant, decide on ideal next steps and commitments\n• If conversations are the right tool, figure out who to talk to\n• Create a series of best guesses about what the person cares about\n• If a question could be answered via desk research, do that first\nDuring the conversation:\n• Frame the conversation\n• Keep it casual\n• Ask good questions which pass The Mom Test\n• Deflect compliments, anchor fluff, and dig beneath signals\n• Take good notes\n• If relevant, press for commitment and next steps\nAfter a batch of conversations:\n• With your team, review your notes and key customer quotes\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 110\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\n• If relevant, transfer notes into permanent storage\n• Update your beliefs and plans\n• Decide on the next 3 big questions\nThe goal of this process is twofold. Firstly, to make sure you're spending your\ntime well by attacking the questions which really matter and using the whole\nfounding team’s brains. Secondly, to spread any new learning through your team\nas quickly and completely as possible.\nThere you go. Now you know everything I do about how to learn from\nconversations. Combine this process with The Mom Test, Keeping it Casual,\nand Advancement for maximum learning in minimum time. But even if it goes\nwrong, don’t worry so much. Eternity will forgive.\nYou'll always make mistakes\nI still ask dumb questions all the time. You will too. Don’t beat yourself up over\nit. In fact, just yesterday I screwed up a particularly important meeting by\nslipping into pitch mode (this was yesterday at the time of writing… hopefully\nnot again at the time of reading).\nIt happens. It’s okay. Review with your team, don’t beat yourself up (or your\ncofounders) over mistakes. Work on getting better as a team.\nI make tons of mistakes. At least now I notice and have a chance to fix them.\nMost bad conversations can be fixed. You’re trying to do something difficult.\nYou’re never going to be perfect, but it always helps to be better.\nPeople love startups. Startups do cool stuff and make their lives better. Everyone\nsupports the entrepreneur. When entrepreneurs screw up, people want to forgive\nthem. They want the entrepreneur and the startup to succeed.\nBy asking good questions, we can fix many flawed ideas before they get us in\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 111\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\ntrouble. But still, sometimes it doesn’t work out. It’s okay. Go to the people who\nbelieved in and supported you and thank them. If relevant, apologise. They’ll\nsay something like:\n“Hey, don’t even worry about it — I know how it goes.”\nEternity will forgive our earthly blunders. Everyone loves an entrepreneur. After\nall, you’re putting it on the line to try and make their lives better.\nRule of thumb: It’s going to be okay.\nHack it\nIn ancient times it was prophesied that whoever undid the convoluted Gordian\nKnot would rule the land. Coming across the knot, Alexander drew his sword\nand with a single stroke, cut the knot in half. The knot was undone and he\nbecame “the Great”.\nStruggling to untie the knot was the “proper” process. Cutting through it was a\nhack (ba-dum tish!). Alexander jumped straight to the end result without any of\nthe work.\nWhen we find a new and exciting process, it’s easy to spend hours obsessively\ngeeking out about exactly the right way to untie this big, gnarly knot.\nAt a workshop about customer segmentation, a personal trainer said he was\nspending most of his time on the non-billable commutes between his clients. At\nsome point it was suggested that the police might be a better customer, since he\ncould go to the station and spend all day working with different officers. No\ncommute, more billable hours, and a less price-sensitive customer. Sounds good\nin theory.\nWe all started geeking out about how he was going to validate this. Who could\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 112\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nhe talk to? Did anyone have family in the police? What should his interview\nquestions be? What was the market size? Etc etc.\nHe looked at us like we were all idiots and held up his phone. “Why wouldn’t I\njust call them?” It’s not like he didn’t know their number. We all stood around a\nbit dumbfounded while he went outside and called the police. Twenty minutes\nlater, he came back in with a trial session scheduled.\nHaving a process is valuable, but don’t get stuck in it. Sometimes you can just\npick up the phone and hack through the knot.\nThis stuff is fast\nThe time scales of the process are important. The point is to make your business\nmove faster, not slower.\nDon’t spend a week prepping for meetings; spend an hour and then go talk to\npeople. Anything more is stalling.\nDon’t spend months doing full-time customer conversations before beginning to\nmove on a product. Spend a week, maybe two. Get your bearings and then give\nthem something to commit to.\nYou’ll keep talking to customers for the life of your company, of course. I’m not\nadvising you to become a recluse after the first two weeks. Your customers are a\ncrucial source of ongoing insight and will help catch any badgers in the bush, so\nto speak. With the tools in this book (especially Keeping it Casual) you should be\nable to keep benefitting from customer learning without spending any real time\non it. You can do it alongside growing your business rather than in place of it.\nThis stuff moves really quickly when you’re doing it right. This book isn’t meant\nyou an excuse to squander precious months on theorising. It’s meant to help you\nextract maximum value in minimum time from conversations so you can get\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 113\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nback to what really matters: building your business.\nRule of thumb: Go build your dang company already.\nThe Mom Test by @robfitz 114\nmomtestbook.com / foundercentric.com\nConclusion and\ncheatsheet\nIt’s been fun.

It was because of that friendship, and that belief, that we set out on the journey to explore the\nideas in this book and eventually came to write it.\nWe met twenty years ago in a classroom—one the professor, the\nother the student. And we have worked together ever since, often\nseeing ourselves along the journey as two wet rats in a drain. This\nbook is not the victory of an idea but of a friendship that we have\nfound more meaningful than any idea in the world of business. It has\nmade our lives rich and our worlds more beautiful. We were not alone.\nNo journey is easy; no friendship is filled only with laughter. But\nwe were excited every day of that journey because we were on a mission to learn and improve. We believe passionately in the ideas in\nthis book. These ideas are not for those whose ambition in life is to\nget by or merely to survive. That was never an interest of ours. If\nyou can be satisfied with that, do not read on. But if you want to\nmake a difference, to create a company that builds a future where\ncustomers, employees, shareholders, and society win, read on. We\nare not saying it is easy, but it is worthwhile.\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n\nOur research confirms that there are no permanently excellent\ncompanies, just as there are no permanently excellent industries.\nAs we have found on our own tumbling road, we all, like corporations, do smart things and less-than-smart things. To improve the\nquality of our success we need to study what we did that made a\npositive difference and understand how to replicate it systematically. That is what we call making smart strategic moves, and we\nhave found that the strategic move that matters centrally is to create blue oceans.\nBlue ocean strategy challenges companies to break out of the red\nocean of bloody competition by creating uncontested market space\nthat makes the competition irrelevant. Instead of dividing up existing—and often shrinking—demand and benchmarking competitors, blue ocean strategy is about growing demand and breaking\naway from the competition. This book not only challenges companies but also shows them how to achieve this. We first introduce a\nset of analytical tools and frameworks that show you how to systematically act on this challenge, and, second, we elaborate the\nprinciples that define and separate blue ocean strategy from competition-based strategic thought.\nOur aim is to make the formulation and execution of blue ocean\nstrategy as systematic and actionable as competing in the red waters of known market space. Only then can companies step up to\nthe challenge of creating blue oceans in a smart and responsible\nway that is both opportunity maximizing and risk minimizing. No\ncompany—large or small, incumbent or new entrant—can afford to\nbe a riverboat gambler. And no company should.\nThe contents of this book are based on more than fifteen years of\nresearch, data stretching back more than a hundred years, and a series of Harvard Business Review articles as well as academic articles on various dimensions of this topic. The ideas, tools, and\nframeworks presented here have been further tested and refined\nover the years in corporate practice in Europe, the United States,\nand Asia. This book builds on and extends this work by providing a\nnarrative arc that draws these ideas together to offer a unified\nx Preface\n\nframework. This framework addresses not only the analytic aspects behind the creation of blue ocean strategy but also the allimportant human aspects of how to bring an organization and its\npeople on this journey with a willingness to execute these ideas in\naction. Here, understanding how to build trust and commitment, as\nwell as an understanding of the importance of intellectual and\nemotional recognition, are highlighted and brought to the core of\nstrategy.\nBlue ocean opportunities have been out there. As they have been\nexplored, the market universe has been expanding. This expansion,\nwe believe, is the root of growth. Yet poor understanding exists\nboth in theory and in practice as to how to systematically create\nand capture blue oceans. We invite you to read this book to learn\nhow you can be a driver of this expansion in the future.\nPreface xi\n\n\nAcknowledgments\nWE HAVE HAD SIGNIFICANT HELP in actualizing\nthis book.

Created in 1984 by a group\nof street performers, Cirque’s productions have been seen by almost\nforty million people in ninety cities around the world. In less than\ntwenty years Cirque du Soleil has achieved a level of revenues that\ntook Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey—the global champion of\nthe circus industry—more than one hundred years to attain.\nWhat makes this rapid growth all the more remarkable is that it\nwas not achieved in an attractive industry but rather in a declining\nindustry in which traditional strategic analysis pointed to limited\npotential for growth. Supplier power on the part of star performers\nwas strong. So was buyer power. Alternative forms of entertainment—ranging from various kinds of urban live entertainment to\nsporting events to home entertainment—cast an increasingly long\nshadow. Children cried out for PlayStations rather than a visit to\nthe traveling circus. Partially as a result, the industry was suffering from steadily decreasing audiences and, in turn, declining revenue and profits. There was also increasing sentiment against the\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n\nuse of animals in circuses by animal rights groups. Ringling Bros.\nand Barnum & Bailey set the standard, and competing smaller circuses essentially followed with scaled-down versions. From the perspective of competition-based strategy, then, the circus industry\nappeared unattractive.\nAnother compelling aspect of Cirque du Soleil’s success is that\nit did not win by taking customers from the already shrinking circus\nindustry, which historically catered to children. Cirque du Soleil\ndid not compete with Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey. Instead\nit created uncontested new market space that made the competition irrelevant. It appealed to a whole new group of customers:\nadults and corporate clients prepared to pay a price several times\nas great as traditional circuses for an unprecedented entertainment experience. Significantly, one of the first Cirque productions\nwas titled “We Reinvent the Circus.”\nNew Market Space\nCirque du Soleil succeeded because it realized that to win in the future, companies must stop competing with each other. The only way\nto beat the competition is to stop trying to beat the competition.\nTo understand what Cirque du Soleil has achieved, imagine a\nmarket universe composed of two sorts of oceans: red oceans and\nblue oceans. Red oceans represent all the industries in existence\ntoday. This is the known market space. Blue oceans denote all the\nindustries not in existence today. This is the unknown market space.\nIn the red oceans, industry boundaries are defined and accepted,\nand the competitive rules of the game are known.1 Here, companies\ntry to outperform their rivals to grab a greater share of existing demand. As the market space gets crowded, prospects for profits and\ngrowth are reduced. Products become commodities, and cutthroat\ncompetition turns the red ocean bloody.\nBlue oceans, in contrast, are defined by untapped market space,\ndemand creation, and the opportunity for highly profitable growth.\n4 BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY\n\nAlthough some blue oceans are created well beyond existing industry boundaries, most are created from within red oceans by expanding existing industry boundaries, as Cirque du Soleil did. In blue\noceans, competition is irrelevant because the rules of the game are\nwaiting to be set.\nIt will always be important to swim successfully in the red ocean\nby outcompeting rivals. Red oceans will always matter and will always be a fact of business life. But with supply exceeding demand\nin more industries, competing for a share of contracting markets,\nwhile necessary, will not be sufficient to sustain high performance.2\nCompanies need to go beyond competing. To seize new profit and\ngrowth opportunities, they also need to create blue oceans.\nUnfortunately, blue oceans are largely uncharted. The dominant\nfocus of strategy work over the past twenty-five years has been on\ncompetition-based red ocean strategies.3 The result has been a\nfairly good understanding of how to compete skillfully in red waters,\nfrom analyzing the underlying economic structure of an existing\nindustry, to choosing a strategic position of low cost or differentiation or focus, to benchmarking the competition. Some discussions\naround blue oceans exist.4 However, there is little practical guidance on how to create them. Without analytic frameworks to create\nblue oceans and principles to effectively manage risk, creating\nblue oceans has remained wishful thinking that is seen as too risky\nfor managers to pursue as strategy. This book provides practical\nframeworks and analytics for the systematic pursuit and capture of\nblue oceans.\nThe Continuing Creation of Blue Oceans\nAlthough the term blue oceans is new, their existence is not. They\nare a feature of business life, past and present. Look back one hundred years and ask yourself, How many of today’s industries were\nthen unknown? The answer: Many industries as basic as automobiles, music recording, aviation, petrochemicals, health care, and\nCreating Blue Oceans 5\n\nmanagement consulting were unheard of or had just begun to\nemerge at that time. Now turn the clock back only thirty years.\nAgain, a plethora of multibillion-dollar industries jumps out—mutual funds, cell phones, gas-fired electricity plants, biotechnology,\ndiscount retail, express package delivery, minivans, snowboards,\ncoffee bars, and home videos, to name a few. Just three decades ago,\nnone of these industries existed in a meaningful way.\nNow put the clock forward twenty years—or perhaps fifty years—\nand ask yourself how many now unknown industries will likely\nexist then. If history is any predictor of the future, again the answer\nis many of them.\nThe reality is that industries never stand still. They continuously evolve. Operations improve, markets expand, and players\ncome and go. History teaches us that we have a hugely underestimated capacity to create new industries and re-create existing\nones. In fact, the half-century-old Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system published by the U.S. Census was replaced in 1997\nby the North America Industry Classification Standard (NAICS)\nsystem. The new system expanded the ten SIC industry sectors into\ntwenty sectors to reflect the emerging realities of new industry territories.5 The services sector under the old system, for example, is\nnow expanded into seven business sectors ranging from information to health care and social assistance.6 Given that these systems\nare designed for standardization and continuity, such a replacement shows how significant the expansion of blue oceans has been.\nYet the overriding focus of strategic thinking has been on competition-based red ocean strategies. Part of the explanation for this\nis that corporate strategy is heavily influenced by its roots in military strategy. The very language of strategy is deeply imbued with\nmilitary references—chief executive “officers” in “headquarters,”\n“troops” on the “front lines.” Described this way, strategy is about\nconfronting an opponent and fighting over a given piece of land\nthat is both limited and constant.7 Unlike war, however, the history of industry shows us that the market universe has never been\nconstant; rather, blue oceans have continuously been created over\n6 BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY\n\ntime. To focus on the red ocean is therefore to accept the key\nconstraining factors of war—limited terrain and the need to beat\nan enemy to succeed—and to deny the distinctive strength of the\nbusiness world: the capacity to create new market space that is uncontested.\nThe Impact of Creating Blue Oceans\nWe set out to quantify the impact of creating blue oceans on a company’s growth in both revenues and profits in a study of the business launches of 108 companies (see figure 1-1). We found that 86\npercent of the launches were line extensions, that is, incremental\nimprovements within the red ocean of existing market space. Yet\nthey accounted for only 62 percent of total revenues and a mere 39\npercent of total profits. The remaining 14 percent of the launches\nwere aimed at creating blue oceans. They generated 38 percent of\ntotal revenues and 61 percent of total profits. Given that business\nlaunches included the total investments made for creating red and\nblue oceans (regardless of their subsequent revenue and profit consequences, including failures), the performance benefits of creating\nCreating Blue Oceans 7\nFIGURE 1-1\nThe Profit and Growth Consequences of Creating Blue Oceans\nLaunches within red oceans Launches for creating blue oceans\nBusiness Launch\nRevenue Impact\nProfit Impact\n86% 14%\n62% 38%\n39% 61%\n\nblue waters are evident. Although we don’t have data on the hit rate\nof success of red and blue ocean initiatives, the global performance\ndifferences between them are marked.\nThe Rising Imperative of Creating Blue Oceans\nThere are several driving forces behind a rising imperative to create\nblue oceans. Accelerated technological advances have substantially\nimproved industrial productivity and have allowed suppliers to produce an unprecedented array of products and services. The result\nis that in increasing numbers of industries, supply exceeds demand.8 The trend toward globalization compounds the situation.\nAs trade barriers between nations and regions are dismantled and\nas information on products and prices becomes instantly and globally available, niche markets and havens for monopoly continue to\ndisappear.9 While supply is on the rise as global competition intensifies, there is no clear evidence of an increase in demand worldwide, and statistics even point to declining populations in many\ndeveloped markets.10\nThe result has been accelerated commoditization of products\nand services, increasing price wars, and shrinking profit margins.\nRecent industrywide studies on major American brands confirm\nthis trend.11 They reveal that for major product and service categories, brands are generally becoming more similar, and as they are\nbecoming more similar people increasingly select based on price.12\nPeople no longer insist, as in the past, that their laundry detergent\nbe Tide. Nor will they necessarily stick to Colgate when Crest is on\nsale, and vice versa. In overcrowded industries, differentiating brands\nbecomes harder in both economic upturns and downturns.\nAll this suggests that the business environment in which most\nstrategy and management approaches of the twentieth century\nevolved is increasingly disappearing. As red oceans become increasingly bloody, management will need to be more concerned with blue\noceans than the current cohort of managers is accustomed to.\n8 BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY\n\nFrom Company and Industry to Strategic Move\nHow can a company break out of the red ocean of bloody competition? How can it create a blue ocean? Is there a systematic approach to achieve this and thereby sustain high performance?\nIn search of an answer, our initial step was to define the basic\nunit of analysis for our research. To understand the roots of high\nperformance, the business literature typically uses the company as\nthe basic unit of analysis. People have marveled at how companies\nattain strong, profitable growth with a distinguished set of strategic, operational, and organizational characteristics. Our question,\nhowever, was this: Are there lasting “excellent” or “visionary”\ncompanies that continuously outperform the market and repeatedly create blue oceans?\nConsider, for example, In Search of Excellence and Built to Last.\n13\nThe bestselling book In Search of Excellence was published twenty\nyears ago. Yet within two years of its publication a number of the\ncompanies surveyed began to slip into oblivion: Atari, ChesebroughPond’s, Data General, Fluor, National Semiconductor. As documented in Managing on the Edge, two-thirds of the identified model\nfirms in the book had fallen from their perches as industry leaders\nwithin five years of its publication.14\nThe book Built to Last continued in the same footsteps. It sought\nout the “successful habits of visionary companies” that had a longrunning track record of superior performance. To avoid the pitfalls\nof In Search of Excellence, however, the survey period of Built to\nLast was expanded to the entire life span of the companies while its\nanalysis was limited to firms more than forty years old. Built to\nLast also became a bestseller.\nBut again, upon closer examination, deficiencies in some of the\nvisionary companies spotlighted in Built to Last have come to light.\nAs illustrated in the recent book Creative Destruction, much of the\nsuccess attributed to some of the model companies in Built to Last\nwas the result of industry sector performance rather than the\nCreating Blue Oceans 9\n\ncompanies themselves.15 For example, Hewlett-Packard (HP) met\nthe criteria of Built to Last by outperforming the market over the\nlong term. In reality, while HP outperformed the market, so did the\nentire computer-hardware industry. What’s more, HP did not even\noutperform the competition within the industry. Through this and\nother examples, Creative Destruction questioned whether “visionary”\ncompanies that continuously outperform the market have ever existed. And we all have seen the stagnating or declining performance\nof the Japanese companies that were celebrated as “revolutionary”\nstrategists in their heyday of the late 1970s and early 1980s.\nIf there is no perpetually high-performing company and if the\nsame company can be brilliant at one moment and wrongheaded at\nanother, it appears that the company is not the appropriate unit of\nanalysis in exploring the roots of high performance and blue oceans.\nAs discussed earlier, history also shows that industries are constantly being created and expanded over time and that industry\nconditions and boundaries are not given; individual actors can\nshape them. Companies need not compete head-on in a given industry space; Cirque du Soleil created a new market space in the entertainment sector, generating strong, profitable growth as a result. It\nappears, then, that neither the company nor the industry is the best\nunit of analysis in studying the roots of profitable growth.\nConsistent with this observation, our study shows that the\nstrategic move, and not the company or the industry, is the right\nunit of analysis for explaining the creation of blue oceans and sustained high performance. A strategic move is the set of managerial\nactions and decisions involved in making a major market-creating\nbusiness offering. Compaq, for example, was acquired by HewlettPackard in 2001 and ceased to be an independent company. As a result, many people might judge the company as unsuccessful. This\ndoes not, however, invalidate the blue ocean strategic moves that\nCompaq made in creating the server industry. These strategic\nmoves not only were a part of the company’s powerful comeback in\nthe mid-1990s but also unlocked a new multibillion-dollar market\nspace in computing.\n10 BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY\n\nAppendix A, “A Sketch of the Historical Pattern of Blue Ocean\nCreation,” provides a snapshot overview of the history of three representative U.S. industries drawn from our database: the auto industry—how we get to work; the computer industry—what we use\nat work; and the cinema industry—where we go after work for enjoyment. As shown in appendix A, no perpetually excellent company or industry is found. But a striking commonality appears to\nexist across strategic moves that have created blue oceans and have\nled to new trajectories of strong, profitable growth.\nThe strategic moves we discuss—moves that have delivered products and services that opened and captured new market space, with\na significant leap in demand—contain great stories of profitable\ngrowth as well as thought-provoking tales of missed opportunities\nby companies stuck in red oceans. We built our study around these\nstrategic moves to understand the pattern by which blue oceans are\ncreated and high performance achieved. We studied more than one\nhundred fifty strategic moves made from 1880 to 2000 in more than\nthirty industries, and we closely examined the relevant business\nplayers in each of these events. Industries ranged from hotels, the\ncinema, retail, airlines, energy, computers, broadcasting, and construction to automobiles and steel. We analyzed not only winning\nbusiness players who created blue oceans but also their less successful competitors.\nBoth within a given strategic move and across strategic moves,\nwe searched for convergence among the group that created blue\noceans and within less successful players caught in the red ocean.\nWe also searched for divergence across these two groups. In so\ndoing, we tried to discover the common factors leading to the creation of blue oceans and the key differences separating those winners from the mere survivors and the losers adrift in the red ocean.\nOur analysis of more than thirty industries confirms that neither\nindustry nor organizational characteristics explain the distinction\nbetween the two groups. In assessing industry, organizational, and\nstrategic variables we found that the creation and capturing of blue\noceans were achieved by small and large companies, by young and\nCreating Blue Oceans 11\n\nold managers, by companies in attractive and unattractive industries, by new entrants and established incumbents, by private and\npublic companies, by companies in low- and high-tech industries,\nand by companies of diverse national origins.\nOur analysis failed to find any perpetually excellent company or\nindustry. What we did find behind the seemingly idiosyncratic success stories, however, was a consistent and common pattern across\nstrategic moves for creating and capturing blue oceans. Whether it\nwas Ford in 1908 with the Model T; GM in 1924 with cars styled to\nappeal to the emotions; CNN in 1980 with real-time news 24/7; or\nCompaq, Starbucks, Southwest Airlines, or Cirque du Soleil—or,\nfor that matter, any of the other blue ocean moves in our study—the\napproach to strategy in creating blue oceans was consistent across\ntime regardless of industry. Our research also reached out to embrace famous strategic moves in public sector turnarounds. Here\nwe found a strikingly similar pattern.\nValue Innovation: The Cornerstone\nof Blue Ocean Strategy\nWhat consistently separated winners from losers in creating blue\noceans was their approach to strategy. The companies caught in\nthe red ocean followed a conventional approach, racing to beat the\ncompetition by building a defensible position within the existing\nindustry order.16 The creators of blue oceans, surprisingly, didn’t\nuse the competition as their benchmark.17 Instead, they followed a\ndifferent strategic logic that we call value innovation. Value innovation is the cornerstone of blue ocean strategy. We call it value innovation because instead of focusing on beating the competition,\nyou focus on making the competition irrelevant by creating a leap\nin value for buyers and your company, thereby opening up new and\nuncontested market space.\nValue innovation places equal emphasis on value and innovation. Value without innovation tends to focus on value creation on\n12 BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY\n\nan incremental scale, something that improves value but is not sufficient to make you stand out in the marketplace.18 Innovation without value tends to be technology-driven, market pioneering, or\nfuturistic, often shooting beyond what buyers are ready to accept\nand pay for.19 In this sense, it is important to distinguish between\nvalue innovation as opposed to technology innovation and market\npioneering. Our study shows that what separates winners from losers in creating blue oceans is neither bleeding-edge technology nor\n“timing for market entry.” Sometimes these exist; more often, however, they do not. Value innovation occurs only when companies\nalign innovation with utility, price, and cost positions. If they fail\nto anchor innovation with value in this way, technology innovators\nand market pioneers often lay the eggs that other companies hatch.\nValue innovation is a new way of thinking about and executing\nstrategy that results in the creation of a blue ocean and a break\nfrom the competition. Importantly, value innovation defies one of\nthe most commonly accepted dogmas of competition-based strategy: the value-cost trade-off.20 It is conventionally believed that\ncompanies can either create greater value to customers at a higher\ncost or create reasonable value at a lower cost. Here strategy is\nseen as making a choice between differentiation and low cost.21 In\ncontrast, those that seek to create blue oceans pursue differentiation and low cost simultaneously.\nLet’s return to the example of Cirque du Soleil. Pursuing differentiation and low cost simultaneously lies at the heart of the entertainment experience it created. At the time of its debut, other\ncircuses focused on benchmarking one another and maximizing\ntheir share of already shrinking demand by tweaking traditional\ncircus acts. This included trying to secure more famous clowns and\nlion tamers, a strategy that raised circuses’ cost structure without\nsubstantially altering the circus experience. The result was rising\ncosts without rising revenues, and a downward spiral of overall circus demand.\nThese efforts were made irrelevant when Cirque du Soleil appeared. Neither an ordinary circus nor a classic theater production,\nCreating Blue Oceans 13\n\nCirque du Soleil paid no heed to what the competition did. Instead\nof following the conventional logic of outpacing the competition\nby offering a better solution to the given problem—creating a circus with even greater fun and thrills—it sought to offer people the\nfun and thrill of the circus and the intellectual sophistication and\nartistic richness of the theater at the same time; hence, it redefined\nthe problem itself.22 By breaking the market boundaries of theater\nand circus, Cirque du Soleil gained a new understanding not only\nof circus customers but also of circus noncustomers: adult theater\ncustomers.\nThis led to a whole new circus concept that broke the value-cost\ntrade-off and created a blue ocean of new market space. Consider\nthe differences. Whereas other circuses focused on offering animal\nshows, hiring star performers, presenting multiple show arenas in\nthe form of three rings, and pushing aisle concession sales, Cirque\ndu Soleil did away with all these factors. These factors had long\nbeen taken for granted in the traditional circus industry, which\nnever questioned their ongoing relevance. However, there was increasing public discomfort with the use of animals. Moreover, animal acts were one of the most expensive elements, including not\nonly the cost of the animals but also their training, medical care,\nhousing, insurance, and transportation.\nSimilarly, while the circus industry focused on featuring stars, in\nthe mind of the public the so-called stars of the circus were trivial\nnext to movie stars. Again, they were a high-cost component carrying little sway with spectators. Gone, too, are three-ring venues.\nNot only did this arrangement create angst among spectators as\nthey rapidly switched their gaze from one ring to the other, but it\nalso increased the number of performers needed, with obvious cost\nimplications. And although aisle concession sales appeared to be a\ngood way to generate revenue, in practice the high prices discouraged audiences from making purchases and made them feel they\nwere being taken for a ride.\nThe lasting allure of the traditional circus came down to only\nthree key factors: the tent, the clowns, and the classic acrobatic\n14 BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY\n\nacts such as the wheelman and short stunts. So Cirque du Soleil\nkept the clowns but shifted their humor from slapstick to a more enchanting, sophisticated style. It glamorized the tent, an element\nthat, ironically, many circuses had begun to forfeit in favor of\nrented venues. Seeing that this unique venue symbolically captured the magic of the circus, Cirque du Soleil designed the classic\nsymbol of the circus with a glorious external finish and a higher\nlevel of comfort, making its tents reminiscent of the grand epic circuses. Gone were the sawdust and hard benches. Acrobats and\nother thrilling acts are retained, but their roles were reduced and\nmade more elegant by the addition of artistic flair and intellectual\nwonder to the acts.\nBy looking across the market boundary of theater, Cirque du\nSoleil also offered new noncircus factors, such as a story line and,\nwith it, intellectual richness, artistic music and dance, and multiple\nproductions. These factors, entirely new creations for the circus industry, are drawn from the alternative live entertainment industry\nof theater.\nUnlike traditional circus shows having a series of unrelated\nacts, for example, each Cirque du Soleil creation has a theme and\nstory line, somewhat resembling a theater performance. Although\nthe theme is vague (and intentionally so), it brings harmony and an\nintellectual element to the show—without limiting the potential\nfor acts. Le Cirque also borrows ideas from Broadway shows. For\nexample, it features multiple productions rather than the traditional\n“one for all” shows. As with Broadway shows, too, each Cirque du\nSoleil show has an original score and assorted music, which drives\nthe visual performance, lighting, and timing of the acts rather than\nthe other way around. The shows feature abstract and spiritual\ndance, an idea derived from theater and ballet. By introducing\nthese new factors into its offering, Cirque du Soleil has created\nmore sophisticated shows.\nMoreover, by injecting the concept of multiple productions and\nby giving people a reason to come to the circus more frequently,\nCirque du Soleil has dramatically increased demand.\nCreating Blue Oceans 15\n\nIn short, Cirque du Soleil offers the best of both circus and theater,\nand it has eliminated or reduced everything else. By offering unprecedented utility, Cirque du Soleil has created a blue ocean and\nhas invented a new form of live entertainment, one that is markedly\ndifferent from both traditional circus and theater. At the same time,\nby eliminating many of the most costly elements of the circus, it has\ndramatically reduced its cost structure, achieving both differentiation and low cost. Le Cirque strategically priced its tickets against\nthose of the theater, lifting the price point of the circus industry by\nseveral multiples while still pricing its productions to capture the\nmass of adult customers, who were used to theater prices.\nFigure 1-2 depicts the differentiation–low cost dynamics underpinning value innovation.\n16 BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY\nFIGURE 1-2\nValue Innovation: The Cornerstone of Blue Ocean Strategy\nValue innovation is created in the region where a company’s actions favorably affect both\nits cost structure and its value proposition to buyers. Cost savings are made by eliminating\nand reducing the factors an industry competes on. Buyer value is lifted by raising and\ncreating elements the industry has never offered. Over time, costs are reduced further as\nscale economies kick in due to the high sales volumes that superior value generates.\nThe Simultaneous Pursuit of Differentiation and Low Cost\nValue\nInnovation\nCosts\nBuyer Value\n\nAs shown in figure 1-2, the creation of blue oceans is about driving costs down while simultaneously driving value up for buyers.\nThis is how a leap in value for both the company and its buyers is\nachieved. Because buyer value comes from the utility and price\nthat the company offers to buyers and because the value to the company is generated from price and its cost structure, value innovation is achieved only when the whole system of the company’s utility,\nprice, and cost activities is properly aligned. It is this whole-system\napproach that makes the creation of blue oceans a sustainable\nstrategy. Blue ocean strategy integrates the range of a firm’s functional and operational activities.\nIn contrast, innovations such as production innovations can be\nachieved at the subsystem level without impacting the company’s\noverall strategy. An innovation in the production process, for example, may lower a company’s cost structure to reinforce its existing\ncost leadership strategy without changing the utility proposition\nof its offering. Although innovations of this sort may help to secure\nand even lift a company’s position in the existing market space,\nsuch a subsystem approach will rarely create a blue ocean of new\nmarket space.\nIn this sense, value innovation is more than innovation. It is\nabout strategy that embraces the entire system of a company’s activities.23 Value innovation requires companies to orient the whole\nsystem toward achieving a leap in value for both buyers and themselves. Absent such an integral approach, innovation will remain\ndivided from the core of strategy.24 Figure 1-3 outlines the key\ndefining features of red and blue ocean strategies.\nCompetition-based red ocean strategy assumes that an industry’s structural conditions are given and that firms are forced to\ncompete within them, an assumption based on what the academics\ncall the structuralist view, or environmental determinism.\n25 In contrast, value innovation is based on the view that market boundaries\nand industry structure are not given and can be reconstructed\nby the actions and beliefs of industry players. We call this the\nCreating Blue Oceans 17\n\nreconstructionist view. In the red ocean, differentiation costs because firms compete with the same best-practice rule. Here, the\nstrategic choices for firms are to pursue either differentiation or\nlow cost. In the reconstructionist world, however, the strategic aim\nis to create new best-practice rules by breaking the existing valuecost trade-off and thereby creating a blue ocean. (For more discussions on this, see appendix B, “Value Innovation: A Reconstructionist View of Strategy.”)\nCirque du Soleil broke the best practice rule of the circus industry, achieving both differentiation and low cost by reconstructing\nelements across existing industry boundaries. Is Cirque du Soleil,\nthen, really a circus, with all that it eliminated, reduced, raised,\nand created? Or is it theater? And if it is theater, then what genre—\na Broadway show, an opera, a ballet? It is not clear. Cirque du Soleil\nreconstructed elements across these alternatives, and, in the end, it\nis simultaneously a little of all of them and none of any of them in\ntheir entirety. It created a blue ocean of new, uncontested market\nspace that as of yet has no agreed-on industry name.\n18 BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY\nFIGURE 1-3\nRed Ocean Versus Blue Ocean Strategy\nRed Ocean Strategy Blue Ocean Strategy\nCompete in existing market space.

How can companies systematically maximize the opportunities while simultaneously minimizing the risks of formulating and executing blue ocean strategy? If\nyou lack an understanding of the opportunity-maximizing and riskminimizing principles driving the creation and capture of blue oceans,\nthe odds will be lengthened against your blue ocean initiative.\nOf course, there is no such thing as a riskless strategy.27 Strategy\nwill always involve both opportunity and risk, be it a red ocean or a\nblue ocean initiative. But at present the playing field is dramatically unbalanced in favor of tools and analytical frameworks to\nsucceed in red oceans. As long as this remains true, red oceans will\ncontinue to dominate companies’ strategic agenda even as the business imperative for creating blue oceans takes on new urgency. Perhaps this explains why, despite prior calls for companies to go\nbeyond existing industry space, companies have yet to act seriously\non these recommendations.\nThis book seeks to address this imbalance by laying out a methodology to support our thesis. Here we present the principles and analytical frameworks to succeed in blue oceans.\nChapter 2 introduces the analytical tools and frameworks that\nare essential for creating and capturing blue oceans. Although\nsupplementary tools are introduced in other chapters as needed,\nthese basic analytics are used throughout the book. Companies\ncan make proactive changes in industry or market fundamentals\nthrough the purposeful application of these blue ocean tools and\nframeworks, which are grounded in the issues of both opportunity\nand risk. Subsequent chapters introduce the principles that drive\nCreating Blue Oceans 19\n\nthe successful formulation and implementation of blue ocean strategy and explain how they, along with the analytics, are applied in\naction.\nThere are four guiding principles for the successful formulation\nof blue ocean strategy. Chapters 3 to 6 address these in turn. Chapter 3 identifies the paths by which you can systematically create uncontested market space across diverse industry domains, hence\nattenuating search risk. It teaches you how to make the competition\nirrelevant by looking across the six conventional boundaries of\ncompetition to open up commercially important blue oceans. The\nsix paths focus on looking across alternative industries, across\nstrategic groups, across buyer groups, across complementary product and service offerings, across the functional-emotional orientation of an industry, and even across time.\nChapter 4 shows how to design a company’s strategic planning\nprocess to go beyond incremental improvements to create value innovations. It presents an alternative to the existing strategic planning process, which is often criticized as a number-crunching\nexercise that keeps companies locked into making incremental improvements. This principle tackles planning risk. Using a visualizing approach that drives you to focus on the big picture rather than\nto be submerged in numbers and jargon, this chapter proposes a\nfour-step planning process whereby you can build a strategy that\ncreates and captures blue ocean opportunities.\nChapter 5 shows how to maximize the size of a blue ocean. To\ncreate the greatest market of new demand, this chapter challenges\nthe conventional practice of aiming for finer segmentation to better meet existing customer preferences. This practice often results\nin increasingly small target markets. Instead, this chapter shows\nyou how to aggregate demand, not by focusing on the differences\nthat separate customers but by building on the powerful commonalities across noncustomers to maximize the size of the blue ocean\nbeing created and new demand being unlocked, hence minimizing\nscale risk.\n20 BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY\n\nChapter 6 lays out the design of a strategy that allows you not\nonly to provide a leap in value to the mass of buyers but also to\nbuild a viable business model to produce and maintain profitable\ngrowth for itself. It shows you how to ensure that your company\nbuilds a business model that profits from the blue ocean it is creating. It addresses business model risk. The chapter articulates the\nsequence in which you should create a strategy to ensure that\nboth you and your customers win as you create new business terrain. Such a strategy follows the sequence of utility, price, cost,\nand adoption.\nChapters 7 and 8 turn to the principles that drive effective execution of blue ocean strategy. Specifically, chapter 7 introduces what\nwe call tipping point leadership. Tipping point leadership shows\nmanagers how to mobilize an organization to overcome the key organizational hurdles that block the implementation of a blue ocean\nstrategy. It deals with organizational risk. It lays out how leaders\nand managers alike can surmount the cognitive, resource, motivational, and political hurdles in spite of limited time and resources\nin executing blue ocean strategy.\nChapter 8 argues for the integration of execution into strategy\nmaking, thus motivating people to act on and execute a blue ocean\nstrategy in a sustained way deep in an organization. This chapter\nCreating Blue Oceans 21\nFIGURE 1-4\nThe Six Principles of Blue Ocean Strategy\nFormulation principles Risk factor each principle attenuates\nReconstruct market boundaries ↓ Search risk\nFocus on the big picture, not the numbers ↓ Planning risk\nReach beyond existing demand ↓ Scale risk\nGet the strategic sequence right ↓ Business model risk\nExecution principles Risk factor each principle attenuates\nOvercome key organizational hurdles ↓ Organizational risk\nBuild execution into strategy ↓ Management risk\n\nintroduces what we call fair process. Because a blue ocean strategy\nperforce represents a departure from the status quo, this chapter\nshows how fair process facilitates both strategy making and execution by mobilizing people for the voluntary cooperation needed to\nexecute blue ocean strategy. It deals with management risk associated with people’s attitudes and behaviors.\nFigure 1-4 highlights the six principles driving the successful\nformulation and execution of blue ocean strategy and the risks that\nthese principles attenuate.\nChapter 9 discusses the dynamic aspects of blue ocean strategy—\nthe issues of sustainability and renewal.\nLet’s now move on to chapter 2, where we lay out the basic analytical tools and frameworks that will be used throughout this book\nin the formulation and execution of blue ocean strategy.\n22 BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY\n\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\nC HAPTER 2\nAnalytical Tools\nand Frameworks\nWE HAVE SPENT THE PAST DECADE developing a\nset of analytical tools and frameworks in an attempt\nto make the formulation and execution of blue ocean strategy as\nsystematic and actionable as competing in the red waters of known\nmarket space. These analytics fill a central void in the field of\nstrategy, which has developed an impressive array of tools and\nframeworks to compete in red oceans, such as the five forces for\nanalyzing existing industry conditions and three generic strategies, but has remained virtually silent on practical tools to excel in\nblue oceans. Instead, executives have received calls to be brave and\nentrepreneurial, to learn from failure, and to seek out revolutionaries. Although thought-provoking, these are not substitutes for\nanalytics to navigate successfully in blue waters. In the absence of\nanalytics, executives cannot be expected to act on the call to break\nout of existing competition. Effective blue ocean strategy should be\nabout risk minimization and not risk taking.\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n\nTo address this imbalance, we studied companies around the\nworld and developed practical methodologies in the quest of blue\noceans. We then applied and tested these tools and frameworks in\naction by working with companies in their pursuit of blue oceans,\nenriching and refining them in the process. The tools and frameworks presented here are used throughout this book as we discuss\nthe six principles of formulating and executing blue ocean strategy. As a brief introduction to these tools and frameworks, let’s\nlook at one industry—the U.S. wine industry—to see how these\ntools can be applied in practice in the creation of blue oceans.\nThe United States has the third largest aggregate consumption\nof wine worldwide. Yet the $20 billion industry is intensely competitive. California wines dominate the domestic market, capturing\ntwo-thirds of all U.S. wine sales. These wines compete head-to-head\nwith imported wines from France, Italy, and Spain and New World\nwines from countries such as Chile, Australia, and Argentina,\nwhich have increasingly targeted the U.S. market. With the supply\nof wines increasing from Oregon, Washington, and New York state\nand with newly mature vineyard plantings in California, the number\nof wines has exploded. Yet the U.S. consumer base has essentially\nremained stagnant. The United States remains stuck at thirty-first\nplace in world per capita wine consumption.\nThe intense competition has fueled ongoing industry consolidation. The top eight companies produce more than 75 percent of the\nwine in the United States, and the estimated one thousand six hundred other wineries produce the remaining 25 percent. The dominance of a few key players allows them to leverage distributors to\ngain shelf space and put millions of dollars into above-the-line marketing budgets. There is a simultaneous consolidation of retailers\nand distributors across the United States, something that raises\ntheir bargaining power against the plethora of wine makers. Titanic battles are being fought for retail and distribution space. It is\nno surprise that weak, poorly run companies are increasingly being\nswept aside. Downward pressure on wine prices has set in.\n24 BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY\n\nIn short, the U.S. wine industry faces intense competition,\nmounting price pressure, increasing bargaining power on the part\nof retail and distribution channels, and flat demand despite overwhelming choice. Following conventional strategic thinking, the\nindustry is hardly attractive. For strategists, the critical question\nis, How do you break out of this red ocean of bloody competition to\nmake the competition irrelevant? How do you open up and capture\na blue ocean of uncontested market space?\nTo address these questions, we turn to the strategy canvas, an\nanalytic framework that is central to value innovation and the creation of blue oceans.\nThe Strategy Canvas\nThe strategy canvas is both a diagnostic and an action framework\nfor building a compelling blue ocean strategy. It serves two purposes. First, it captures the current state of play in the known market space. This allows you to understand where the competition is\ncurrently investing, the factors the industry currently competes on\nin products, service, and delivery, and what customers receive from\nthe existing competitive offerings on the market. Figure 2-1 captures all this information in graphic form. The horizontal axis captures the range of factors the industry competes on and invests in.\nIn the case of the U.S. wine industry, there are seven principal\nfactors:\n• Price per bottle of wine\n• An elite, refined image in packaging, including labels announcing the wine medals won and the use of esoteric enological terminology to stress the art and science of wine making\n• Above-the-line marketing to raise consumer awareness in a\ncrowded market and to encourage distributors and retailers\nto give prominence to a particular wine house\nAnalytical Tools and Frameworks 25\n\n• Aging quality of wine\n• The prestige of a wine’s vineyard and its legacy (hence the\nappellations of estates and chateaux and references to the\nhistoric age of the establishment)\n• The complexity and sophistication of a wine’s taste, including such things as tannins and oak\n• A diverse range of wines to cover all varieties of grapes and\nconsumer preferences from Chardonnay to Merlot, and so on\nThese factors are viewed as key to the promotion of wine as a\nunique beverage for the informed wine drinker, worthy of special\noccasions.\nThat is the underlying structure of the U.S. wine industry from\nthe market perspective. Now let’s turn to the vertical axis of the\n26 BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY\nFIGURE 2-1\nThe Strategy Canvas of the U.S. Wine Industry in the Late 1990s\nPremium Wines\nHigh\nLow\nBudget Wines\nPrice Above-the-line Vineyard prestige Wine\nUse of enological marketing Aging and legacy Wine range\nterminology and quality complexity\ndistinctions in wine\ncommunication\n\nstrategy canvas, which captures the offering level that buyers receive across all these key competing factors. A high score means\nthat a company offers buyers more, and hence invests more, in that\nfactor. In the case of price, a higher score indicates a higher price.\nWe can now plot the current offering of wineries across all these\nfactors to understand wineries’ strategic profiles, or value curves.\nThe value curve, the basic component of the strategy canvas, is a\ngraphic depiction of a company’s relative performance across its\nindustry’s factors of competition.\nFigure 2-1 shows that, although more than one thousand six\nhundred wineries participate in the U.S. wine industry, from the\nbuyer’s point of view there is enormous convergence in their value\ncurves. Despite the plethora of competitors, when premium brand\nwines are plotted on the strategy canvas we discover that from the\nmarket point of view all of them essentially have the same strategic\nprofile. They offer a high price and present a high level of offering\nacross all the key competing factors. Their strategic profile follows\na classic differentiation strategy. From the market point of view,\nhowever, they are all different in the same way. On the other hand,\nbudget wines also have the same essential strategic profile. Their\nprice is low, as is their offering across all the key competing factors.\nThese are classic low-cost players. Moreover, the value curves of\npremium and low-cost wines share the same basic shape. The two\nstrategic groups’ strategies march in lockstep, but at different altitudes of offering level.\nTo set a company on a strong, profitable growth trajectory in the\nface of these industry conditions, it won’t work to benchmark competitors and try to outcompete them by offering a little more for a\nlittle less. Such a strategy may nudge sales up but will hardly drive\na company to open up uncontested market space. Nor is conducting\nextensive customer research the path to blue oceans. Our research\nfound that customers can scarcely imagine how to create uncontested\nmarket space. Their insight also tends toward the familiar “offer me\nmore for less.” And what customers typically want “more” of are those\nproduct and service features that the industry currently offers.\nAnalytical Tools and Frameworks 27\n\nTo fundamentally shift the strategy canvas of an industry, you\nmust begin by reorienting your strategic focus from competitors to\nalternatives, and from customers to noncustomers of the industry.1\nTo pursue both value and cost, you should resist the old logic of\nbenchmarking competitors in the existing field and choosing between differentiation and cost leadership. As you shift your strategic\nfocus from current competition to alternatives and noncustomers,\nyou gain insight into how to redefine the problem the industry focuses on and thereby reconstruct buyer value elements that reside\nacross industry boundaries. Conventional strategic logic, by contrast, drives you to offer better solutions than your rivals to existing problems defined by your industry.\nIn the case of the U.S. wine industry, conventional wisdom caused\nwineries to focus on overdelivering on prestige and the quality of\nwine at its price point. Overdelivery meant adding complexity to\nthe wine based on taste profiles shared by wine makers and reinforced by the wine show judging system. Wine makers, show judges,\nand knowledgeable drinkers concur that complexity—layered personality and characteristics that reflect the uniqueness of the soil,\nseason, and wine maker’s skill in tannins, oak, and aging processes—equates with quality.\nBy looking across alternatives, however, Casella Wines, an Australian winery, redefined the problem of the wine industry to a new\none: how to make a fun and nontraditional wine that’s easy to drink\nfor everyone. Why? In looking at the demand side of the alternatives of beer, spirits, and ready-to-drink cocktails, which captured three times as many U.S. consumer alcohol sales as wine,\nCasella Wines found that the mass of American adults saw wine as\na turnoff. It was intimidating and pretentious, and the complexity\nof wine’s taste created flavor challenges for the average person even\nthough it was the basis on which the industry fought to excel. With\nthis insight, Casella Wines was ready to explore how to redraw the\nstrategic profile of the U.S. wine industry to create a blue ocean. To\nachieve this, it turned to the second basic analytic underlying blue\noceans: the four actions framework.\n28 BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY\n\nThe Four Actions Framework\nTo reconstruct buyer value elements in crafting a new value curve,\nwe have developed the four actions framework. As shown in figure\n2-2, to break the trade-off between differentiation and low cost and\nto create a new value curve, there are four key questions to challenge an industry’s strategic logic and business model:\n• Which of the factors that the industry takes for granted\nshould be eliminated?\n• Which factors should be reduced well below the industry’s\nstandard?\n• Which factors should be raised well above the industry’s\nstandard?\n• Which factors should be created that the industry has never\noffered?\nAnalytical Tools and Frameworks 29\nFIGURE 2-2\nThe Four Actions Framework\nCreate\nWhich factors should\nbe created that\nthe industry has\nnever offered?\nReduce\nWhich factors should\nbe reduced well\nbelow the industry’s\nstandard?\nEliminate\nWhich of the factors\nthat the industry\ntakes for granted\nshould be eliminated?\nRaise\nWhich factors should\nbe raised well\nabove the industry’s\nstandard?\nA New\nValue\nCurve\n\nThe first question forces you to consider eliminating factors that\ncompanies in your industry have long competed on. Often those\nfactors are taken for granted even though they no longer have\nvalue or may even detract from value. Sometimes there is a fundamental change in what buyers value, but companies that are focused on benchmarking one another do not act on, or even perceive,\nthe change.\nThe second question forces you to determine whether products\nor services have been overdesigned in the race to match and beat\nthe competition. Here, companies overserve customers, increasing\ntheir cost structure for no gain.\nThe third question pushes you to uncover and eliminate the compromises your industry forces customers to make. The fourth question\nhelps you to discover entirely new sources of value for buyers and to\ncreate new demand and shift the strategic pricing of the industry.\nIt is by pursuing the first two questions (of eliminating and reducing) that you gain insight into how to drop your cost structure\nvis-à-vis competitors. Our research has found that rarely do managers systematically set out to eliminate and reduce their investments in factors that an industry competes on. The result is\nmounting cost structures and complex business models. The second two factors, by contrast, provide you with insight into how to\nlift buyer value and create new demand. Collectively, they allow\nyou to systematically explore how you can reconstruct buyer value\nelements across alternative industries to offer buyers an entirely\nnew experience, while simultaneously keeping your cost structure\nlow. Of particular importance are the actions of eliminating and\ncreating, which push companies to go beyond value maximization\nexercises with existing factors of competition. Eliminating and\ncreating prompt companies to change the factors themselves,\nhence making the existing rules of competition irrelevant.\nWhen you apply the four actions framework to the strategy canvas of your industry, you get a revealing new look at old perceived\ntruths. In the case of the U.S. wine industry, by thinking in terms of\nthese four actions vis-à-vis the current industry logic and looking\n30 BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY\n\nacross alternatives and noncustomers, Casella Wines created [yellow tail], a wine whose strategic profile broke from the competition\nand created a blue ocean. Instead of offering wine as wine, Casella\ncreated a social drink accessible to everyone: beer drinkers, cocktail drinkers, and other drinkers of nonwine beverages. In the space\nof two years, the fun, social drink [yellow tail] emerged as the\nfastest growing brand in the histories of both the Australian and\nthe U.S. wine industries and the number one imported wine into\nthe United States, surpassing the wines of France and Italy. By\nAugust 2003 it was the number one red wine in a 750-ml bottle sold\nin the United States, outstripping California labels. By mid-2003,\n[yellow tail]’s moving average annual sales were tracking at 4.5 million cases. In the context of a global wine glut, [yellow tail] has been\nracing to keep up with sales.\nWhat’s more, whereas large wine companies developed strong\nbrands over decades of marketing investment, [yellow tail] leapfrogged tall competitors with no promotional campaign, mass media,\nor consumer advertising. It didn’t simply steal sales from competitors; it grew the market. [yellow tail] brought nonwine drinkers—\nbeer and ready-to-drink cocktail consumers—into the wine market.\nMoreover, novice table wine drinkers started to drink wine more\nfrequently, jug wine drinkers moved up, and drinkers of more expensive wines moved down to become consumers of [yellow tail].\nFigure 2-3 shows the extent to which the application of these\nfour actions led to a break from the competition in the U.S. wine industry. Here we can graphically compare [yellow tail]’s blue ocean\nstrategy with the more than one thousand six hundred wineries\ncompeting in the United States. As shown in figure 2-3, [yellow\ntail]’s value curve stands apart. Casella Wines acted on all four actions—eliminate, reduce, raise, and create—to unlock uncontested\nmarket space that changed the face of the U.S. wine industry in a\nspan of two years.\nBy looking at the alternatives of beer and ready-to-drink cocktails and thinking in terms of noncustomers, Casella Wines created\nthree new factors in the U.S. wine industry—easy drinking, easy to\nAnalytical Tools and Frameworks 31\n\nselect, and fun and adventure—and eliminated or reduced everything else. Casella Wines found that the mass of Americans rejected\nwine because its complicated taste was difficult to appreciate.\nBeer and ready-to-drink cocktails, for example, were much sweeter\nand easier to drink. Accordingly, [yellow tail] was a completely\nnew combination of wine characteristics that produced an uncomplicated wine structure that was instantly appealing to the mass of\nalcohol drinkers. The wine was soft in taste and approachable like\nready-to-drink cocktails and beer, and had up-front, primary flavors and pronounced fruit flavors. The sweet fruitiness of the wine\nalso kept people’s palate fresher, allowing them to enjoy another\nglass of wine without thinking about it. The result was an easydrinking wine that did not require years to develop an appreciation for.\n32 BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY\nFIGURE 2-3\nThe Strategy Canvas of [yellow tail]\nPremium Wines\nHigh\nLow\nBudget Wines\nPrice Above-the-line Vineyard prestige Wine Ease of\nmarketing and legacy range selection\nUse of enological Aging Wine Easy Fun and\nterminology and quality complexity drinking adventure\ndistinctions in wine\ncommunication\n[yellow tail]\n\nIn line with this simple fruity sweetness, [yellow tail] dramatically reduced or eliminated all the factors the wine industry had\nlong competed on—tannins, oak, complexity, and aging—in crafting\nfine wine, whether it was for the premium or the budget segment.\nWith the need for aging eliminated, the needed working capital for\naging wine at Casella Wines was also reduced, creating a faster\npayback for the wine produced. The wine industry criticized the\nsweet fruitiness of [yellow tail] wine, seeing it as significantly lowering the quality of wine and working against proper appreciation\nof fine grapes and historic wine craftsmanship. These claims may\nhave been true, but customers of all sorts loved the wine.\nWine retailers in the United States offered buyers aisles of wine\nvarieties, but to the general consumer the choice was overwhelming and intimidating. The bottles looked the same, labels were complicated with enological terminology understandable only to the\nwine connoisseur or hobbyist, and the choice was so extensive that\nsalesclerks at retail shops were at an equal disadvantage in understanding or recommending wine to bewildered potential buyers.\nMoreover, the rows of wine choice fatigued and demotivated customers, making selection a difficult process that left the average\nwine purchaser insecure with the choice.\n[yellow tail] changed all that by creating ease of selection. It dramatically reduced the range of wines offered, creating only two:\nChardonnay, the most popular white in the United States, and a\nred, Shiraz. It removed all technical jargon from the bottles and\ncreated instead a striking, simple, and nontraditional label featuring a kangaroo in bright, vibrant colors of orange and yellow on a\nblack background. The wine boxes [yellow tail] came in were also of\nthe same vibrant colors, with the name [yellow tail] printed boldly\non the sides; the boxes served the dual purpose of acting as eyecatching, unintimidating displays for the wine.\n[yellow tail] hit a home run in ease of selection when it made retail shop employees the ambassadors of [yellow tail] by giving them\nAustralian outback clothing, including bushman’s hats and oilskin\nAnalytical Tools and Frameworks 33\n\njackets to wear at work. The retail employees were inspired by the\nbranded clothing and having a wine they themselves did not feel intimidated by, and recommendations to buy [yellow tail] flew out of\ntheir mouths. In short, it was fun to recommend [yellow tail].\nThe simplicity of offering only two wines at the start—a red and\na white—streamlined Casella Wines’ business model. Minimizing\nthe stockkeeping units maximized its stock turnover and minimized investment in warehouse inventory. In fact, this reduction of\nvariety was carried over to the bottles inside the cases. [yellow tail]\nbroke industry conventions. Casella Wines was the first company to\nput both red and white wine in the same-shaped bottle, a practice\nthat created further simplicity in manufacturing and purchasing\nand resulted in stunningly simple wine displays.\nThe wine industry worldwide was proud to promote wine as a refined beverage with a long history and tradition. This is reflected in\nthe target market for the United States: educated professionals in\nthe upper income brackets. Hence, the continuous focus on the\nquality and legacy of the vineyard, the chateau’s or estate’s historical tradition, and the wine medals won. Indeed the growth strategies of the major players in the U.S. wine industry were targeted at\nthe premium end of the market, with tens of millions invested in\nbrand advertising to strengthen this image. By looking to beer and\nready-to-drink cocktail customers, however, [yellow tail] found that\nthis elite image did not resonate with the general public, which\nfound it intimidating. So [yellow tail] broke with tradition and created a personality that embodied the characteristics of the Australian culture: bold, laid back, fun, and adventurous. Approachability was the mantra: “The essence of a great land . . . Australia.”\nThere was no traditional winery image. The lowercase spelling of\nthe name [yellow tail], coupled with the vibrant colors and the kangaroo motif, echoed Australia. And indeed no reference to the vineyard was made on the bottle. The wine promised to jump from the\nglass like an Aussie kangaroo.\nThe result is that [yellow tail] appealed to a broad cross section\nof alcohol beverage consumers. By offering this leap in value, [yel34 BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY\n\nlow tail] raised the price of its wines above the budget market, pricing them at $6.99 a bottle, more than double the price of a jug wine.\nFrom the moment the wine hit the retail shelves in July 2001, sales\ntook off.\nThe Eliminate-Reduce-Raise-Create Grid\nThere is a third tool that is key to creation of blue oceans. It is a\nsupplementary analytic to the four actions framework called the\neliminate-reduce-raise-create grid (see figure 2-4). The grid pushes\ncompanies not only to ask all four questions in the four actions\nframework but also to act on all four to create a new value curve. By\ndriving companies to fill in the grid with the actions of eliminating\nand reducing as well as raising and creating, the grid gives companies four immediate benefits:\n• It pushes them to simultaneously pursue differentiation and\nlow costs to break the value-cost trade-off.\nAnalytical Tools and Frameworks 35\nFIGURE 2-4\nEliminate-Reduce-Raise-Create Grid: The Case of [yellow tail]\nEliminate Raise\nEnological terminology Price versus\nand distinctions budget wines\nAging qualities Retail store\ninvolvement\nAbove-the-line marketing\nReduce Create\nWine complexity Easy drinking\nWine range Ease of selection\nVineyard prestige Fun and adventure\n\n• It immediately flags companies that are focused only on raising and creating and thereby lifting their cost structure and\noften overengineering products and services—a common\nplight in many companies.\n• It is easily understood by managers at any level, creating a\nhigh level of engagement in its application.\n• Because completing the grid is a challenging task, it drives\ncompanies to robustly scrutinize every factor the industry\ncompetes on, making them discover the range of implicit\nassumptions they make unconsciously in competing.\nFigure 2-5, the eliminate-reduce-raise-create grid for Cirque du\nSoleil, provides another snapshot of this tool in action and shows\nwhat it reveals. Worth noting is the range of factors that an industry has long competed on that companies discover can be eliminated and reduced. In the case of Cirque du Soleil, it eliminated\nseveral factors from traditional circuses, such as animal shows,\n36 BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY\nFIGURE 2-5\nEliminate-Reduce-Raise-Create Grid: The Case of Cirque du Soleil\nEliminate Raise\nStar performers Unique venue\nAnimal shows\nAisle concession sales\nMultiple show arenas\nReduce Create\nFun and humor Theme\nThrill and danger Refined environment\nMultiple productions\nArtistic music and dance\n\nstar performers, and multiple show arenas. These factors had long\nbeen taken for granted in the traditional circus industry, which\nnever questioned their ongoing relevance. However, there was increasing public discomfort with the use of animals. Moreover, animal acts are one of the most expensive elements; not only is there\nthe cost of the animals, but also their training, medical care, housing, insurance, and transportation. Similarly, although the circus\nindustry focused on featuring stars, in the mind of the public the\nso-called stars of the circus were trivial next to movie stars. Again,\nthey were a high-cost component carrying little sway with spectators. Gone, too, are three-ring venues. Not only did these create\nangst among spectators as they rapidly switched their gaze from\none ring to the other, but they also increased the number of performers needed, with the obvious cost implications.\nThree Characteristics of a Good Strategy\n[yellow tail], like Cirque du Soleil, created a unique and exceptional value curve to unlock a blue ocean. As shown in the strategy\ncanvas, [yellow tail]’s value curve has focus; the company does not\ndiffuse its efforts across all key factors of competition. The shape of\nits value curve diverges from the other players’, a result of not\nbenchmarking competitors but instead looking across alternatives.\nThe tagline of [yellow tail]’s strategic profile is clear: a fun and simple wine to be enjoyed every day.\nWhen expressed through a value curve, then, an effective blue\nocean strategy like [yellow tail]’s has three complementary qualities: focus, divergence, and a compelling tagline. Without these\nqualities, a company’s strategy will likely be muddled, undifferentiated, and hard to communicate with a high cost structure. The four\nactions of creating a new value curve should be well guided toward\nbuilding a company’s strategic profile with these characteristics.\nThese three characteristics serve as an initial litmus test of the\ncommercial viability of blue ocean ideas.\nAnalytical Tools and Frameworks 37\n\nA look at Southwest Airlines’ strategic profile illustrates how\nthese three qualities underlie the company’s effective strategy in\nreinventing the short-haul airline industry via value innovation\n(see figure 2-6). Southwest Airlines created a blue ocean by breaking the trade-offs customers had to make between the speed of airplanes and the economy and flexibility of car transport. To achieve\nthis, Southwest offered high-speed transport with frequent and flexible departures at prices attractive to the mass of buyers. By eliminating and reducing certain factors of competition and raising\nothers in the traditional airline industry, as well as by creating new\nfactors drawn from the alternative industry of car transport, Southwest Airlines was able to offer unprecedented utility for air travelers and achieve a leap in value with a low-cost business model.\nThe value curve of Southwest Airlines differs distinctively from\nthose of its competitors in the strategy canvas. Its strategic profile\nis a typical example of a compelling blue ocean strategy.\n38 BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY\nFIGURE 2-6\nThe Strategy Canvas of Southwest Airlines\nSouthwest\nHigh\nLow\nAverage Airlines\nPrice Lounges Hub Speed\nMeals Seating connectivity Friendly Frequent\nclass service point-tochoices point\ndepartures\nCar Transport\n\nFocus\nEvery great strategy has focus, and a company’s strategic profile, or\nvalue curve, should clearly show it. Looking at Southwest’s profile,\nwe can see at once that the company emphasizes only three factors:\nfriendly service, speed, and frequent point-to-point departures. By\nfocusing in this way, Southwest has been able to price against car\ntransportation; it doesn’t make extra investments in meals, lounges,\nand seating choices. By contrast, Southwest’s traditional competitors invest in all the airline industry’s competitive factors, making\nit much more difficult for them to match Southwest’s prices. Investing across the board, these companies let their competitors’ moves\nset their own agendas. Costly business models result.\nDivergence\nWhen a company’s strategy is formed reactively as it tries to keep\nup with the competition, it loses its uniqueness. Consider the similarities in most airlines’ meals and business-class lounges. On the\nstrategy canvas, therefore, reactive strategists tend to share the\nsame strategic profile. Indeed, in the case of Southwest, the value\ncurves of the company’s competitors are virtually identical and\ntherefore can be summarized on the strategy canvas with a single\nvalue curve.\nIn contrast, the value curves of blue ocean strategists always\nstand apart. By applying the four actions of eliminating, reducing,\nraising, and creating, they differentiate their profiles from the industry’s average profile. Southwest, for example, pioneered pointto-point travel between midsize cities; previously, the industry\noperated through hub-and-spoke systems.\nCompelling Tagline\nA good strategy has a clear-cut and compelling tagline. “The speed\nof a plane at the price of a car—whenever you need it.” That’s the\ntagline of Southwest Airlines, or at least it could be. What could\nAnalytical Tools and Frameworks 39\n\nSouthwest’s competitors say? Even the most proficient ad agency\nwould have difficulty reducing the conventional offering of lunches,\nseat choices, lounges, and hub links, with standard service, slower\nspeeds, and higher prices into a memorable tagline. A good tagline\nmust not only deliver a clear message but also advertise an offering\ntruthfully, or else customers will lose trust and interest. In fact, a\ngood way to test the effectiveness and strength of a strategy is to\nlook at whether it contains a strong and authentic tagline.\nAs shown in figure 2-7, Cirque du Soleil’s strategic profile also\nmeets the three criteria that define blue ocean strategy: focus, divergence, and a compelling tagline. Cirque du Soleil’s strategy\ncanvas allows us to graphically compare its strategic profile with\nthose of its major competitors. The canvas shows clearly the extent of Cirque du Soleil’s departure from the conventional logic of\nthe circus. The figure shows that the value curve of Ringling Bros.\nand Barnum & Bailey is the same basic shape as those of smaller\nregional circuses. The main difference is that regional circuses\n40 BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY\nFIGURE 2-7\nThe Strategy Canvas of Cirque du Soleil\nHigh\nLow\nRingling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Value Curve\nSmaller\nRegional\nCircuses\nCirque du Soleil\nValue Curve\nPrice Animal Multiple Thrills and Theme Multiple\nshows show danger productions\nStar Aisle arenas Fun Unique Refined Artistic\nperformers concessions and venue watching music\nhumor environment and dance\n\noffer less of each competing factor because of their restricted\nresources.\nBy contrast, Cirque du Soleil’s value curve stands apart. It has\nnew and noncircus factors such as theme, multiple productions, refined watching environment, and artistic music and dance. These\nfactors, entirely new creations for the circus industry, are drawn\nfrom the alternative live entertainment industry of theater. In this\nway, the strategy canvas clearly depicts the traditional factors that\naffect competition among industry players, as well as new factors\nthat lead to creation of new market space and that shift the strategy canvas of an industry.\n[yellow tail], Cirque du Soleil, and Southwest Airlines created\nblue oceans in very different business situations and industrial\ncontexts. However, their strategic profiles shared the same three\ncharacteristics: focus, divergence, and a compelling tagline. These\nthree criteria guide companies in carrying out the process of reconstruction to arrive at a breakthrough in value both for buyers\nand for themselves.\nReading the Value Curves\nThe strategy canvas enables companies to see the future in the present. To achieve this, companies must understand how to read value\ncurves. Embedded in the value curves of an industry is a wealth of\nstrategic knowledge on the current status and future of a business.\nA Blue Ocean Strategy\nThe first question the value curves answer is whether a business deserves to be a winner. When a company’s value curve, or its competitors’, meets the three criteria that define a good blue ocean\nstrategy—focus, divergence, and a compelling tagline that speaks to\nthe market—the company is on the right track. These three criteria\nserve as an initial litmus test of the commercial viability of blue\nocean ideas.\nAnalytical Tools and Frameworks 41\n\nOn the other hand, when a company’s value curve lacks focus, its\ncost structure will tend to be high and its business model complex\nin implementation and execution. When it lacks divergence, a company’s strategy is a me-too, with no reason to stand apart in the\nmarketplace. When it lacks a compelling tagline that speaks to buyers, it is likely to be internally driven or a classic example of innovation for innovation’s sake with no great commercial potential\nand no natural take-off capability.\nA Company Caught in the Red Ocean\nWhen a company’s value curve converges with its competitors, it\nsignals that a company is likely caught within the red ocean of\nbloody competition. A company’s explicit or implicit strategy tends\nto be trying to outdo its competition on the basis of cost or quality.\nThis signals slow growth unless, by the grace of luck, the company\nbenefits from being in an industry that is growing on its own accord. This growth is not due to a company’s strategy, however, but\nto luck.\nOverdelivery Without Payback\nWhen a company’s value curve on the strategy canvas is shown to\ndeliver high levels across all factors, the question is, Does the company’s market share and profitability reflect these investments? If\nnot, the strategy canvas signals that the company may be oversupplying its customers, offering too much of those elements that add\nincremental value to buyers. To value-innovate, the company must\ndecide which factors to eliminate and reduce—and not only those\nto raise and create—to construct a divergent value curve.\nAn Incoherent Strategy\nWhen a company’s value curve looks like a bowl of spaghetti—a\nzigzag with no rhyme or reason, where the offering can be described as “low-high-low-low-high-low-high”—it signals that the\n42 BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY\n\ncompany doesn’t have a coherent strategy. Its strategy is likely\nbased on independent substrategies. These may individually make\nsense and keep the business running and everyone busy, but collectively they do little to distinguish the company from the best\ncompetitor or to provide a clear strategic vision. This is often a reflection of an organization with divisional or functional silos.\nStrategic Contradictions\nAre there strategic contradictions? These are areas where a company is offering a high level on one competing factor while ignoring others that support that factor. An example is investing heavily\nin making a company’s Web site easy to use but failing to correct\nthe site’s slow speed of operation. Strategic inconsistencies can\nalso be found between the level of your offering and your price. For\nexample, a petroleum station company found that it offered “less\nfor more”: fewer services than the best competitor at a higher price.\nNo wonder it was losing market share fast.\nAn Internally Driven Company\nIn drawing the strategy canvas, how does a company label the industry’s competing factors? For example, does it use the word megahertz instead of speed, or thermal water temperature instead of hot\nwater? Are the competing factors stated in terms buyers can understand and value, or are they in operational jargon? The kind of language used in the strategy canvas gives insight as to whether a\ncompany’s strategic vision is built on an “outside-in” perspective,\ndriven by the demand side, or an “inside-out” perspective that is operationally driven. Analyzing the language of the strategy canvas\nhelps a company understand how far it is from creating industry\ndemand.\nThe tools and frameworks introduced here are essential analytics\nused throughout this book, and supplementary tools are introduced\nAnalytical Tools and Frameworks 43\n\nin other chapters as needed. It is the intersection between these\nanalytic techniques and the six principles of formulating and executing blue oceans that allow companies to break from the competition and unlock uncontested market space.\nNow we move on to the first principle, reconstructing market\nboundaries. In the next chapter we discuss the opportunity-maximizing and risk-minimizing paths to creating blue oceans.\n44 BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY\n\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\nPART TWO\nFormulating Blue\nOcean Strategy\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\nC HAPTER 3\nReconstruct Market Boundaries\nTHE FIR ST PRI NCIPLE of blue ocean strategy is to reconstruct market boundaries to break from the competition and create blue oceans. This principle addresses the search\nrisk many companies struggle with. The challenge is to successfully identify, out of the haystack of possibilities that exist, commercially compelling blue ocean opportunities. This challenge is\nkey because managers cannot afford to be riverboat gamblers betting their strategy on intuition or on a random drawing.\nIn conducting our research, we sought to discover whether there\nwere systematic patterns for reconstructing market boundaries to\ncreate blue oceans. And, if there were, we wanted to know whether\nthese patterns applied across all types of industry sectors—from\nconsumer goods, to industrial products, to finance and services, to\ntelecoms and IT, to pharmaceuticals and B2B—or were they limited to specific industries?\nWe found clear patterns for creating blue oceans. Specifically,\nwe found six basic approaches to remaking market boundaries. We\ncall this the six paths framework. These paths have general applicability across industry sectors, and they lead companies into the\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n\ncorridor of commercially viable blue ocean ideas. None of these\npaths requires special vision or foresight about the future. All are\nbased on looking at familiar data from a new perspective.\nThese paths challenge the six fundamental assumptions underlying many companies’ strategies. These six assumptions, on which\nmost companies hypnotically build their strategies, keep companies trapped competing in red oceans. Specifically, companies tend\nto do the following:\n• Define their industry similarly and focus on being the best\nwithin it\n• Look at their industries through the lens of generally accepted strategic groups (such as luxury automobiles, economy cars, and family vehicles), and strive to stand out in the\nstrategic group they play in\n• Focus on the same buyer group, be it the purchaser (as in the\noffice equipment industry), the user (as in the clothing industry), or the influencer (as in the pharmaceutical industry)\n• Define the scope of the products and services offered by their\nindustry similarly\n• Accept their industry’s functional or emotional orientation\n• Focus on the same point in time—and often on current competitive threats—in formulating strategy\nThe more that companies share this conventional wisdom\nabout how they compete, the greater the competitive convergence\namong them.\nTo break out of red oceans, companies must break out of the accepted boundaries that define how they compete. Instead of looking within these boundaries, managers need to look systematically\nacross them to create blue oceans. They need to look across alternative industries, across strategic groups, across buyer groups,\nacross complementary product and service offerings, across the\n48 FORMULATING BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY\n\nfunctional-emotional orientation of an industry, and even across\ntime. This gives companies keen insight into how to reconstruct\nmarket realities to open up blue oceans. Let’s examine how each of\nthese six paths works.\nPath 1: Look Across Alternative Industries\nIn the broadest sense, a company competes not only with the other\nfirms in its own industry but also with companies in those other industries that produce alternative products or services. Alternatives\nare broader than substitutes. Products or services that have different forms but offer the same functionality or core utility are often\nsubstitutes for each other. On the other hand, alternatives include\nproducts or services that have different functions and forms but the\nsame purpose.\nFor example, to sort out their personal finances, people can buy\nand install a financial software package, hire a CPA, or simply use\npencil and paper. The software, the CPA, and the pencil are largely\nsubstitutes for each other. They have very different forms but serve\nthe same function: helping people manage their financial affairs.\nIn contrast, products or services can take different forms and\nperform different functions but serve the same objective. Consider\ncinemas versus restaurants. Restaurants have few physical features in common with cinemas and serve a distinct function: They\nprovide conversational and gastronomical pleasure. This is a very\ndifferent experience from the visual entertainment offered by cinemas. Despite the differences in form and function, however, people\ngo to a restaurant for the same objective that they go to the movies:\nto enjoy a night out. These are not substitutes, but alternatives to\nchoose from.\nIn making every purchase decision, buyers implicitly weigh alternatives, often unconsciously. Do you need a self-indulgent two\nhours? What should you do to achieve it? Do you go to movie, have a\nmassage, or enjoy reading a favorite book at a local café? The\nReconstruct Market Boundaries 49\n\nthought process is intuitive for individual consumers and industrial buyers alike.\nFor some reason, we often abandon this intuitive thinking when\nwe become sellers. Rarely do sellers think consciously about how\ntheir customers make trade-offs across alternative industries. A\nshift in price, a change in model, even a new ad campaign can elicit\na tremendous response from rivals within an industry, but the same\nactions in an alternative industry usually go unnoticed. Trade journals, trade shows, and consumer rating reports reinforce the vertical walls between one industry and another. Often, however, the\nspace between alternative industries provides opportunities for\nvalue innovation.\nConsider NetJets, which created the blue ocean of fractional jet\nownership. In less than twenty years NetJets has grown larger than\nmany airlines, with more than five hundred aircraft, operating\nmore than two hundred fifty thousand flights to more than one hundred forty countries. Purchased by Berkshire Hathaway in 1998,\ntoday NetJets is a multibillion-dollar business, with revenues growing at 30–35 percent per year from 1993 to 2000. NetJets’ success\nhas been attributed to its flexibility, shortened travel time, hasslefree travel experience, increased reliability, and strategic pricing.\nThe reality is that NetJets reconstructed market boundaries to create this blue ocean by looking across alternative industries.\nThe most lucrative mass of customers in the aviation industry\nare corporate travelers. NetJets looked at the existing alternatives\nand found that when business travelers want to fly, they have two\nprincipal choices. On the one hand, a company’s executives can fly\nbusiness class or first class on a commercial airline. On the other\nhand, a company can purchase its own aircraft to serve its corporate travel needs. The strategic question is, Why would corporations choose one alternative industry over another? By focusing on\nthe key factors that lead corporations to trade across alternatives\nand eliminating or reducing everything else, NetJets created its\nblue ocean strategy.\nConsider this: Why do corporations choose to use commercial\nairlines for their corporate travel? Surely it’s not because of the\n50 FORMULATING BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY\n\nlong check-in and security lines, hectic flight transfers, overnight\nstays, or congested airports. Rather, they choose commercial airlines for only one reason: costs. On the one hand, commercial travel\navoids the high up-front, fixed-cost investment of a multimilliondollar jet aircraft. On the other hand, a company purchases only\nthe number of corporate airline tickets needed per year, lowering\nvariable costs and reducing the possibility of unused aviation\ntravel time that often accompanies the ownership of corporate jets.\nSo NetJets offers its customers one-sixteenth ownership of an\naircraft to be shared with fifteen other customers, each one entitled\nto fifty hours of flight time per year. Starting at $375,000 (plus pilot,\nmaintenance, and other monthly costs), owners can purchase a\nshare in a $6 million aircraft.1 Customers get the convenience of a\nprivate jet at the price of a commercial airline ticket. Comparing\nfirst-class travel with private aircraft, the National Business Aviation Association found that when direct and indirect costs—hotel,\nmeals, travel time, expenses—were factored in, the cost of firstclass commercial travel was significantly higher. In a cost-benefit\nanalysis for four passengers on a theoretical trip from Newark to\nAustin, the real cost of the commercial trip was $19,400, compared\nwith $10,100 in a private jet.2 As for NetJets, it avoids the enormous\nfixed costs that commercial airlines attempt to cover by filling larger\nand larger aircraft. NetJets’ smaller airplanes, the use of smaller\nregional airports, and limited staff keep costs to a minimum.\nTo understand the rest of the NetJets formula, consider the flip\nside: Why do people choose corporate jets over commercial travel?\nCertainly it is not to pay the multimillion-dollar price to purchase\nplanes. Nor is it to set up a dedicated flight department to take care\nof scheduling and other administrative matters. Nor it is to pay socalled deadhead costs—the costs of flying the aircraft from its\nhome base to where it is needed. Rather, corporations buy private\njets to dramatically cut total travel time, to reduce the hassle\nof congested airports, to allow for point-to-point travel, and to\ngain the benefit of having more productive and energized executives who can hit the ground running upon arrival. So NetJets built\non these distinctive strengths. Whereas 70 percent of commercial\nReconstruct Market Boundaries 51\n\nflights went to only thirty airports across the United States, NetJets offered access to more than five thousand five hundred airports\nacross the country, in convenient locations near business centers.\nOn international flights, your plane pulls directly up to the customs office.\nWith point-to-point service and the exponential increase in the\nnumber of airports to land in, there are no flight transfers; trips\nthat would otherwise require overnight stays can be completed in a\nsingle day. The time from your car to takeoff is measured in minutes instead of hours. For example, whereas a flight from Washington, D.C., to Sacramento would take 10.5 hours on a commercial\nairline, it is only 5.2 hours on a NetJets aircraft; from Palm Springs\nto Cabo San Lucas takes 6 hours commercial, and only 2.1 hours via\nNetJets.3 NetJets offers substantial cost savings in total travel time.\nPerhaps most appealing, your jet is always available with only\nfour hours’ notice. If a jet is not available, NetJets will charter one\nfor you. Last but not least, NetJets dramatically reduces issues related to security threats and offers clients customized in-flight service, such as having your favorite food and beverages ready for you\nwhen you board.\nBy offering the best of commercial travel and private jets and\neliminating and reducing everything else, NetJets opened up a\nmultibillion-dollar blue ocean wherein customers get the convenience and speed of a private jet with a low fixed cost and the low\nvariable cost of commercial airline travel (see figure 3-1). And the\ncompetition? According to NetJets, in the past seven years fiftyseven companies have set up fractional jet operations; of those,\nfifty-seven have gone out of business.\nThe biggest telecommunications success in Japan since the\n1980s also has its roots in path 1. Here we are speaking of NTT\nDoCoMo’s i-mode, which was launched in 1999. The i-mode service\nchanged the way people communicate and access information in\nJapan. NTT DoCoMo’s insight into creating a blue ocean came by\nthinking about why people trade-across the alternatives of mobile\nphones and the Internet. With deregulation of the Japanese tele52 FORMULATING BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY\n\ncommunications industry, new competitors were entering the market and price competition and technological races were the norm.\nThe result was that costs were rising while the average revenue per\nuser fell. NTT DoCoMo broke out of this red ocean of bloody competition by creating a blue ocean of wireless transmission not only\nof voice but also of text, data, and pictures.\nNTT DoCoMo asked, What are the distinctive strengths of the\nInternet over cell phones, and vice versa? Although the Internet offered endless information and services, the killer apps were e-mail,\nsimple information (such as news, weather forecasts, and a telephone directory), and entertainment (including games, events, and\nmusic entertainment). The key downside of the Internet was the far\nhigher price of computer hardware, an overload of information, the\nnuisance of dialing up to go online, and the fear of giving credit\nReconstruct Market Boundaries 53\nFIGURE 3-1\nThe Strategy Canvas of NetJets\nHigh\nLow\nPrice Need for Deadhead Speed of total Ease of travel Flexibility In-flight\ncustomers costs travel time (including and service\nto manage check-in, reliability\naircraft customs, etc.)\n(aircraft\nmanagement\nand administration)\nPrivate Jet\nCorporate travel\nNetJets’ Value Curve\nCommercial Airlines\nFirst- and business-class business travel\n(fixed\npurchase\n+ variable\nprice per\nflight)\n\ncard information electronically. On the other hand, the distinctive\nstrengths of mobile phones were their mobility, voice transmission,\nand ease of use.\nNTT DoCoMo broke the trade-off between these two alternatives, not by creating new technology but by focusing on the decisive advantages that the Internet has over the cell phone and vice\nversa. The company eliminated or reduced everything else. Its userfriendly interface has one simple button, the i-mode button (i standing for interactive, Internet, information, and the English pronoun\nI), which users press to give them immediate access to the few killer\napps of the Internet. Instead of barraging you with infinite information as on the Internet, however, the i-mode button acts as a\nhotel concierge service, connecting only to preselected and preapproved sites for the most popular Internet applications. That makes\nnavigation fast and easy. At the same time, even though the i-mode\nphone is priced 25 percent higher than a regular cell phone, the\nprice of the i-mode phone is dramatically less than that of a PC,\nand its mobility is high.\nMoreover, beyond adding voice, the i-mode uses a simple billing\nservice whereby all the services used on the Web via the i-mode are\nbilled to the user on the same monthly bill. This dramatically reduces the number of bills users receive and eliminates the need to\ngive credit card details, as on the Internet. And because the i-mode\nservice is automatically turned on whenever the phone is on, users\nare always connected and have no need to go through the hassle of\nlogging on.\nNeither the standard cell phone nor the PC could compete with\ni-mode’s divergent value curve. By the end of 2003 the number of\ni-mode subscribers had reached 40.1 million, and revenues from the\ntransmission of data, pictures, and text increased from 295 million\nyen ($2.6 million) in 1999 to 886.3 billion yen ($8 billion) in 2003.\nThe i-mode service did not simply win customers from competitors.\nIt dramatically grew the market, drawing in youth and senior citizens and converting voice-only customers to voice and data transmission customers.\n54 FORMULATING BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY\n\nIronically, European and U.S. counterparts who have been scrambling to unlock a similar blue ocean in the West have so far failed.\nWhy? Our assessment shows that they have been focused on delivering the most sophisticated technology, WAP (wireless application\nprotocol), instead of delivering exceptional value. This has led\nthem to build overcomplicated offerings that miss the key commonalities valued by the mass of people.\nMany other well-known success stories have looked across alternatives to create new markets. The Home Depot offers the expertise of\nprofessional home contractors at markedly lower prices than hardware stores. By delivering the decisive advantages of both alternative industries—and eliminating or reducing everything else—The\nHome Depot has transformed enormous latent demand for home\nimprovement into real demand, making ordinary homeowners into\ndo-it-yourselfers. Southwest Airlines concentrated on driving as the\nalternative to flying, providing the speed of air travel at the price of\ncar travel and creating the blue ocean of short-haul air travel. Similarly, Intuit looked to the pencil as the chief alternative to personal\nfinancial software to develop the fun and intuitive Quicken software.\nWhat are the alternative industries to your industry? Why do\ncustomers trade across them? By focusing on the key factors that\nlead buyers to trade across alternative industries and eliminating\nor reducing everything else, you can create a blue ocean of new\nmarket space.\nPath 2: Look Across Strategic\nGroups Within Industries\nJust as blue oceans can often be created by looking across alternative industries, so can they be unlocked by looking across strategic\ngroups. The term refers to a group of companies within an industry\nthat pursue a similar strategy. In most industries, the fundamental\nstrategic differences among industry players are captured by a small\nnumber of strategic groups.\nReconstruct Market Boundaries 55\n\nStrategic groups can generally be ranked in a rough hierarchical\norder built on two dimensions: price and performance. Each jump\nin price tends to bring a corresponding jump in some dimensions of\nperformance. Most companies focus on improving their competitive position within a strategic group. Mercedes, BMW, and Jaguar,\nfor example, focus on outcompeting one another in the luxury car\nsegment as economy car makers focus on excelling over one another in their strategic group. Neither strategic group, however,\npays much heed to what the other is doing because from a supply\npoint of view they do not seem to be competing.\nThe key to creating a blue ocean across existing strategic groups\nis to break out of this narrow tunnel vision by understanding\nwhich factors determine customers’ decisions to trade up or down\nfrom one group to another.\nConsider Curves, the Texas-based women’s fitness company.\nSince franchising began in 1995, Curves has grown like wildfire, acquiring more than two million members in more than six thousand\nlocations, with total revenues exceeding the $1 billion mark. A new\nCurves opens, on average, every four hours somewhere in the world.\nWhat’s more, this growth was triggered almost entirely through\nword of mouth and buddy referrals. Yet, at its inception, Curves\nwas seen as entering an oversaturated market, gearing its offering\nto customers who would not want it, and making its offering significantly blander than the competition’s. In reality, however, Curves\nexploded demand in the U.S. fitness industry, unlocking a huge untapped market, a veritable blue ocean of women struggling and failing to keep in shape through sound fitness. Curves built on the\ndecisive advantages of two strategic groups in the U.S. fitness industry—traditional health clubs and home exercise programs—\nand eliminated or reduced everything else.\nAt the one extreme, the U.S. fitness industry is awash with traditional health clubs that catered to both men and women, offering a\nfull range of exercise and sporting options, usually in upscale urban\nlocations. Their trendy facilities are designed to attract the high-end\nhealth club set. They have the full range of aerobic and strength\n56 FORMULATING BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY\n\ntraining machines, a juice bar, instructors, and a full locker room\nwith showers and sauna, because the aim is for customers to spend\nsocial as well as exercise time there. Having fought their way\nacross town to health clubs, customers typically spend at least an\nhour there, and more often two. Membership fees for all this are\ntypically in the range of $100 per month—not cheap, guaranteeing\nthat the market would stay upscale and small. Traditional health\nclub customers represent only 12 percent of the entire population,\nconcentrated overwhelmingly in the larger urban areas. Investment\ncosts for a traditional full-service health club run from $500,000 to\nmore than $1 million, depending on the city center location.\nAt the other extreme is the strategic group of home exercise programs, such as exercise videos, books, and magazines. These are a\nsmall fraction of the cost, are used at home, and generally require\nlittle or no exercise equipment. Instruction is minimal, being confined to the star of the exercise video or book and magazine explanations and illustrations.\nThe question is, What makes women trade either up or down between traditional health clubs and home exercise programs? Most\nwomen don’t trade up to health clubs for the profusion of special\nmachines, juice bars, locker rooms with sauna, pool, and the\nchance to meet men. The average female nonathlete does not even\nwant to run into men when she is working out, perhaps revealing\nlumps in her leotards. She is not inspired to line up behind machines in which she needs to change weights and adjust their incline angles. As for time, it has become an increasingly scarce\ncommodity for the average woman. Few can afford to spend one to\ntwo hours at a health club several times a week. For the mass of\nwomen, the city center locations also present traffic challenges,\nsomething that increases stress and discourages going to the gym.\nIt turns out that most women trade up to health clubs for one\nprincipal reason. When they are at home it’s too easy to find an excuse for not working out. It is hard to be disciplined in the confines\nof one’s home if you are not already a committed sports enthusiast.\nWorking out collectively, instead of alone, is more motivating and\nReconstruct Market Boundaries 57\n\ninspiring. Conversely, women who use home exercise programs do\nso primarily for the time saving, lower costs, and privacy.\nCurves built its blue ocean by drawing on the distinctive strengths\nof these two strategic groups, eliminating and reducing everything\nelse (see figure 3-2). Curves has eliminated all the aspects of the traditional health club that are of little interest to the broad mass of\nwomen. Gone are the profusion of special machines, food, spa, pool,\nand even locker rooms, which have been replaced by a few curtainedoff changing areas.\nThe experience in a Curves club is entirely different from that in\na typical health club. The member enters the exercise room where\nthe machines (typically about ten) are arranged, not in rows facing\na television as in the health club, but in a circle to facilitate interchange among members, making the experience fun. The QuickFit\ncircuit training system uses hydraulic exercise machines, which\nneed no adjusting, are safe, simple to use, and nonthreatening.\nSpecifically designed for women, these machines reduce impact\nstress and build strength and muscle. While exercising, members\ncan talk and support one another, and the social, nonjudgmental\natmosphere is totally different from that of a typical health club.\nThere are few if any mirrors on the wall, and there are no men staring at you. Members move around the circle of machines and aerobic pads and in thirty minutes complete the whole workout. The\nresult of reducing and focusing service on the essentials is that\nprices fall to around $30 per month, opening the market to the\nbroad mass of women. Curves’ tagline could be “for the price of a\ncup of coffee a day you can obtain the gift of health through proper\nexercise.”\nCurves offers the distinctive value depicted in figure 3-2 at a\nlower cost. Compared with the start-up investment of $500,000 to\n$1 million for traditional health clubs, start-up investments for\nCurves are in the range of only $25,000 to $30,000 (excluding a\n$20,000 franchise fee) because of the wide range of factors the company eliminated. Variable costs are also significantly lower, with\npersonnel and maintenance of facilities dramatically reduced and\n58 FORMULATING BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY\n\nrent reduced because of the much smaller spaces required: 1,500\nsquare feet in nonprime suburban locations versus 35,000 to 100,000\nsquare feet in prime urban locations. Curves’ low-cost business\nmodel makes its franchises easy to afford and helps explain why\nthey have mushroomed quickly. Most franchises are profitable\nwithin a few months, as soon as they recruit on average one hundred members. Established Curves franchises are selling in the\nrange of $100,000 to $150,000 on the secondary market.\nThe result is that Curves facilities are everywhere in most towns\nof any size. Curves is not competing directly with other health and\nexercise concepts; it created new blue ocean demand. As the\nUnited States and North America become saturated, management\nhas plans to expand into Europe. Expansion has already begun in\nLatin America and Spain. By the end of 2004, Curves is expected to\nreach eight thousand five hundred fitness centers.\nReconstruct Market Boundaries 59\nFIGURE 3-2\nThe Strategy Canvas of Curves\nHigh\nLow\nPrice Workout Availability of Nonthreatening Womanly\nequipment instructors same-sex fun\nAmenities (treadmills, Workout Environment environ- Conven- atmosweights, time encouraging ment ience phere\netc.) discipline\nand motivation\nin exercise\nCurves\nHome Exercise\nProgram\nTraditional\nHealth Clubs\n\nBeyond Curves, many companies have created blue oceans by\nlooking across strategic groups. Ralph Lauren created the blue\nocean of “high fashion with no fashion.” Its designer name, the elegance of its stores, and the luxury of its materials capture what\nmost customers value in haute couture. At the same time, its updated classical look and price capture the best of the classical lines\nsuch as Brooks Brothers and Burberry. By combining the most attractive factors of both groups and eliminating or reducing everything else, Polo Ralph Lauren not only captured share from both\nsegments but also drew many new customers into the market.\nIn the luxury car market, Toyota’s Lexus carved out a new blue\nocean by offering the quality of the high-end Mercedes, BMW, and\nJaguar at a price closer to the lower-end Cadillac and Lincoln. And\nthink of the Sony Walkman. By looking across the high fidelity of\nboom boxes with the low price and mobility of transistor radios\nwithin the audio equipment industry, Sony created the personal\nportable-stereo market in the late 1970s. The Walkman took share\nfrom these two strategic groups. In addition, its leap in value drew new\ncustomers, including joggers and commuters, into this blue ocean.\nMichigan-based Champion Enterprises identified a similar opportunity by looking across two strategic groups in the housing industry: makers of prefabricated housing and on-site developers.\nPrefabricated houses are cheap and quick to build, but they are\nalso dismally standardized and have a low-quality image. Houses\nbuilt by developers on-site offer variety and an image of high quality but are dramatically more expensive and take longer to build.\nChampion created a blue ocean by offering the decisive advantages of both strategic groups. Its prefabricated houses are quick to\nbuild and benefit from tremendous economies of scale and lower\ncosts, but Champion also allows buyers to choose such high-end finishing touches as fireplaces, skylights, and even vaulted ceilings to\ngive the homes a personal feel. In essence, Champion has changed\nthe definition of prefabricated housing. As a result, far more lowerto middle-income buyers have become interested in purchasing pre60 FORMULATING BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY\n\nfabricated housing rather than renting or buying an apartment,\nand even some affluent people are being drawn into the market.\nWhat are the strategic groups in your industry? Why do customers trade up for the higher group, and why do they trade down\nfor the lower one?\nPath 3: Look Across the Chain of Buyers\nIn most industries, competitors converge around a common definition of who the target buyer is. In reality, though, there is a chain of\n“buyers” who are directly or indirectly involved in the buying decision. The purchasers who pay for the product or service may differ\nfrom the actual users, and in some cases there are important influencers as well. Although these three groups may overlap, they often\ndiffer. When they do, they frequently hold different definitions of\nvalue. A corporate purchasing agent, for example, may be more concerned with costs than the corporate user, who is likely to be far\nmore concerned with ease of use. Similarly, a retailer may value a\nmanufacturer’s just-in-time stock replenishment and innovative financing. But consumer purchasers, although strongly influenced\nby the channel, do not value these things.\nIndividual companies in an industry often target different customer segments—for example, large versus small customers. But an\nindustry typically converges on a single buyer group. The pharmaceutical industry, for example, focuses overridingly on influencers:\ndoctors. The office equipment industry focuses heavily on purchasers: corporate purchasing departments. And the clothing industry sells predominantly to users. Sometimes there is a strong\neconomic rationale for this focus. But often it is the result of industry practices that have never been questioned.\nChallenging an industry’s conventional wisdom about which\nbuyer group to target can lead to the discovery of new blue ocean.\nBy looking across buyer groups, companies can gain new insights\nReconstruct Market Boundaries 61\n\ninto how to redesign their value curves to focus on a previously\noverlooked set of buyers.\nThink of Novo Nordisk, the Danish insulin producer that created a blue ocean in the insulin industry. Insulin is used by diabetics to regulate the level of sugar in their blood. Historically, the\ninsulin industry, like most of the pharmaceutical industry, focused\nits attention on the key influencers: doctors. The importance of\ndoctors in affecting the insulin purchasing decision of diabetics\nmade doctors the target buyer group of the industry. Accordingly,\nthe industry geared its attention and efforts to produce purer insulin in response to doctors’ quest for better medication. The issue\nwas that innovations in purification technology had improved dramatically by the early 1980s. As long as the purity of insulin was\nthe major parameter upon which companies competed, little\nprogress could be made further in that direction. Novo itself had\nalready created the first “human monocomponent” insulin that\nwas a chemically exact copy of human insulin. Competitive convergence among the major players was rapidly occurring.\nNovo Nordisk, however, saw that it could break away from the\ncompetition and create a blue ocean by shifting the industry’s longstanding focus on doctors to the users—patients themselves. In focusing on patients, Novo Nordisk found that insulin, which was\nsupplied to diabetes patients in vials, presented significant challenges in administering. Vials left the patient with the complex and\nunpleasant task of handling syringes, needles, and insulin, and\nof administering doses according to his or her needs. Needles and\nsyringes also evoked unpleasant feelings of social stigmatism for\npatients. And patients did not want to fiddle with syringes and needles outside their homes, a frequent occurrence because many patients must inject insulin several times a day.\nThis led Novo Nordisk to the blue ocean opportunity of NovoPen,\nlaunched in 1985. NovoPen, the first user-friendly insulin delivery\nsolution, was designed to remove the hassle and embarrassment of\nadministering insulin. The NovoPen resembled a fountain pen; it\ncontained an insulin cartridge that allowed the patient to easily\n62 FORMULATING BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY\n\ncarry, in one self-contained unit, roughly a week’s worth of insulin.\nThe pen had an integrated click mechanism, making it possible for\neven blind patients to control the dosing and administer insulin.\nPatients could take the pen with them and inject insulin with ease\nand convenience without the embarrassing complexity of syringes\nand needles.\nTo dominate the blue ocean it had unlocked, Novo Nordisk followed up by introducing, in 1989, NovoLet, a prefilled disposable insulin injection pen with a dosing system that provided users with\neven greater convenience and ease of use. And in 1999 it brought\nout the Innovo, an integrated electronic memory and cartridgebased delivery system. Innovo was designed to manage the delivery\nof insulin through built-in memory and to display the dose, the last\ndose, and the elapsed time—information that is critical for reducing risk and eliminating worries about missing a dose.\nNovo Nordisk’s blue ocean strategy shifted the industry landscape\nand transformed the company from an insulin producer to a diabetes care company. NovoPen and the later delivery systems swept\nover the insulin market. Sales of insulin in prefilled devices or pens\nnow account for the dominant share in Europe and Japan, where\npatients are advised to take frequent injections of insulin every day.\nAlthough Novo Nordisk itself has more than a 60 percent share in\nEurope and 80 percent in Japan, 70 percent of its total turnover\ncomes from diabetes care, an offering that originated largely in the\ncompany’s thinking in terms of users rather than influencers.\nSimilarly, consider Bloomberg. In a little more than a decade,\nBloomberg became one of the largest and most profitable businessinformation providers in the world. Until Bloomberg’s debut in the\nearly 1980s, Reuters and Telerate dominated the online financialinformation industry, providing news and prices in real time to the\nbrokerage and investment community. The industry focused on purchasers—IT managers—who valued standardized systems, which\nmade their lives easier.\nThis made no sense to Bloomberg. Traders and analysts, not IT\nmanagers, make or lose millions of dollars for their employers each\nReconstruct Market Boundaries 63\n\nday. Profit opportunities come from disparities in information.\nWhen markets are active, traders and analysts must make rapid decisions. Every second counts.\nSo Bloomberg designed a system specifically to offer traders better value, one with easy-to-use terminals and keyboards labeled\nwith familiar financial terms. The systems also have two flat-panel\nmonitors so that traders can see all the information they need at\nonce without having to open and close numerous windows. Because\ntraders must analyze information before they act, Bloomberg added\na built-in analytic capability that works with the press of a button.\nBefore, traders and analysts had to download data and use a pencil\nand calculators to perform important financial calculations. Now\nusers can quickly run “what if” scenarios to compute returns on alternative investments, and they can perform longitudinal analyses\nof historical data.\nBy focusing on users, Bloomberg was also able to see the paradox\nof traders’ and analysts’ personal lives. They have tremendous income but work such long hours that they have little time to spend\nit. Realizing that markets have slow times during the day when little trading takes place, Bloomberg decided to add information and\npurchasing services aimed at enhancing traders’ personal lives.\nTraders can use these services to buy items such as flowers, clothing, and jewelry; make travel arrangements; get information about\nwines; or search through real estate listings.\nBy shifting its focus upstream from purchasers to users, Bloomberg created a value curve that was radically different from anything the industry had seen before. The traders and analysts wielded\ntheir power within their firms to force IT managers to purchase\nBloomberg terminals.\nMany industries afford similar opportunities to create blue\noceans. By questioning conventional definitions of who can and\nshould be the target buyer, companies can often see fundamentally\nnew ways to unlock value. Consider how Canon copiers created the\nsmall desktop copier industry by shifting the target customer of\nthe copier industry from corporate purchasers to users. Or how\n64 FORMULATING BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY\n\nSAP shifted the customer focus of the business application software industry from the functional user to the corporate purchaser\nto create its enormously successful real-time integrated software\nbusiness.\nWhat is the chain of buyers in your industry? Which buyer group\ndoes your industry typically focus on? If you shifted the buyer\ngroup of your industry, how could you unlock new value?\nPath 4: Look Across Complementary\nProduct and Service Offerings\nFew products and services are used in a vacuum. In most cases,\nother products and services affect their value. But in most industries, rivals converge within the bounds of their industry’s product\nand service offerings. Take movie theaters. The ease and cost of\ngetting a babysitter and parking the car affect the perceived value\nof going to the movies. Yet these complementary services are beyond the bounds of the movie theater industry as it has been traditionally defined. Few cinema operators worry about how hard or\ncostly it is for people to get babysitters. But they should, because it\naffects demand for their business. Imagine a movie theater with a\nbabysitting service.\nUntapped value is often hidden in complementary products and\nservices. The key is to define the total solution buyers seek when\nthey choose a product or service. A simple way to do so is to think\nabout what happens before, during, and after your product is used.\nBabysitting and parking the car are needed before people can go to\nthe movies. Operating and application software are used along\nwith computer hardware. In the airline industry, ground transportation is used after the flight but is clearly part of what the customer needs to travel from one place to another.\nConsider NABI, a Hungarian bus company. It applied path 4 to\nthe $1 billion U.S. transit bus industry. The major customers in\nthe industry are public transport properties (PTPs), municipally\nReconstruct Market Boundaries 65\n\nowned transportation companies serving fixed-route public bus\ntransportation in major cities or counties.\nUnder the accepted rules of competition in the industry, companies competed to offer the lowest purchase price. Designs were outdated, delivery times were late, quality was low, and the price of\noptions was prohibitive given the industry’s penny-pinching approach. To NABI, however, none of this made sense. Why were bus\ncompanies focused only on the initial purchase price of the bus,\nwhen municipalities kept buses in circulation for twelve years on\naverage? When it framed the market in this way, NABI saw insights\nthat had escaped the entire industry.\nNABI discovered that the highest-cost element to municipalities\nwas not the price of the bus per se, the factor the whole industry\ncompeted on, but rather the costs that came after the bus was purchased: the maintenance of running the bus over its twelve-year\nlife cycle. Repairs after traffic accidents, fuel usage, wear and tear\non parts that frequently needed to be replaced due to the bus’s\nheavy weight, preventive body work to stop rusting, and the like—\nthese were the highest-cost factors to municipalities. With new demands for clean air being placed on municipalities, the cost for\npublic transport not being environmentally friendly was also beginning to be felt. Yet despite all these costs, which outstripped the\ninitial bus price, the industry had virtually overlooked the complementary activity of maintenance and life-cycle costs.\nThis made NABI realize that the transit bus industry did not\nhave to be a commodity-price-driven industry but that bus companies, focusing on selling buses at the lowest possible price, had\nmade it that way. By looking at the total solution of complementary activities, NABI created a bus unlike any the industry had\nseen before. Buses were normally made from steel, which was\nheavy, corrosive, and hard to repair after accidents because entire\npanels had to be replaced. NABI adopted fiberglass in making its\nbuses, a practice that killed five birds with one stone. Fiberglass\nbodies substantially cut the costs of preventive maintenance by\nbeing corrosion-free. It made body repairs faster, cheaper, and eas66 FORMULATING BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY\n\nier because fiberglass does not require panel replacements for\ndents and accidents; rather, damaged parts are simply cut out and\nnew fiberglass materials are easily soldered. At the same time, its\nlight weight (30–35 percent lighter than steel) cut fuel consumption\nand emissions substantially, making the buses more environmentally friendly. Moreover, its light weight allowed NABI to use not\nonly lower-powered engines but also fewer axles, resulting in lower\nmanufacturing costs and more space inside the bus.\nIn this way, NABI created a value curve that is radically divergent from the industry’s average curve. As you can see in figure 3-3,\nby building its buses in lightweight fiberglass, NABI eliminated or\nsignificantly reduced costs related to corrosion prevention, maintenance, and fuel consumption. As a result, even though NABI\ncharged a higher initial purchase price than the average price of\nthe industry, it offered its buses at a much lower life-cycle cost to\nmunicipalities. With much lighter emissions, the NABI buses\nReconstruct Market Boundaries 67\nFIGURE 3-3\nThe Strategy Canvas of the U.S. Municipal Bus Industry, Circa 2001\nHigh\nLow\nInitial Corrosion Maintenance Fuel Environmental Aesthetic Customer\npurchase cost consumption friendliness design friendliness\nprice\nNABI\nAverage U.S. Transit Bus\nLife-Cycle Costs\n\nraised the level of environmental friendliness high above the industry standard. Moreover, the higher price NABI charged allowed it\nto create factors unprecedented in the industry, such as modern\naesthetic design and customer friendliness, including lower floors\nfor easy mounting and more seats for less standing. These boosted\ndemand for transit bus service, generating more revenues for municipalities. NABI changed the way municipalities saw their revenues and costs involved in transit bus service. NABI created\nexceptional value for the buyers—in this case for both municipalities and end users—at a low life-cycle cost.\nNot surprisingly, both municipalities and riders loved the new\nbuses. NABI has captured 20 percent of the U.S. market since its inception in 1993, quickly vying for the number one slot in market\nshare, growth, and profitability. NABI, based in Hungary, created a\nblue ocean that made the competition irrelevant in the United\nStates, creating a win-win for all: itself, municipalities, and citizens. It has accumulated more than $1 billion in orders and was\nnamed by the Economist Intelligence Unit in October 2002 as one\nof the thirty most successful companies in the world.\nSimilarly, consider the British teakettle industry, which, despite\nits importance to British culture, had flat sales and shrinking profit\nmargins until Philips Electronics came along with a teakettle that\nturned the red ocean blue. By thinking in terms of complementary\nproducts and services, Philips saw that the biggest issue the British\nhad in brewing tea was not in the kettle itself but in the complementary product of water, which had to be boiled in the kettle. The\nissue was the lime scale found in tap water. The lime scale accumulated in kettles as the water was boiled, and later found its way into\nthe freshly brewed tea. The phlegmatic British typically took a teaspoon and went fishing to capture the off-putting lime scale before\ndrinking home-brewed tea. To the kettle industry, the water issue\nwas not its problem. It was the problem of another industry—the\npublic water supply.\nBy thinking in terms of solving the major pain points in customers’ total solution, Philips saw the water problem as its oppor68 FORMULATING BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY\n\ntunity. The result: Philips created a kettle having a mouth filter\nthat effectively captured the lime scale as the water was poured.\nLime scale would never again be found swimming in British homebrewed tea. The industry was again kick-started on a strong growth\ntrajectory as people began replacing their old kettles with the new\nfiltered kettles.\nThere are many other examples of companies that have followed\nthis path to create a blue ocean. Borders and Barnes & Noble\n(B&N) superstores redefined the scope of the services they offer.\nThey transformed the product they sell from the book itself into\nthe pleasure of reading and intellectual exploration, adding lounges,\nknowledgeable staff, and coffee bars to create an environment that\ncelebrates reading and learning. In less than six years, Borders and\nB&N emerged as the two largest bookstore chains in the United\nStates, with more than one thousand seventy superstores between\nthem. Virgin Entertainment’s megastores combine CDs, videos, computer games, and stereo and audio equipment to satisfy buyers’\ncomplete entertainment needs. Dyson designs its vacuum cleaners\nto eliminate the cost and annoyance of having to buy and change\nvacuum cleaner bags. Zeneca’s Salick cancer centers combine all\nthe cancer treatments their patients might need under one roof so\nthat they don’t have to go from one specialized center to another,\nmaking separate appointments for each service they require.\nWhat is the context in which your product or service is used?\nWhat happens before, during, and after? Can you identify the pain\npoints? How can you eliminate these pain points through a complementary product or service offering?\nPath 5: Look Across Functional or\nEmotional Appeal to Buyers\nCompetition in an industry tends to converge not only on an accepted notion of the scope of its products and services but also on\none of two possible bases of appeal. Some industries compete\nReconstruct Market Boundaries 69\n\nprincipally on price and function largely on calculations of utility;\ntheir appeal is rational. Other industries compete largely on feelings; their appeal is emotional.\nYet the appeal of most products or services is rarely intrinsically\none or the other. Rather it is usually a result of the way companies\nhave competed in the past, which has unconsciously educated consumers on what to expect. Companies’ behavior affects buyers’ expectations in a reinforcing cycle. Over time, functionally oriented\nindustries become more functionally oriented; emotionally oriented industries become more emotionally oriented. No wonder\nmarket research rarely reveals new insights into what attracts customers. Industries have trained customers in what to expect. When\nsurveyed, they echo back: more of the same for less.\nWhen companies are willing to challenge the functionalemotional orientation of their industry, they often find new market\nspace. We have observed two common patterns. Emotionally oriented\nindustries offer many extras that add price without enhancing functionality. Stripping away those extras may create a fundamentally\nsimpler, lower-priced, lower-cost business model that customers\nwould welcome. Conversely, functionally oriented industries can\noften infuse commodity products with new life by adding a dose of\nemotion and, in so doing, can stimulate new demand.\nTwo well-known examples are Swatch, which transformed the\nfunctionally driven budget watch industry into an emotionally\ndriven fashion statement, or The Body Shop, which did the reverse,\ntransforming the emotionally driven industry of cosmetics into a\nfunctional, no-nonsense cosmetics house. In addition, consider the\nexperience of QB (Quick Beauty) House. QB House created a blue\nocean in the Japanese barbershop industry and is rapidly growing\nthroughout Asia. Started in 1996 in Tokyo, QB House has blossomed from one outlet in 1996 to more than two hundred shops in\n2003. The number of visitors surged from 57,000 in 1996 to 3.5 million annually in 2002. The company is expanding in Singapore and\nMalaysia and is targeting one thousand outlets in Asia by 2013.\nAt the heart of QB House’s blue ocean strategy is a shift in the\nAsian barbershop industry from an emotional industry to a highly\n70 FORMULATING BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY\n\nfunctional one. In Japan the time it takes to get a man’s haircut\nhovers around one hour. Why? A long process of activities is undertaken to make the haircutting experience a ritual. Numerous hot\ntowels are applied, shoulders are rubbed and massaged, customers\nare served tea and coffee, and the barber follows a ritual in cutting\nhair, including special hair and skin treatments such as blow drying and shaving. The result is that the actual time spent cutting\nhair is a fraction of the total time. Moreover, these actions create a\nlong queue for other potential customers. The price of this haircutting process is 3,000 to 5,000 yen ($27 to $45).\nQB House changed all that. It recognized that many people, especially working professionals, do not wish to waste an hour on a\nhaircut. So QB House stripped away the emotional service elements of hot towels, shoulder rubs, and tea and coffee. It also dramatically reduced special hair treatments and focused mainly on\nbasic cuts. QB House then went one step further, eliminating the\ntraditional time-consuming wash-and-dry practice by creating the\n“air wash” system—an overhead hose that is pulled down to “vacuum” every cut-off hair. This new system works much better and\nfaster, without getting the customer’s head wet. These changes reduced the haircutting time from one hour to ten minutes. Moreover, outside each shop is a traffic light system that indicates when\na haircut slot is available. This removes waiting time uncertainty\nand eliminates the reservation desk.\nIn this way, QB House was able to reduce the price of a haircut to\n1,000 yen ($9) versus the industry average of 3,000 to 5,000 yen\n($27–$45) while raising the hourly revenue earned per barber nearly\n50 percent, with lower staff costs and less required retail space per\nbarber. QB House created this “no-nonsense” haircutting service\nwith improved hygiene. It introduced not only a sanitation facility\nset up for each chair but also a “one-use” policy, where every customer is provided with a new set of towel and comb. To appreciate\nits blue ocean creation, see figure 3-4.\nCemex, the world’s third-largest cement producer, is another\ncompany that created a blue ocean by shifting the orientation of its\nindustry—this time in the reverse direction, from functional to\nReconstruct Market Boundaries 71\n\nemotional. In Mexico, cement sold in retail bags to the average doit-yourselfer represents more than 85 percent of the total cement\nmarket.4 As it stood, however, the market was unattractive. There\nwere far more noncustomers than customers. Even though most\npoor families owned their own land and cement was sold as a relatively inexpensive functional input material, the Mexican population lived in chronic overcrowding. Few families built additions,\nand those that did took on average four to seven years to build only\none additional room. Why? Most of the families’ extra money was\nspent on village festivals, quinceañeras (girls’ fifteen-year birthday\nparties), baptisms, and weddings. Contributing to these important\nmilestone events was a chance to distinguish oneself in the community, whereas not contributing would be a sign of arrogance and\ndisrespect.\nAs a result, most of Mexico’s poor had insufficient and inconsistent savings to purchase building materials, even though having a\n72 FORMULATING BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY\nFIGURE 3-4\nThe Strategy Canvas of QB House\nHigh\nLow\nPrice Extra Hygiene Time savings\nReservation services Range of hair Time savings on haircut Highdesk (other than treatments on waiting performance\nhaircutting) “air wash”\nsystem\nQB House\nAverage Japanese Barbershop\n\ncement house was the stuff of dreams in Mexico. Cemex conservatively estimated that this market could grow to be worth $500 million to $600 million annually if it could unlock this latent demand.5\nCemex’s answer to this dilemma came in 1998 with its launch of\nthe Patrimonio Hoy program, which shifted the orientation of cement from a functional product to the gift of dreams. When people\nbought cement they were on the path to building rooms of love,\nwhere laughter and happiness could be shared—what better gift\ncould there be? At the foundation of Patrimonio Hoy was the traditional Mexican system of tandas, a traditional community savings\nscheme. In a tanda, ten individuals (for example) contribute 100\npesos per week for ten weeks. In the first week, lots are drawn to see\nwho “wins” the 1,000 pesos ($93) in each of the ten weeks. All participants win the 1,000 pesos one time only, but when they win, they\nreceive a large amount to make a large purchase.\nIn traditional tandas the “winning” family would spend the\nwindfall on an important festive or religious event such as a baptism or marriage. In the Patrimonio Hoy, however, the supertanda is\ndirected toward building room additions with cement. Think of it\nas a form of wedding registry, except that instead of giving, for example, silverware, Cemex positioned cement as a loving gift.\nThe Patrimonio Hoy building materials club that Cemex set up\nconsisted of a group of roughly seventy people contributing on average 120 pesos each week for seventy weeks. The winner of the supertanda each week, however, did not receive the total sum in pesos\nbut rather received the equivalent building materials to complete\nan entire new room. Cemex complemented the winnings with\nthe delivery of the cement to the winner’s home, construction\nclasses on how to effectively build rooms, and a technical adviser\nwho maintained a relationship with the participants during their\nproject.\nWhereas Cemex’s competitors sold bags of cement, Cemex was\nselling a dream, with a business model involving innovative financing and construction know-how. Cemex went a step further, throwing small festivities for the town when a room was finished and\nReconstruct Market Boundaries 73\n\nthereby reinforcing the happiness it brought to people and the\ntanda tradition.\nSince the company launched this new emotional orientation of\nCemex cement coupled with its funding and technical services,\ndemand for cement has soared. Around 20 percent more families\nare building additional rooms, and families are planning to build\ntwo to three more rooms than originally planned. In a market that\ncompeted on price with slow growth, Cemex enjoys 15 percent\nmonthly growth, selling its cement at higher prices (roughly 3.5\npesos). Cemex has so far tripled cement consumption by the mass of\ndo-it-yourself homebuilders—from 2,300 pounds consumed every\nfour years, on average, to the same amount being consumed in fifteen months. The predictability of the quantities of cement sold\nthrough the supertandas also drops Cemex’s cost structure via\nlower inventory costs, smoother production runs, and guaranteed\nsales that lower costs of capital. Social pressure makes defaults on\nsupertanda payments rare. Overall, Cemex created a blue ocean of\nemotional cement that achieved differentiation at a low cost.\nSimilarly, with its wildly successful Viagra, Pfizer shifted the\nfocus from medical treatment to lifestyle enhancement. Likewise,\nconsider how Starbucks turned the coffee industry on its head by\nshifting its focus from commodity coffee sales to the emotional atmosphere in which customers enjoy their coffee.\nA burst of blue ocean creation is under way in a number of service industries but in the opposite direction—moving from an emotional to a functional orientation. Relationship businesses, such as\ninsurance, banking, and investing, have relied heavily on the emotional bond between broker and client. They are ripe for change.\nDirect Line Group, a U.K. insurance company, for example, has done\naway with traditional brokers. It reasoned that customers would\nnot need the hand-holding and emotional comfort that brokers traditionally provide if the company did a better job of, for example, paying claims rapidly and eliminating complicated paperwork. So\ninstead of using brokers and regional branch offices, Direct Line\nuses information technology to improve claims handling, and it\n74 FORMULATING BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY\n\npasses on some of the cost savings to customers in the form of lower\ninsurance premiums. In the United States, The Vanguard Group (in\nindex funds) and Charles Schwab (in brokerage services) are doing\nthe same thing in the investment industry, creating a blue ocean by\ntransforming emotionally oriented businesses based on personal\nrelationships into high-performance, low-cost functional businesses.\nDoes your industry compete on functionality or emotional appeal? If you compete on emotional appeal, what elements can you\nstrip out to make it functional? If you compete on functionality,\nwhat elements can be added to make it emotional?\nPath 6: Look Across Time\nAll industries are subject to external trends that affect their businesses over time. Think of the rapid rise of the Internet or the\nglobal movement toward protecting the environment. Looking at\nthese trends with the right perspective can show you how to create\nblue ocean opportunities.\nMost companies adapt incrementally and somewhat passively as\nevents unfold. Whether it’s the emergence of new technologies or\nmajor regulatory changes, managers tend to focus on projecting\nthe trend itself. That is, they ask in which direction a technology\nwill evolve, how it will be adopted, whether it will become scalable.\nThey pace their own actions to keep up with the development of\nthe trends they’re tracking.\nBut key insights into blue ocean strategy rarely come from projecting the trend itself. Instead they arise from business insights\ninto how the trend will change value to customers and impact the\ncompany’s business model. By looking across time—from the value\na market delivers today to the value it might deliver tomorrow—\nmanagers can actively shape their future and lay claim to a new\nblue ocean. Looking across time is perhaps more difficult than the\nprevious approaches we’ve discussed, but it can be made subject to\nthe same disciplined approach. We’re not talking about predicting\nReconstruct Market Boundaries 75\n\nthe future, something that is inherently impossible. Rather, we’re\ntalking about finding insight in trends that are observable today.\nThree principles are critical to assessing trends across time. To\nform the basis of a blue ocean strategy, these trends must be decisive to your business, they must be irreversible, and they must have\na clear trajectory. Many trends can be observed at any one time—\nfor example, a discontinuity in technology, the rise of a new lifestyle, or a change in regulatory or social environments. But usually\nonly one or two will have a decisive impact on any particular business. And it may be possible to see a trend or major event without\nbeing able to predict its direction.\nIn 1998, for example, the mounting Asian crisis was an important\ntrend certain to have a big impact on financial services. But it was\nimpossible to predict the direction that trend would take, and\ntherefore it would have been a risky enterprise to envision a blue\nocean strategy that might result from it. In contrast, the euro has\nbeen evolving along a constant trajectory as it has been replacing\nEurope’s multiple currencies. It is a decisive, irreversible, and clearly\ndeveloping trend in financial services upon which blue oceans can\nbe created as the European Union continues to enlarge.\nHaving identified a trend of this nature, you can then look\nacross time and ask yourself what the market would look like if the\ntrend were taken to its logical conclusion. Working back from that\nvision of a blue ocean strategy, you can identify what must be\nchanged today to unlock a new blue ocean.\nFor example, Apple observed the flood of illegal music file sharing\nthat began in the late 1990s. Music file sharing programs such as\nNapster, Kazaa, and LimeWire had created a network of Internetsavvy music lovers freely, yet illegally, sharing music across the\nglobe. By 2003 more than two billion illegal music files were being\ntraded every month. While the recording industry fought to stop\nthe cannibalization of physical CDs, illegal digital music downloading continued to grow.\nWith the technology out there for anyone to digitally download\nmusic free instead of paying $19 for an average CD, the trend toward\n76 FORMULATING BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY\n\ndigital music was clear. This trend was underscored by the fastgrowing demand for MP3 players that played mobile digital music,\nsuch as Apple’s hit iPod. Apple capitalized on this decisive trend with\na clear trajectory by launching the iTunes online music store in 2003.\nIn agreement with five major music companies—BMG, EMI Group,\nSony, Universal Music Group, and Warner Brothers Records—iTunes\noffered legal, easy-to-use, and flexible à la carte song downloads.\niTunes allowed buyers to freely browse two hundred thousand\nsongs, listen to thirty-second samples, and download an individual\nsong for 99 cents or an entire album for $9.99. By allowing people\nto buy individual songs and strategically pricing them far more\nreasonably, iTunes broke a key customer annoyance factor: the\nneed to purchase an entire CD when they wanted only one or two\nsongs on it.\niTunes also leapt past free downloading services, providing\nsound quality as well as intuitive navigating, searching, and browsing functions. To illegally download music you must first search for\nthe song, album, or artist. If you are looking for a complete album\nyou must know the names of all the songs and their order. It is rare\nto find a complete album to download in one location. The sound\nquality is consistently poor because most people burn CDs at a low\nbit rate to save space. And most of the tracks available reflect the\ntastes of sixteen-year-olds, so although theoretically there are billions of tracks available, the scope is limited.\nIn contrast, Apple’s search and browsing functions are considered the best in the business. Moreover, iTunes music editors include a number of added features usually found in the record shops,\nincluding iTunes essentials such as Best Hair Bands or Best Love\nSongs, staff favorites, celebrity play lists, and Billboard charts.\nAnd the iTunes sound quality is the highest because iTunes encodes songs in a format called AAC, which offers sound quality superior to MP3s, even those burned at a very high data rate.\nCustomers have been flocking to iTunes, and recording companies and artists are also winning. Under iTunes they receive 65 percent of the purchase price of digitally downloaded songs, at last\nReconstruct Market Boundaries 77\n\nfinancially benefiting from the digital downloading craze. In addition, Apple further protected recording companies by devising\ncopyright protection that would not inconvenience users—who\nhad grown accustomed to the freedom of digital music in the postNapster world—but would satisfy the music industry. The iTunes\nMusic Store allows users to burn songs onto iPods and CDs up to\nseven times, enough to easily satisfy music lovers but far too few\ntimes to make professional piracy an issue.\nToday the iTunes Music Store offers more than 700,000 songs\nand has sold more than 70 million songs in its first year, with users\ndownloading on average 2.5 million per week. Nielsen//NetRatings\nestimates that the iTunes Music Store now accounts for 70 percent\nof the legal music download market. Apple’s iTunes is unlocking a\nblue ocean in digital music, with the added advantage of increasing\nthe attractiveness of its already hot iPod player. As other online\nmusic stores enter the fray, the challenge for Apple will be to keep\nits sights on the evolving mass market and not to fall into competitive benchmarking or high-end niche marketing.\nSimilarly, Cisco Systems created a new market space by thinking\nacross time trends. It started with a decisive and irreversible trend\nthat had a clear trajectory: the growing demand for high-speed data\nexchange. Cisco looked at the world as it was and concluded that\nthe world was hampered by slow data rates and incompatible computer networks. Demand was exploding as, among other factors,\nthe number of Internet users doubled roughly every one hundred\ndays. So Cisco could clearly see that the problem would inevitably\nworsen. Cisco’s routers, switches, and other networking devices\nwere designed to create breakthrough value for customers, offering\nfast data exchanges in a seamless networking environment. Thus\nCisco’s insight is as much about value innovation as it is about\ntechnology. Today more than 80 percent of all traffic on the Internet goes through Cisco’s products, and its gross margins in this\nnew market space have been in the 60 percent range.\nSimilarly, a host of other companies are creating blue oceans by\napplying path 6. Consider how CNN created the first real-time\n78 FORMULATING BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY\n\ntwenty-four-hour global news network based on the rising tide of\nglobalization. Or how HBO’s hit show Sex and the City acted on the\ntrend of increasingly urban and successful women who struggle to\nfind love and marry later in life.\nWhat trends have a high probability of impacting your industry,\nare irreversible, and are evolving in a clear trajectory? How will\nthese trends impact your industry? Given this, how can you open up\nunprecedented customer utility?\nConceiving New Market Space\nBy thinking across conventional boundaries of competition, you\ncan see how to make convention-altering, strategic moves that reconstruct established market boundaries and create blue oceans.\nThe process of discovering and creating blue oceans is not about\npredicting or preempting industry trends. Nor is it a trial-and-error\nprocess of implementing wild new business ideas that happen to\nReconstruct Market Boundaries 79\nFIGURE 3-5\nFrom Head-to-Head Competition to Blue Ocean Creation\nHead-to-Head Competition Blue Ocean Creation\nIndustry Focuses on rivals within Looks across alternative\nits industry industries\nStrategic group Focuses on competitive position Looks across strategic\nwithin strategic group groups within industry\nBuyer group Focuses on better serving the Redefines the industry\nbuyer group buyer group\nScope of product Focuses on maximizing the Looks across to\nor service offering value of product and service complementary product\nofferings within the bounds and service offerings\nof its industry\nFunctional- Focuses on improving price Rethinks the functionalemotional performance within the emotional orientation of\norientation functional-emotional orientation its industry\nof its industry\nTime Focuses on adapting to external Participates in shaping\ntrends as they occur external trends over time\n\ncome across managers’ minds or intuition. Rather, managers are\nengaged in a structured process of reordering market realities in a\nfundamentally new way. Through reconstructing existing market\nelements across industry and market boundaries, they will be able\nto free themselves from head-to-head competition in the red ocean.\nFigure 3-5 summarizes the six-path framework.\nWe are now ready to move on to building your strategy planning\nprocess around these six paths. We next look at how you reframe\nyour strategy planning process to focus on the big picture and\napply these ideas in formulating your own blue ocean strategy.\n80 FORMULATING BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY\n\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\nC HAPTER 4\nFocus on the Big Picture,\nNot the Numbers\nY OU NOW KNOW THE PATHS to creating blue oceans.\nThe next question is, How do you align your strategic\nplanning process to focus on the big picture and apply these ideas\nin drawing your company’s strategy canvas to arrive at a blue ocean\nstrategy? This is no small challenge. Our research reveals that most\ncompanies’ strategic planning process keeps them wedded to red\noceans. The process tends to drive companies to compete within existing market space.\nThink of a typical strategic plan. It starts with a lengthy description of current industry conditions and the competitive situation. Next is a discussion of how to increase market share, capture\nnew segments, or cut costs, followed by an outline of numerous\ngoals and initiatives. A full budget is almost invariably attached, as\nare lavish graphs and a surfeit of spreadsheets. The process usually\nculminates in the preparation of a large document culled from a\nmishmash of data provided by people from various parts of the organization who often have conflicting agendas and poor communication. In this process, managers spend the majority of strategic\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n\nthinking time filling in boxes and running numbers instead of\nthinking outside the box and developing a clear picture of how to\nbreak from the competition. If you ask companies to present their\nproposed strategies in no more than a few slides, it is not surprising\nthat few clear or compelling strategies are articulated.\nIt’s no wonder that few strategic plans lead to the creation of\nblue oceans or are translated into action. Executives are paralyzed\nby the muddle. Few employees deep down in the company even\nknow what the strategy is. And a closer look reveals that most\nplans don’t contain a strategy at all but rather a smorgasbord of\ntactics that individually make sense but collectively don’t add up to\na unified, clear direction that sets a company apart—let alone\nmakes the competition irrelevant. Does this sound like the strategic plans in your company?\nThis brings us to the second principle of blue ocean strategy:\nFocus on the big picture, not the numbers. This principle is key to\nmitigating the planning risk of investing lots of effort and lots of\ntime but delivering only tactical red ocean moves. Here we develop\nan alternative approach to the existing strategic planning process\nthat is based not on preparing a document but on drawing a strategy canvas.1 This approach consistently produces strategies that\nunlock the creativity of a wide range of people within an organization, open companies’ eyes to blue oceans, and are easy to understand and communicate for effective execution.\nFocusing on the Big Picture\nIn our research and consulting work, we have found that drawing a\nstrategy canvas not only visualizes a company’s current strategic\nposition in its marketplace but also helps it chart its future strategy. By building a company’s strategic planning process around a\nstrategy canvas, a company and its managers focus their main attention on the big picture rather than becoming immersed in numbers and jargon and getting caught up in operational details.2\n82 FORMULATING BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY\n\nAs previous chapters reveal, drawing a strategy canvas does\nthree things. First, it shows the strategic profile of an industry by\ndepicting very clearly the factors (and the possible future factors)\nthat affect competition among industry players. Second, it shows\nthe strategic profile of current and potential competitors, identifying which factors they invest in strategically. Finally, it shows the\ncompany’s strategic profile—or value curve—depicting how it invests in the factors of competition and how it might invest in them\nin the future. As discussed in chapter 2, the strategic profile with\nhigh blue ocean potential has three complementary qualities:\nfocus, divergence, and a compelling tagline. If a company’s strategic profile does not clearly reveal those qualities, its strategy will\nlikely be muddled, undifferentiated, and hard to communicate. It is\nalso likely to be costly to execute.\nDrawing Your Strategy Canvas\nDrawing a strategy canvas is never easy. Even identifying the key\nfactors of competition is far from straightforward. As you will see,\nthe final list is usually very different from the first draft.\nAssessing to what extent your company and its competitors offer\nthe various competitive factors is equally challenging. Most managers have a strong impression of how they and their competitors\nfare along one or two dimensions within their own scope of responsibility, but very few can see the overall dynamics of their industry.\nThe catering manager of an airline, for example, will be highly sensitive to how the airline compares in terms of refreshments. But\nthat focus makes consistent measurement difficult; what seems to\nbe a very big difference to the catering manager may not be important to customers, who look at the complete offering. Some managers will define the competitive factors according to internal\nbenefits. For example, a CIO might prize the company’s IT infrastructure for its data-mining capacity, a feature lost on most customers, who are more concerned with speed and ease of use.\nFocus on the Big Picture, Not the Numbers 83\n\nOver the past ten years, we have developed a structured process\nfor drawing and discussing a strategy canvas that pushes a company’s strategy toward a blue ocean. A 150-year-old financial services group that we’ll call European Financial Services (EFS) is one\nof the companies that adopted this process to develop a strategy\nthat breaks away from the competition. The resulting EFS strategy\nyielded a 30 percent revenue boost in its initial year. The process,\nwhich builds on the six paths of creating blue oceans and involves a\nlot of visual stimulation in order to unlock people’s creativity, has\nfour major steps (see figure 4-1).\nStep 1: Visual Awakening\nA common mistake is to discuss changes in strategy before resolving differences of opinion about the current state of play. Another\nproblem is that executives are often reluctant to accept the need for\nchange; they may have a vested interest in the status quo, or they\nmay feel that time will eventually vindicate their previous choices.\n84 FORMULATING BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY\nFIGURE 4-1\nThe Four Steps of Visualizing Strategy\n1.

It serves as a forceful wake-up call for companies to challenge their existing strategies. That was the experience at EFS,\nwhich had been struggling for a long time with an ill-defined and\npoorly communicated strategy. The company was also deeply divided. The top executives of EFS’s regional subsidiaries bitterly resented what they saw as the arrogance of the corporate executives,\nwhose philosophy, they believed, was essentially “nuts in the field,\nbrains in the center.” That conflict made it all the more difficult for\nEFS to come to grips with its strategic problems. Yet before the firm\ncould chart a new strategy, it was essential that it reach a common\nunderstanding of its current position.\nEFS began the strategy process by bringing together more than\ntwenty senior managers from subsidiaries in Europe, North America, Asia, and Australia and splitting them into two teams. One\nteam was responsible for producing a value curve depicting EFS’s\ncurrent strategic profile in its traditional corporate foreign exchange business relative to its competitors. The other team was\ncharged with the same task for EFS’s emerging online foreign exchange business. They were given ninety minutes, because if EFS\nhad a clear strategy, surely it would emerge quickly.\nIt was a painful experience. Both teams had heated debates\nabout what constituted a competitive factor and what the factors\nwere. Different factors were important, it seemed, in different regions and even for different customer segments. For example, Europeans argued that in its traditional business, EFS had to offer\nconsulting services on risk management, given the perceived riskaverse nature of its customers. Americans, however, dismissed that\nas largely irrelevant. They stressed the value of speed and ease of use.\nMany people had pet ideas of which they were the sole champions.\nOne person in the online team argued, for example, that customers\nFocus on the Big Picture, Not the Numbers 85\n\nwould be drawn in by the promise of instant confirmations of their\ntransactions—a service no one else thought necessary.\nDespite these difficulties, the teams completed their assignments and presented their pictures in a general meeting of all participants. Their results are shown in figures 4-2 and 4-3.\nThe pictures clearly revealed defects in the company’s strategy.\nEFS’s traditional and online value curves both demonstrated a serious lack of focus; the company was investing in diverse and numerous factors in both businesses. What’s more, EFS’s two curves\nwere very similar to those of competitors. Not surprisingly, neither\nteam could come up with a memorable tagline that was true to the\nteam’s value curve.\nThe pictures also highlighted contradictions. The online business, for example, had invested heavily in making the Web site easy\nto use—it had even won awards for this—but it became apparent\n86 FORMULATING BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY\nFIGURE 4-2\nThe Strategy Canvas of Corporate Foreign Exchange, Offline\nHigh\nLow\nPrice Corporate Speed Ease Knowledge\ndealers of use\nRisk Flexible Relationship Responsiveness\nmanagement payment terms management\nconsultancy\nEFS and Its\nNonbank Competitors\nBanks\n\nthat speed had been overlooked. EFS had one of the slowest Web\nsites in the business, and that might explain why such a wellregarded site did a relatively poor job of attracting customers and\nconverting them into sales.\nThe sharpest shocks, perhaps, came from comparing EFS’s strategy with its competitors’. The online group realized that its strongest\ncompetitor, which we’ve called Clearskies, had a focused, original,\nand easily communicable strategy: “One-click E-Z FX.” Clearskies,\nwhich was growing rapidly, was swimming away from the red ocean.\nFaced with direct evidence of the company’s shortcomings,\nEFS’s executives could not defend what they had shown to be a\nweak, unoriginal, and poorly communicated strategy. Trying to\ndraw the strategy canvases had made a stronger case for change\nthan any argument based on numbers and words could have done.\nThis created a strong desire in top management to seriously rethink the company’s current strategy.\nFocus on the Big Picture, Not the Numbers 87\nFIGURE 4-3\nThe Strategy Canvas of Corporate Foreign Exchange, Online\nHigh\nLow\nPrice Real-time Web site Ease Security\nrates attractiveness of use\nElectronic data Customer Speed Accuracy\ninterchange support\nEFS Online\nClearskies\nOther Online\nCompetitors\n\nStep 2: Visual Exploration\nGetting the wake-up call is only the first step. The next step is to\nsend a team into the field, putting managers face-to-face with what\nthey must make sense of: how people use or don’t use their products\nor services. This step may seem obvious, but we have found that\nmanagers often outsource this part of the strategy-making process.\nThey rely on reports that other people (often at one or two removes\nfrom the world they report on) have put together.\nA company should never outsource its eyes. There is simply no\nsubstitute for seeing for yourself. Great artists don’t paint from\nother people’s descriptions or even from photographs; they like to\nsee the subject for themselves. The same is true for great strategists. Michael Bloomberg, before becoming mayor of New York\nCity, was hailed as a business visionary for his realization that the\nproviders of financial information also needed to provide online\nanalytics to help users make sense of the data. But he would be the\nfirst to tell you that the idea should have been obvious to anyone\nwho had ever watched traders using Reuters or Dow Jones Telerate.\nBefore Bloomberg, traders used paper, pencil, and handheld calculators to write down price quotes and figure fair market values before making buy and sell decisions, a practice that cost them time\nand money as well as built-in errors.\nGreat strategic insights like this are less the product of genius\nthan of getting into the field and challenging the boundaries of\ncompetition.3 In the case of Bloomberg, his insight came by switching the focus of the industry from IT purchasers to users: the traders\nand analysts. This allowed him to see what was invisible to others.4\nObviously, the first port of call should be the customers. But you\nshould not stop there. You should also go after noncustomers.5 And\nwhen the customer is not the same as the user, you need to extend\nyour observations to the users, as Bloomberg did. You should not\nonly talk to these people but also watch them in action. Identifying\nthe array of complementary products and services that are consumed alongside your own may give you insight into bundling op88 FORMULATING BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY\n\nportunities. For example, parents who go to the movies will engage\na babysitter for the night. As the European cinema operator Kinepolis discovered, adding on-site childcare services helped fill European cinemas. Finally, you need to look at how customers might find\nalternative ways of fulfilling the need that your product or service\nsatisfies. For example, driving is an alternative to flying, so you\nshould also examine its distinct advantages and characteristics.\nEFS sent its managers into the field for four weeks to explore the\nsix paths to creating blue oceans.6 In this process, each was to interview and observe ten people involved in corporate foreign exchange,\nincluding lost customers, new customers, and the customers of\nEFS’s competitors and alternatives. The managers also reached\noutside the industry’s traditional boundaries to companies that did\nnot yet use corporate foreign exchange services but that might in\nthe future, such as Internet-based companies with a global reach\nlike Amazon.com. They interviewed the end users of corporate foreign exchange services—the accounting and treasury departments\nof companies. And finally, they looked at ancillary products and\nservices that their customers used—in particular, treasury management and pricing simulations.\nThe field research overturned many of the conclusions managers\nhad reached in the first step of the strategy creation process. For\nexample, account relationship managers, whom nearly everyone\nhad agreed were a key to success and on whom EFS prided itself,\nturned out to be the company’s Achilles’ heel. Customers hated\nwasting time dealing with relationship managers. To buyers, relationship managers were seen as relationship savers because EFS\nfailed to deliver on its promises.\nTo everyone’s astonishment, the factor customers valued most\nwas getting speedy confirmation of transactions, which only one\nmanager had previously suggested was important. The EFS managers saw that their customers’ accounting department personnel\nspent a lot of time making phone calls to confirm that payments\nhad been made and to check when they would be received. Customers received numerous calls on the same subject, and the time\nFocus on the Big Picture, Not the Numbers 89\n\nwasted in handling them was compounded by the necessity of making further calls to the foreign exchange provider, namely EFS or a\ncompetitor.\nEFS’s teams were then sent back to the drawing board. This time,\nthough, they had to propose a new strategy. Each team had to draw six\nnew value curves using the six path framework explained in chapter\n3. Each new value curve had to depict a strategy that would make\nthe company stand out in its market. By demanding six pictures from\neach team, we hoped to push managers to create innovative proposals and break the boundaries of their conventional thinking.\nFor each visual strategy, the teams also had to write a compelling tagline that captured the essence of the strategy and spoke\ndirectly to buyers. Suggestions included “Leave It to Us,” “Make\nMe Smarter,” and “Transactions in Trust.” A strong sense of competition developed between the two teams, making the process fun,\nimbuing it with energy, and driving the teams to develop blue ocean\nstrategies.\nStep 3: Visual Strategy Fair\nAfter two weeks of drawing and redrawing, the teams presented\ntheir strategy canvases at what we call a visual strategy fair. Attendees included senior corporate executives but consisted mainly of\nrepresentatives of EFS’s external constituencies—the kinds of people the managers had met with during their field trips, including\nnoncustomers, customers of competitors, and some of the most demanding EFS customers. In two hours, the teams presented all\ntwelve curves—six by the online group, and six by the offline group.\nThey were given no more than ten minutes to present each curve, on\nthe theory that any idea that takes more than ten minutes to communicate is probably too complicated to be any good. The pictures\nwere hung on the walls so that the audience could easily see them.\nAfter the twelve strategies were presented, each judge—an invited attendee—was given five sticky notes and told to put them\nnext to his or her favorites. The judges could put all five on a single\n90 FORMULATING BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY\n\nstrategy if they found it that compelling. The transparency and immediacy of this approach freed it from the politics that sometimes\nseem endemic to the strategic planning process. Managers had to\nrely on the originality and clarity of their curves and their pitches.\nOne began, for example, with the line, “We’ve got a strategy so cunning that you won’t be our customers, you’ll be our fans.”\nAfter the notes were posted, the judges were asked to explain\ntheir picks, adding another level of feedback to the strategy-making\nprocess. Judges were also asked to explain why they did not vote for\nthe other value curves.\nAs the teams synthesized the judges’ common likes and dislikes,\nthey realized that fully one-third of what they had thought were key\ncompetitive factors were, in fact, marginal to customers. Another\none-third either were not well articulated or had been overlooked\nin the visual awakening phase. It was clear that the executives\nneeded to reassess some long-held assumptions, such as EFS’s separation of its online and traditional businesses.\nThey also learned that buyers from all markets had a basic set of\nneeds and expected similar services. If you met those common\nneeds, customers would happily forgo everything else. Regional differences became significant only when there was a problem with\nthe basics. This was news to many people who had claimed that\ntheir regions were unique.\nFollowing the strategy fair, the teams were finally able to complete their mission. They were able to draw a value curve that was a\ntruer likeness of the existing strategic profile than anything they\nhad produced earlier, in part because the new picture ignored the\nspecious distinction that EFS had made between its online and offline businesses. More important, the managers were now in a position to draw a future strategy that would be distinctive as well as\nspeak to a true but hidden need in the marketplace. Figure 4-4 highlights the stark differences between the company’s current and future strategies.\nAs the figure shows, EFS’s future strategy eliminated relationship management and reduced investment in account executives,\nFocus on the Big Picture, Not the Numbers 91\n\nwho, from this point on, were assigned only to “AAA” accounts.\nThese moves dramatically reduced EFS’s costs because relationship managers and account executives were the highest-cost element of its business. EFS’s future strategy emphasized ease of use,\nsecurity, accuracy, and speed. These factors would be delivered\nthrough computerization, which would allow customers to input\ndata directly instead of having to send a fax to EFS.\nThis action would also free up corporate dealers’ time, a large\nportion of which had been spent completing paperwork and correcting errors. Dealers would now be able to provide richer market\ncommentary, a key success factor. Using the Internet, EFS would\nsend automatic confirmations to all customers. And it would offer a\npayment-tracking service, just as FedEx and UPS do for parcels.\nThe foreign exchange industry had never offered these services before. Figure 4-5 summarizes EFS’s four actions to create value innovation, the cornerstone of blue ocean strategy.\n92 FORMULATING BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY\nFIGURE 4-4\nEFS: Before and After\nHigh\nLow\nPrice Account Ease Accuracy Market Tracking\nexecutives of use commentary\nRelationship Corporate Security Speed Confirmation\nmanagement dealers\nEFS’s “After” Strategy\nEFS and Other Traditional\nCompetitors’ “Before” Strategy\n\nThe new value curve exhibited the criteria of a successful strategy. It displayed more focus than the previous strategy; investments\nthat were made were given a much stronger commitment than before. It also stood apart from the industry’s existing me-too curves\nand lent itself to a compelling tagline: “The FedEx of corporate foreign exchange: easy, reliable, fast, and trackable.” By collapsing its\nonline and traditional businesses into one compelling offering,\nEFS substantially cut the operational complexity of its business\nmodel, making systematic execution far easier.\nStep 4: Visual Communication\nAfter the future strategy is set, the last step is to communicate it in\na way that can be easily understood by any employee. EFS distributed the one-page picture showing its new and old strategic profiles\nso that every employee could see where the company stood and\nwhere it had to focus its efforts to create a compelling future. The\nsenior managers who participated in developing the strategy held\nFocus on the Big Picture, Not the Numbers 93\nFIGURE 4-5\nEliminate-Reduce-Raise-Create Grid: The Case of EFS\nEliminate Raise\nRelationship management Ease of use\nSecurity\nAccuracy\nSpeed\nMarket commentary\nReduce Create\nAccount executives Confirmation\nCorporate dealers Tracking\n\nmeetings with their direct reports to walk them through the picture, explaining what needed to be eliminated, reduced, raised, and\ncreated to pursue a blue ocean. Those people passed the message on\nto their direct reports. Employees were so motivated by the clear\ngame plan that many pinned up a version of the picture in their\ncubicles as a reminder of EFS’s new priorities and the gaps that\nneeded to be closed.\nThe new picture became a reference point for all investment decisions. Only those ideas that would help EFS move from the old to\nthe new value curve were given the go-ahead. When, for example,\nregional offices requested that the IT department add links on the\nWeb site—something that in the past would have been agreed to\nwithout debate—IT asked them to explain how the new links helped\nmove EFS toward its new profile. If the regional offices couldn’t\nprovide an explanation, the request was denied, thereby promoting\nclarity and not confusion on the Web site. Similarly, when the IT department pitched a multimillion-dollar back-office system to top\nmanagement, the system’s ability to meet the new value curve’s\nstrategic needs was the chief metric by which it was judged.\nVisualizing Strategy at the Corporate Level\nVisualizing strategy can also greatly inform the dialogue among individual business units and the corporate center in transforming a\ncompany from a red ocean to a blue ocean player. When business\nunits present their strategy canvases to one another, they deepen\ntheir understanding of the other businesses in the corporate portfolio. Moreover, the process also fosters the transfer of strategic\nbest practices across units.\nUsing the Strategy Canvas\nTo see how this works, consider how Samsung Electronics of Korea\nused strategy canvases at its 2000 corporate conference, which was\n94 FORMULATING BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY\n\nattended by more than seventy top managers, including the CEO.\nUnit heads presented their canvases and implementation plans to\nsenior executives and to one another. Discussions were heated, and a\nnumber of unit heads argued that the freedom of their units to form\nfuture strategies was constrained by the degree of competition they\nfaced. Poor performers felt that they had little choice but to match\ntheir competitors’ offerings. That hypothesis proved to be false when\none of the fastest-growing units—the mobile phone business—presented its strategy canvas. Not only did the unit have a distinctive\nvalue curve, but it also faced the most intense competition.\nSamsung Electronics has institutionalized the use of the strategy canvas in its key business creation decisions by establishing\nthe Value Innovation Program (VIP) Center in 1998. Core crossfunctional team members of its various business units come together in the VIP Center to discuss their strategic projects. These\ndiscussions typically focus on strategy canvases.\nWith the value innovation knowledge it has developed, the center, equipped with twenty project rooms, assists the units in making their product and service offering decisions. In 2003, the center\ncompleted more than eighty strategic projects and opened more\nthan ten VIP branches to meet business units’ rising demands.

At this conference, Samsung’s hit Value Innovation\nprojects are shared through presentations and exhibitions, and\nawards are given to the best cases. This is one way that Samsung\nElectronics establishes a common language system, instilling a corporate culture and strategic norms that drive its corporate business\nportfolio from red to blue oceans.7\nDo your business unit heads lack an understanding of the other\nbusinesses in your corporate portfolio? Are your strategic best\nFocus on the Big Picture, Not the Numbers 95\n\npractices poorly communicated across your business units? Are\nyour low-performing units quick to blame their competitive situations for their results? If the answer to any of these questions is\nyes, try drawing, and then sharing, the strategy canvases of your\nbusiness units.\nUsing the Pioneer-Migrator-Settler (PMS) Map\nVisualizing strategy can also help managers responsible for corporate strategy predict and plan the company’s future growth and\nprofit. All the companies that created blue oceans in our study have\nbeen pioneers in their industries, not necessarily in developing\nnew technologies but in pushing the value they offer customers to\nnew frontiers. Extending the pioneer metaphor can provide a useful way of talking about the growth potential of current and future\nbusinesses.\nA company’s pioneers are the businesses that offer unprecedented value. These are your blue ocean strategists, and they are\nthe most powerful sources of profitable growth. These businesses\nhave a mass following of customers. Their value curve diverges\nfrom the competition on the strategy canvas. At the other extreme\nare settlers—businesses whose value curves conform to the basic\nshape of the industry’s. These are me-too businesses. Settlers will\nnot generally contribute much to a company’s future growth. They\nare stuck within the red ocean.\nThe potential of migrators lies somewhere in between. Such\nbusinesses extend the industry’s curve by giving customers more\nfor less, but they don’t alter its basic shape. These businesses offer\nimproved value, but not innovative value. These are businesses\nwhose strategies fall on the margin between red oceans and blue\noceans.\nA useful exercise for a corporate management team pursuing\nprofitable growth is to plot the company’s current and planned\nportfolios on a pioneer-migrator-settler (PMS) map. For the purpose\nof the exercise, settlers are defined as me-too businesses, migrators\n96 FORMULATING BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY\n\nare business offerings better than most in the marketplace, and pioneers are the only ones with a mass following of customers.\nIf both the current portfolio and the planned offerings consist\nmainly of settlers, the company has a low growth trajectory, is\nlargely confined to red oceans, and needs to push for value innovation. Although the company might be profitable today as its settlers\nare still making money, it may well have fallen into the trap of competitive benchmarking, imitation, and intense price competition.\nIf current and planned offerings consist of a lot of migrators,\nreasonable growth can be expected. But the company is not exploiting its potential for growth, and it risks being marginalized by a\ncompany that value-innovates. In our experience the more an industry is populated by settlers, the greater is the opportunity to\nvalue-innovate and create a blue ocean of new market space.\nThis exercise is especially valuable for managers who want to see\nbeyond today’s performance. Revenue, profitability, market share,\nand customer satisfaction are all measures of a company’s current\nposition. Contrary to what conventional strategic thinking suggests, those measures cannot point the way to the future; changes\nin the environment are too rapid. Today’s market share is a reflection of how well a business has performed historically. Think of the\nstrategic reversal and market share upset that occurred when CNN\nentered the U.S. news market. ABC, CBS, and NBC—all with historically strong market shares—were devastated.\nChief executives should instead use value and innovation as the\nimportant parameters for managing their portfolio of businesses.\nThey should use innovation because, without it, companies are\nstuck in the trap of competitive improvements. They should use\nvalue because innovative ideas will be profitable only if they are\nlinked to what buyers are willing to pay for.\nClearly, what senior executives should be doing is getting their\norganizations to shift the balance of their future portfolio toward\npioneers. That is the path to profitable growth. The PMS map\nshown in figure 4-6 depicts this trajectory, showing the scatter\nplot of a company’s portfolio of businesses, where the gravity of\nFocus on the Big Picture, Not the Numbers 97\n\nits current portfolio of twelve businesses, expressed as twelve dots,\nshifts from a preponderance of settlers to a stronger balance of migrators and pioneers.\nIn pushing their businesses toward pioneers, however, senior executives should be well aware that even though settlers have marginal growth potential, they are frequently today’s cash generators.\nOn the other hand, pioneers have maximum growth potential but\noften consume cash at the outset as they grow and expand. Evidently, senior managers’ goal here should be to manage their portfolio of businesses to wisely balance between profitable growth and\ncash flow at a given point in time.\nOvercoming the Limitations\nof Strategic Planning\nManagers often express discontent, either explicitly or implicitly,\nwith existing strategic planning—the core activity of strategy. To\n98 FORMULATING BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY\nFIGURE 4-6\nTesting the Growth Potential of a Portfolio of Businesses\nPioneers\nMigrators\nSettlers\nToday Tomorrow\n\nthem, strategic planning should be more about collective wisdom\nbuilding than top-down or bottom-up planning. They think that it\nshould be more conversational than solely documentation-driven,\nand it should be more about building the big picture than about\nnumber-crunching exercises. It should have a creative component\ninstead of being strictly analysis-driven, and it should be more motivational, invoking willing commitment, than bargaining-driven,\nproducing negotiated commitment. Despite this appetite for change,\nhowever, scant work exists on building a viable alternative to existing strategic planning, which is the most essential management\ntask in the sense that almost every company in the world not only\ndoes it but often takes several grueling months each year to complete the exercise.\nBuilding the process around a picture addresses many of managers’ discontents with existing strategic planning and yields much\nbetter results. As Aristotle pointed out, “The soul never thinks without an image.”\nDrawing a strategy canvas and a PMS map is not, of course, the\nonly part of the strategic planning process. At some stage, numbers\nand documents must be compiled and discussed. But we believe\nthat the details will fall into place more easily if managers start\nwith the big picture of how to break away from the competition.\nThe methods of visualizing strategy proposed here will put strategy back into strategic planning, and they will greatly improve\nyour chances of creating a blue ocean.\nHow do you maximize the size of the blue ocean you are creating? The following chapter addresses that precise question.\nFocus on the Big Picture, Not the Numbers 99\n\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\nC HAPTER 5\nReach Beyond Existing Demand\nNO COMPANY WANTS to venture beyond red oceans\nonly to find itself in a puddle. The question is, How do\nyou maximize the size of the blue ocean you are creating? This\nbrings us to the third principle of blue ocean strategy: Reach beyond existing demand. This is a key component of achieving value\ninnovation. By aggregating the greatest demand for a new offering,\nthis approach attenuates the scale risk associated with creating a\nnew market.\nTo achieve this, companies should challenge two conventional\nstrategy practices. One is the focus on existing customers. The\nother is the drive for finer segmentation to accommodate buyer differences. Typically, to grow their share of a market, companies\nstrive to retain and expand existing customers. This often leads to\nfiner segmentation and greater tailoring of offerings to better meet\ncustomer preferences. The more intense the competition is, the\ngreater, on average, is the resulting customization of offerings. As\ncompanies compete to embrace customer preferences through finer\nsegmentation, they often risk creating too-small target markets.\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n\nTo maximize the size of their blue oceans, companies need to\ntake a reverse course. Instead of concentrating on customers, they\nneed to look to noncustomers. And instead of focusing on customer\ndifferences, they need to build on powerful commonalities in what\nbuyers value. That allows companies to reach beyond existing demand to unlock a new mass of customers that did not exist before.\nThink of Callaway Golf. It aggregated new demand for its offering by looking to noncustomers. While the U.S. golf industry\nfought to win a greater share of existing customers, Callaway created a blue ocean of new demand by asking why sports enthusiasts\nand people in the country club set had not taken up golf as a sport.\nBy looking to why people shied away from golf, it found one key\ncommonality uniting the mass of noncustomers: Hitting the golf\nball was perceived as too difficult. The small size of the golf club\nhead demanded enormous hand-eye coordination, took time to\nmaster, and required concentration. As a result, fun was sapped for\nnovices, and it took too long to get good at the sport.\nThis understanding gave Callaway insight into how to aggregate\nnew demand for its offering. The answer was Big Bertha, a golf club\nwith a large head that made it far easier to hit the golf ball. Big\nBertha not only converted noncustomers of the industry into customers, but it also pleased existing golf customers, making it a runaway bestseller across the board. With the exception of pros, it\nturned out that the mass of existing customers also had been frustrated with the difficulty of advancing their game by mastering the\nskills needed to hit the ball consistently. The club’s large head also\nlessened this difficulty.\nInterestingly, however, existing customers, unlike noncustomers,\nhad implicitly accepted the difficulty of the game. Although the\nmass of existing customers didn’t like it, they had taken for granted\nthat that was the way the game was played. Instead of registering\ntheir dissatisfaction with golf club makers, they themselves accepted the responsibility to improve. By looking to noncustomers\nand focusing on their key commonalities—not differences—Call102 FORMULATING BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY\n\naway saw how to aggregate new demand and offer the mass of customers and noncustomers a leap in value.\nWhere is your locus of attention—on capturing a greater share\nof existing customers, or on converting noncustomers of the industry into new demand? Do you seek out key commonalities in what\nbuyers value, or do you strive to embrace customer differences\nthrough finer customization and segmentation? To reach beyond\nexisting demand, think noncustomers before customers; commonalities before differences; and desegmentation before pursuing\nfiner segmentation.\nThe Three Tiers of Noncustomers\nAlthough the universe of noncustomers typically offers big blue\nocean opportunities, few companies have keen insight into who\nnoncustomers are and how to unlock them. To convert this huge\nlatent demand into real demand in the form of thriving new customers, companies need to deepen their understanding of the universe of noncustomers.\nThere are three tiers of noncustomers that can be transformed\ninto customers. They differ in their relative distance from your market. As depicted in figure 5-1, the first tier of noncustomers is closest to your market. They sit on the edge of the market. They are\nbuyers who minimally purchase an industry’s offering out of necessity but are mentally noncustomers of the industry. They are waiting to jump ship and leave the industry as soon as the opportunity\npresents itself. However, if offered a leap in value, not only would\nthey stay, but also their frequency of purchases would multiply, unlocking enormous latent demand.\nThe second tier of noncustomers is people who refuse to use\nyour industry’s offerings. These are buyers who have seen your industry’s offerings as an option to fulfill their needs but have voted\nagainst them. In the Callaway case, for example, these were sports\nReach Beyond Existing Demand 103\n\nenthusiasts, especially the country club tennis set, who could have\nchosen golf but had consciously chosen against it.\nThe third tier of noncustomers is farthest from your market.\nThey are noncustomers who have never thought of your market’s\nofferings as an option. By focusing on key commonalities across\nthese noncustomers and existing customers, companies can understand how to pull them into their new market.\nLet’s look at each of the three tiers of noncustomers to understand how you can attract them and expand your blue ocean.\nFirst-Tier Noncustomers\nThese soon-to-be noncustomers are those who minimally use the\ncurrent market offerings to get by as they search for something better. Upon finding any better alternative, they will eagerly jump\nship. In this sense, they sit on the edge of the market. A market be104 FORMULATING BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY\nFIGURE 5-1\nThe Three Tiers of Noncustomers\nFirst Tier: “Soon-to-be” noncustomers who are on the edge of your market,\nwaiting to jump ship.\nSecond Tier: “Refusing” noncustomers who consciously choose against\nyour market.\nThird Tier: “Unexplored” noncustomers who are in markets distant from yours.\nThird\nTier\nYour\nMarket\nFirst\nTier\nSecond\nTier\n\ncomes stagnant and develops a growth problem as the number of\nsoon-to-be noncustomers increases. Yet locked within these firsttier noncustomers is an ocean of untapped demand waiting to be\nreleased.\nConsider how Pret A Manger, a British fast-food chain that opened\nin 1988, has expanded its blue ocean by tapping into the huge latent\ndemand of first-tier noncustomers. Before Pret, professionals in\nEuropean city centers principally frequented restaurants for\nlunch. Sit-down restaurants offered a nice meal and setting. However, the number of first-tier noncustomers was high and rising.\nGrowing concerns over the need for healthy eating gave people second thoughts about eating out in restaurants. And professionals\ndid not always have time for a sit-down meal. Some restaurants were\nalso too expensive for lunch on a daily basis. So professionals were\nincreasingly grabbing something on the run, bringing a brown bag\nfrom home, or even skipping lunch.\nThese first-tier noncustomers were in search of better solutions.\nAlthough there were numerous differences across them, they shared\nthree key commonalities: They wanted lunch fast, they wanted it\nfresh and healthy, and they wanted it at a reasonable price.\nThe insight gained from the commonalities across these first-tier\nnoncustomers shed light on how Pret could unlock and aggregate\nuntapped demand. The Pret formula is simple. It offers restaurantquality sandwiches made fresh every day from only the finest ingredients, and it makes the food available at a speed that is faster than\nthat of restaurants and even fast food. It also delivers this in a sleek\nsetting at reasonable prices.\nConsider what Pret is like. Walking into a Pret A Manger is like\nwalking into a bright Art Deco studio. Along the walls are clean refrigerated shelves stocked with more than thirty types of sandwiches (average price $4–$6) made fresh that day, in that shop, from\nfresh ingredients delivered earlier that morning. People can also\nchoose from other freshly made items, such as salads, yogurt, parfaits, blended juices, and sushi. Each store has its own kitchen, and\nnonfresh items are made by high-quality producers. Even in its\nReach Beyond Existing Demand 105\n\nNew York stores, Pret’s baguettes are from Paris, its croissants are\nfrom Belgium, and its Danish pastries are from Denmark. And\nnothing is kept over to the next day. Leftover food is given to homeless shelters.\nIn addition to offering fresh healthy sandwiches and other fresh\nfood items, Pret speeds up the customer ordering experience from\nfast food’s queue-order-pay-wait-receive-sit down purchasing cycle to\na much faster browse-pick up-pay-leave cycle. On average, customers\nspend just ninety seconds from the time they get in line to the time\nthey leave the shop. This is made possible because Pret produces\nready-made sandwiches and other things at high volume with a\nhigh standardization of assembly, does not make to order, and does\nnot serve its customers. They serve themselves as in a supermarket.\nWhereas sit-down restaurants have seen stagnant demand, Pret\nhas been converting the mass of soon-to-be noncustomers into core\nthriving customers who eat at Pret more often than they used to eat\nat restaurants. Beyond this, as with Callaway, restaurant-goers who\nwere content to eat lunch at restaurants also have been flocking to\nPret. Although restaurant lunches had been acceptable, the three\nkey commonalities of first-tier noncustomers struck a chord with\nthese people; but unlike soon-to-be noncustomers, they had not\nthought to question their lunch habits. The lesson: Noncustomers\ntend to offer far more insight into how to unlock and grow a blue\nocean than do relatively content existing customers.\nToday Pret A Manger sells more than twenty-five million sandwiches a year from its one hundred thirty stores in the U.K., and it\nrecently opened stores in New York and Hong Kong. In 2002 it had\nsales of more than £100m ($160 million). Its growth potential triggered McDonald’s to buy a 33 percent share of the company.\nWhat are the key reasons first-tier noncustomers want to jump\nship and leave your industry? Look for the commonalities across\ntheir responses. Focus on these, and not on the differences between\nthem. You will glean insight into how to desegment buyers and unleash an ocean of latent untapped demand.\n106 FORMULATING BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY\n\nSecond-Tier Noncustomers\nThese are refusing noncustomers, people who either do not use or\ncannot afford to use the current market offerings because they find\nthe offerings unacceptable or beyond their means. Their needs are\neither dealt with by other means or ignored. Harboring within refusing noncustomers, however, is an ocean of untapped demand\nwaiting to be released.\nConsider how JCDecaux, a vendor of French outdoor advertising space, pulled the mass of refusing noncustomers into its market.\nBefore JCDecaux created a new concept in outdoor advertising\ncalled “street furniture” in 1964, the outdoor advertising industry\nincluded billboards and transport advertisement. Billboards typically were located on city outskirts and along roads where traffic\nquickly passed by; transport advertisement comprised panels on\nbuses and taxies, which again people caught sight of only as they\nwhizzed by.\nOutdoor advertising was not a popular campaign medium for\nmany companies because it was viewed only in a transitory way.\nOutdoor ads were exposed to people for a very short time while they\nwere in transit, and the rate of repeat visits was low. Especially for\nlesser-known companies, such advertising media were ineffective\nbecause they could not carry the comprehensive messages needed\nto introduce new names and products. Hence, many such companies refused to use such low-value-added outdoor advertising because it was either unacceptable or a luxury they could not afford.\nHaving thought through the key commonalities that cut across\nrefusing noncustomers of the industry, JCDecaux realized that the\nlack of stationary downtown locations was the key reason the industry remained unpopular and small. In searching for a solution,\nJCDecaux found that municipalities could offer stationary downtown locations, such as bus stops, where people tended to wait a few\nminutes and hence had time to read and be influenced by advertisements. JCDecaux reasoned that if it could secure these locations to\nReach Beyond Existing Demand 107\n\nuse for outdoor advertising, it could convert second-tier noncustomers into customers.\nThis gave it the idea to provide street furniture, including maintenance and upkeep, free to municipalities. JCDecaux figured that\nas long as the revenue generated from selling ad space exceeded the\ncosts of providing and maintaining the furniture at an attractive\nprofit margin, the company would be on a trajectory of strong, profitable growth. Accordingly, street furniture was created that would\nintegrate advertising panels.\nIn this way, JCDecaux created a breakthrough in value for second-tier noncustomers, the municipalities, and itself. The strategy\neliminated cities’ traditional costs associated with urban furniture. In return for free products and services, JCDecaux gained the\nexclusive right to display advertisements on the street furniture located in downtown areas. By making ads available in city centers,\nthe company significantly increased the average exposure time, improving the recall capabilities of this advertising medium. The increase in exposure time also permitted richer contents and more\ncomplex messages. Moreover, as the maintainer of the urban furniture, JCDecaux could help advertisers roll out their campaigns in\ntwo to three days, as opposed to fifteen days of rollout time for traditional billboard campaigns.\nIn response to JCDecaux’s exceptional value offering, the mass\nof refusing noncustomers flocked to the industry. As a medium of\nadvertisement, street furniture became the highest-growth market\nin the overall display advertising industry. Global spending on\nstreet furniture between 1995 and 2000, for example, grew by 60 percent compared with a 20 percent total increase in overall display\nadvertising.\nBy signing contracts of eight to twenty-five years with municipalities, JCDecaux gained long-term exclusive rights for displaying\nads with street furniture. After an initial capital investment, the\nonly expenditure for JCDecaux in the subsequent years was the\nmaintenance and renewal of the furniture. The operating margin\nof street furniture was as high as 40 percent, compared with 14 per108 FORMULATING BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY\n\ncent for billboards and 18 percent for transport advertisements.\nThe exclusive contracts and high operating margins created a\nsteady source of long-term revenue and profits. With this business\nmodel, JCDecaux was able to capture a leap in value for itself in return for a leap in value created for its buyers.\nToday, JCDecaux is the number one street furniture-based ad\nspace provider worldwide, with 283,000 panels in thirty-three countries. What’s more, by looking to second-tier noncustomers and focusing on the key commonalities that turned them away from the\nindustry, JCDecaux also increased the demand for outdoor advertising by existing customers of the industry. Until then, existing\ncustomers had focused on what billboard locations or bus lines they\ncould secure, for what period, and for how much. They took for\ngranted that those were the only options available and worked\nwithin them. Again, it took noncustomers to shed insight into the\nimplicit assumptions of the industry and its existing customers that\ncould be challenged and rewritten to create a leap in value for all.\nWhat are the key reasons second-tier noncustomers refuse to use\nthe products or services of your industry? Look for the commonalities across their responses. Focus on these, and not on their differences. You will glean insight into how to unleash an ocean of latent\nuntapped demand.\nThird-Tier Noncustomers\nThe third tier of noncustomers is the farthest away from an industry’s existing customers. Typically, these unexplored noncustomers\nhave not been targeted or thought of as potential customers by any\nplayer in the industry. That’s because their needs and the business\nopportunities associated with them have somehow always been assumed to belong to other markets.\nIt would drive many companies crazy to know how many thirdtier noncustomers they are forfeiting. Just think of the long-held\nassumption that tooth whitening was a service provided exclusively by dentists and not by oral care consumer-product compaReach Beyond Existing Demand 109\n\nnies. Consequently, oral care companies, until recently, never looked\nat the needs of these noncustomers. When they did, they found an\nocean of latent demand waiting to be tapped; they also found that\nthey had the capability to deliver safe, high-quality, low-cost tooth\nwhitening solutions, and the market exploded.\nThis potential applies to most industries. Consider the U.S. defense aerospace industry. It has been argued that the inability to\ncontrol aircraft costs is a key vulnerability in the long-term military\nstrength of the United States.1 Soaring costs combined with shrinking budgets, concluded a 1993 Pentagon report, left the military\nwithout a viable plan to replace its aging fleet of fighter aircraft.2 If\nthe military couldn’t find a way to build aircraft differently, military leaders worried, the United States would not have enough airplanes to properly defend its interests.\nTraditionally, the Navy, Marines, and Air Force differed in their\nconceptions of the ideal fighter plane and hence each branch designed and built its own aircraft independently. The Navy argued\nfor a durable aircraft that would survive the stress of landing on\ncarrier decks. The Marines wanted an expeditionary aircraft capable of short takeoffs and landings. The Air Force wanted the fastest\nand most sophisticated aircraft.\nHistorically, these differences among the independent branches\nwere taken for granted, and the defense aerospace industry was regarded as having three distinct and separate segments. The Joint\nStrike Fighter (JSF) program challenged this industry practice.3 It\nlooked to all three segments as potentially unexplored noncustomers that could be aggregated into a new market of higher-performing, lower-cost fighter planes. Rather than accept the existing\nsegmentation and develop products according to the differences in\nspecifications and features demanded by each branch of the military, the JSF program questioned these differences. It searched for\nthe key commonalities across the three branches that had previously disregarded one another.\nThis process revealed that the two highest-cost components of\nthe three branches’ aircraft were the same: avionics (software) and\n110 FORMULATING BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY\n\nengines. The shared use and production of these components held\nthe promise of enormous cost reductions. Moreover, even though\neach branch had a long list of highly customized requirements,\nmost aircraft across branches performed the same missions.\nThe JSF team looked to understand how many of these highly\ncustomized features decisively influenced the branches’ purchase\ndecision. Interestingly, the Navy’s answer did not hinge on a wide\nrange of factors. Instead, it boiled down to only two: durability and\nmaintainability. With aircraft stationed on aircraft carriers thousands of miles away from the nearest maintenance hangar, the\nNavy wants a fighter that is easy to maintain and yet durable as a\nMack truck so that it can absorb the shock of carrier landings and\nconstant exposure to salt air. Fearing that these two essential qualities would be compromised with the requirements of the Marines\nand the Air Force, the Navy bought its aircraft separately.\nThe Marines had many differences in requirements from those of\nthe other branches, but again only two kept them from decisively\navoiding joint aircraft purchases: the need for short takeoff vertical landing (STOVL) and robust countermeasures. To support\ntroops in remote and hostile conditions the Marines need an aircraft that performs as a jet fighter and yet hovers like a helicopter.\nAnd given the low-altitude, expeditionary nature of their missions,\nthe Marines want an aircraft equipped with various countermeasures—flares, electronic jamming devices—to evade enemy groundto-air missiles because their planes are relatively easier targets\ngiven their short air-to-ground range.\nTasked with maintaining global air superiority, the Air Force demands the fastest aircraft and superior tactical agility—the ability\nto outmaneuver all current and future enemy aircraft—and one\nequipped with stealth technology: radar-absorbing materials and\nstructures to make it less visible to radar and therefore more likely to\nevade enemy missiles and aircraft. The other two branches’ aircraft\nlacked these factors, and hence the Air Force had not considered them.\nThese findings on unexplored noncustomers made the JSF a feasible project. The aim was to build one aircraft for all three divisions\nReach Beyond Existing Demand 111\n\nby combining those key factors while reducing or eliminating\neverything else—that is, all the factors that had been taken for\ngranted by each branch but provided little value, or factors that\nhad been overdesigned in the race to beat the competition. As outlined in figure 5-2, some twenty competing factors in the Marine,\nNavy, and Air Force segments were eliminated or reduced.\nBy combining the factors in this way and reducing or eliminating the rest, the JSF program is able to build one aircraft for all\nthree branches. The result is a dramatic drop in costs and hence the\nprice per aircraft, with a leap in value in performance for all three\nbranches. Specifically, the JSF promised to reduce costs to $33 mil112 FORMULATING BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY\nFIGURE 5-2\nThe Key Competing Factors of the Defense Aerospace\nIndustry, After JSF\nThe JSF eliminated or reduced all existing competing factors other than those shaded.\nAir Force Navy Marines\nLightweight Two engines STOVL\nIntegrated avionics Two seats Lightweight\nStealth Large wings Short wings Design\nSupercruise engine Durability Countermeasures\ncustomization\nLong-distance Long-distance\nAgility Maintainability\nAir-air Large/flexible Large/flexible\narmaments weapons payloads weapons payloads\nFixed internal Air-air and air-ground Air-ground Weapons\nweapons payload armaments armaments customization\nElectronic warfare\nAn aircraft built for An aircraft built An aircraft built Mission\nevery mission for every mission for every mission customization\n\nlion per aircraft from the current $190 million. At the same time,\nthe performance of the JSF, now called the F-35, promised to be superior to that of any of the top-performing aircraft for the three\nbranches: the Air Force’s F-22, the Marine’s AV-8B Harrier jet, and\nthe Navy’s F-18. Figure 5-3 illustrates how the JSF creates exceptional value by offering superior performance at lower costs.\nAs revealed in the figure, the strategy canvas shows that while\nthe JSF roughly maintains the distinctive strengths of the Air\nForce’s aircraft—agility and stealth—it also offers greater maintainability, durability, countermeasures, and STOVL, the key strengths\nrequired by the Navy and the Marines. These factors are powerful\nadditions that the Air Force had assumed it could not have. By focusing on these key decisive factors and dropping or reducing all\nother factors in the three dominant domains of customization—\nnamely, design, weapons, and mission customization—the JSF program was able to offer a superior fighter plane at a lower cost.\nReach Beyond Existing Demand 113\nFIGURE 5-3\nJoint Strike Fighter (F-35) Versus Air Force F-22\nHigh\nLow\nPrice Weapons Agility Maintainability Countermeasures\ncustomization\nDesign Mission Stealth Durability STOVL\ncustomization customization\nAir Force (F-22)\nJSF (F-35)\n\nBy reaching beyond the existing customers of each of the three\nmilitary branches, the JSF aggregated demand previously divided\namong them. In fall 2001, Lockheed Martin was awarded the massive $200 billion JSF contract—the largest military contract in history—over Boeing. The first JSF F-35 is set to be delivered in 2010.\nTo date, the Pentagon is confident that the program will be an unqualified success, not only because the strategic profile of the JSF\nF-35 achieves exceptional value but also, equally important, because it has won the support of all three defense branches.4\nGo for the Biggest Catchment\nThere is no hard-and-fast rule to suggest which tier of noncustomers you should focus on and when. Because the scale of blue\nocean opportunities that a specific tier of noncustomers can unlock varies across time and industries, you should focus on the tier\nthat represents the biggest catchment at the time. But you should\nalso explore whether there are overlapping commonalities across\nall three tiers of noncustomers. In that way, you can expand the\nscope of latent demand you can unleash. When that is the case, you\nshould not focus on a specific tier but instead should look across\ntiers. The rule here is to go for the largest catchment.\nThe natural strategic orientation of many companies is toward\nretaining existing customers and seeking further segmentation opportunities. This is especially true in the face of competitive pressure. Although this might be a good way to gain a focused\ncompetitive advantage and increase share of the existing market\nspace, it is not likely to produce a blue ocean that expands the market and creates new demand. The point here is not to argue that it’s\nwrong to focus on existing customers or segmentation but rather to\nchallenge these existing, taken-for-granted strategic orientations.\nWhat we suggest is that to maximize the scale of your blue ocean\nyou should first reach beyond existing demand to noncustomers and\ndesegmentation opportunities as you formulate future strategies.\n114 FORMULATING BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY\n\nIf no such opportunities can be found, you can then move on to\nfurther exploit differences among existing customers. But in making such a strategic move, you should be aware that you might end\nup landing in a smaller space. You should also be aware that when\nyour competitors succeed in attracting the mass of noncustomers\nwith a value innovation move, many of your existing customers\nmay be attracted away because they too may be willing to put their\ndifferences aside to gain the offered leap in value.\nIt is not enough to maximize the size of the blue ocean you are\ncreating. You must profit from it to create a sustainable win-win\noutcome.

This\nbrings us to the fourth principle of blue ocean strategy: Get the\nstrategic sequence right.\nThis chapter discusses the strategic sequence of fleshing out and\nvalidating blue ocean ideas to ensure their commercial viability.\nWith an understanding of the right strategic sequence and of how\nto assess blue ocean ideas along the key criteria in that sequence,\nyou dramatically reduce business model risk.\nThe Right Strategic Sequence\nAs shown in figure 6-1, companies need to build their blue ocean\nstrategy in the sequence of buyer utility, price, cost, and adoption.\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n\nThe starting point is buyer utility. Does your offering unlock exceptional utility? Is there a compelling reason for the mass of people to buy it? Absent this, there is no blue ocean potential to begin\nwith. Here there are only two options. Park the idea, or rethink it\nuntil you reach an affirmative answer.\n118 FORMULATING BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY\nFIGURE 6-1\nThe Sequence of Blue Ocean Strategy\nBuyer utility\nIs there exceptional buyer utility\nin your business idea?\nPrice\nIs your price easily accessible\nto the mass of buyers?\nCost\nCan you attain your cost target\nto profit at your strategic price?\nAdoption\nWhat are the adoption hurdles in\nactualizing your business idea?\nAre you addressing them up front?\nA Commercially\nViable\nBlue Ocean Idea\nYes\nNo—Rethink\nYes\nYes\nYes\nNo—Rethink\nNo—Rethink\nNo—Rethink\n\nWhen you clear the exceptional utility bar, you advance to the\nsecond step: setting the right strategic price. Remember, a company\ndoes not want to rely solely on price to create demand. The key\nquestion here is this: Is your offering priced to attract the mass of\ntarget buyers so that they have a compelling ability to pay for your\noffering? If it is not, they cannot buy it. Nor will the offering create\nirresistible market buzz.\nThese first two steps address the revenue side of a company’s\nbusiness model. They ensure that you create a leap in net buyer\nvalue, where net buyer value equals the utility buyers receive minus\nthe price they pay for it.\nSecuring the profit side brings us to the third element: cost. Can\nyou produce your offering at the target cost and still earn a healthy\nprofit margin? Can you profit at the strategic price—the price\neasily accessible to the mass of target buyers? You should not let\ncosts drive prices. Nor should you scale down utility because high\ncosts block your ability to profit at the strategic price. When the\ntarget cost cannot be met, you must either forgo the idea because\nthe blue ocean won’t be profitable, or you must innovate your\nbusiness model to hit the target cost. The cost side of a company’s\nbusiness model ensures that it creates a leap in value for itself in\nthe form of profit—that is, the price of the offering minus the cost\nof production. It is the combination of exceptional utility, strategic\npricing, and target costing that allows companies to achieve value\ninnovation—a leap in value for both buyers and companies.\nThe last step is to address adoption hurdles. What are the adoption hurdles in rolling out your idea? Have you addressed these up\nfront? The formulation of blue ocean strategy is complete only\nwhen you can address adoption hurdles in the beginning to ensure\nthe successful actualization of your idea. Adoption hurdles include,\nfor example, potential resistance to the idea by retailers or partners. Because blue ocean strategies represent a significant departure from red oceans, it is key to address adoption hurdles up front.\nHow can you assess whether your blue ocean strategy is passing\nthrough each of the four sequential steps? And how can you refine\nGet the Strategic Sequence Right 119\n\nyour idea to pass each bar? Let’s address these questions, starting\nwith utility.\nTesting for Exceptional Utility\nThe need to assess the buyer utility of your offering may seem selfevident. Yet many companies fail to deliver exceptional value because they are obsessed by the novelty of their product or service,\nespecially if new technology plays a part in it.\nConsider Philips’ CD-i, an engineering marvel that failed to offer\npeople a compelling reason to buy it. The player was promoted as\nthe “Imagination Machine” because of its diverse functions. CD-i\nwas a video machine, music system, game player, and teaching tool\nall wrapped into one. Yet it did so many different tasks that people\ncould not understand how to use it. In addition, it lacked attractive\nsoftware titles. So even though the CD-i theoretically could do almost anything, in reality it could do very little. Customers lacked a\ncompelling reason to use it, and sales never took off.\nManagers responsible for Philips’ CD-i (as well as Motorola’s\nIridium) fell into the same trap: They reveled in the bells and whistles of their new technology. They acted on the assumption that\nbleeding-edge technology is equivalent to bleeding-edge utility for\nbuyers—something that, our research found, is rarely the case.\nThe technology trap that snagged Philips and Motorola trips up\nthe best and brightest companies time and again. Unless the technology makes buyers’ lives dramatically simpler, more convenient,\nmore productive, less risky, or more fun and fashionable, it will not\nattract the masses no matter how many awards it wins. Think, for\nexample, of Starbucks, Cirque du Soleil, The Home Depot, Southwest Airlines, [yellow tail], or Ralph Lauren: Value innovation is\nnot the same as technology innovation.\nTo get around this trap, the starting point, as articulated in\nchapter 2, is to create a strategic profile that passes the initial lit120 FORMULATING BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY\n\nmus test of being focused, being divergent, and having a compelling\ntagline that speaks to buyers. Having done this, companies are\nready to expressly assess where and how the new product or service\nwill change the lives of its buyers. Such a difference in perspective\nis important because it means that the way a product or service is\ndeveloped becomes less a function of its technical possibilities and\nmore a function of its utility to buyers.\nThe buyer utility map helps managers look at this issue from the\nright perspective (see figure 6-2). It outlines all the levers companies can pull to deliver exceptional utility to buyers as well as the\nvarious experiences buyers can have with a product or service. This\nmap allows managers to identify the full range of utility spaces that\na product or service can potentially fill. Let’s look at the map’s dimensions in detail.\nGet the Strategic Sequence Right 121\nFIGURE 6-2\nThe Buyer Utility Map\n1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6.\nPurchase Delivery Use Supplements Maintenance Disposal\nThe Six Utility Levers\n Customer\nproductivity\nSimplicity\nConvenience\nRisk\nFun and\nimage\nEnvironmental\nfriendliness\nThe Six Stages of the Buyer Experience Cycle\n\nThe Six Stages of the Buyer Experience Cycle\nA buyer’s experience can usually be broken into a cycle of six\nstages, running more or less sequentially from purchase to disposal. Each stage encompasses a wide variety of specific experiences. Purchasing, for example, may include the experience of\nbrowsing eBay as well as the aisles of The Home Depot. At each\nstage, managers can ask a set of questions to gauge the quality of\nbuyers’ experience, as described in figure 6-3.\nThe Six Utility Levers\nCutting across the stages of the buyer’s experience are what we call\nutility levers: the ways in which companies can unlock exceptional\nutility for buyers. Most of the levers are obvious. Simplicity, fun\nand image, and environmental friendliness need little explanation.\nNor does the idea that a product might reduce a customer’s financial, physical, or credibility risks. And a product or service offers\nconvenience simply by being easy to obtain, use, or dispose of. The\nmost commonly used lever is that of customer productivity, in\nwhich an offering helps a customer do things faster or better.\nTo test for exceptional utility, companies should check whether\ntheir offering has removed the greatest blocks to utility across the\nentire buyer experience cycle for customers and noncustomers. The\ngreatest blocks to utility often represent the greatest and most\npressing opportunities to unlock exceptional value. Figure 6-4\nshows how a company can identify the most compelling hot spots to\nunlock exceptional utility. By locating your proposed offering on\nthe thirty-six spaces of the buyer utility map, you can clearly see\nhow, and whether, the new idea not only creates a different utility\nproposition from existing offerings but also removes the biggest\nblocks to utility that stand in the way of converting noncustomers\ninto customers. If your offering falls on the same space or spaces as\nthose of other players, chances are it is not a blue ocean offering.\n122 FORMULATING BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY\n\nFIGURE 6-3\nThe Buyer Experience Cycle\nPurchase Delivery Use Supplements Maintenance Disposal\nHow long does it take\nto find the product\nyou need?\nIs the place of\npurchase attractive\nand accessible?\nHow secure is the\ntransaction\nenvironment?\nHow rapidly can you\nmake a purchase?\nHow long does it take\nto get the product\ndelivered?\nHow difficult is it to\nunpack and install\nthe new product?\nDo buyers have to\narrange delivery themselves? If yes, how\ncostly and difficult\nis this?\nDoes the product\nrequire training or\nexpert assistance?\nIs the product easy to\nstore when not in use?\nHow effective are the\nproduct’s features and\nfunctions?\nDoes the product or\nservice deliver far more\npower or options than\nrequired by the average\nuser?

Before its debut, the more than five\nhundred automakers in the United States focused on building custom-made luxury autos for the wealthy. In terms of the buyer utility\nmap, the entire industry focused on image in the use phase, creating luxury cars for fashionable weekend outings. Only one of the\nthirty-six utility spaces was occupied.\nThe greatest blocks to utility for the mass of people, however,\nwere not in refining the auto’s luxury or stylish image. Rather, they\nhad to do with two other factors. One was convenience in the use\nphase. The bumpy and muddy dirt roads that prevailed at the century’s start were a natural for horses to tread over but often prevented finely crafted autos from passing. This significantly limited\nwhere and when cars could travel (driving on rainy and snowy days\nwas ill advised), making the use of the car limited and inconvenient. The second block to utility was risk in the maintenance phase.\nThe cars, being finely crafted and having multiple options, often\nbroke down, requiring experts to fix them, and experts were expensive and in short supply.\n124 FORMULATING BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY\nFIGURE 6-4\nUncovering the Blocks to Buyer Utility\nPurchase Delivery Use Supplements Maintenance Disposal\nCustomer Productivity: In which stage are the biggest blocks to customer productivity?\nSimplicity: In which stage are the biggest blocks to simplicity?\nConvenience: In which stage are the biggest blocks to convenience?\nRisk: In which stage are the biggest blocks to reducing risks?\nFun and Image: In which stage are the biggest blocks to fun and image?\nEnvironmental In which stage are the biggest blocks to\nFriendliness: environmental friendliness?\n\nIn one fell swoop, Ford’s Model T eliminated these two utility\nblocks. The Model T was called the car for the great multitude. It\ncame in only one color (black) and one model, with scant options.\nIn this way, Ford eliminated investments in image in the use phase.\nInstead of creating cars for weekends in the countryside—a luxury\nfew could justify—Ford’s Model T was made for everyday use. It\nwas reliable. It was durable; it was designed to travel effortlessly\nover dirt roads and in rain, sleet, or shine. It was easy to fix and use.\nPeople could learn to drive it in one day.\nIn this way the buyer utility map highlights the differences between ideas that genuinely create new and exceptional utility and\nthose that are essentially revisions of existing offerings or technological breakthroughs not linked to value. The aim is to check\nwhether your offering passes the exceptional utility test, as did the\nModel T. By applying this diagnostic, you can find out how your\nidea needs to be refined.\nWhere are the greatest blocks to utility across the buyer experience cycle for your customers and noncustomers? Does your offering effectively eliminate these blocks? If it does not, chances are\nyour offering is innovation for innovation’s sake or a revision of existing offerings. When a company’s offering passes this test, it is\nready to move to the next step.\nFrom Exceptional Utility to Strategic Pricing\nTo secure a strong revenue stream for your offering, you must set\nthe right strategic price. This step ensures that buyers not only will\nwant to buy your offering but also will have a compelling ability to\npay for it. Many companies take a reverse course, first testing the\nwaters of a new product or service by targeting novelty-seeking,\nprice-insensitive customers at the launch of a new business idea;\nonly over time do they drop prices to attract mainstream buyers. It\nis increasingly important, however, to know from the start what\nprice will quickly capture the mass of target buyers.\nGet the Strategic Sequence Right 125\n\nThere are two reasons for this change. First, companies are discovering that volume generates higher returns than it used to. As\nthe nature of goods becomes more knowledge intensive, companies\nbear much more of their costs in product development than in manufacturing. This is easy to understand in the software industry.\nProducing the first copy of the Windows XP operating system, for\nexample, cost Microsoft billions of dollars, whereas subsequent\ncopies involved no more than the nearly trivial cost of a CD. This\nmakes volume key.\nA second reason is that to a buyer, the value of a product or service may be closely tied to the total number of people using it. An\nexample is the online auction service managed by eBay. People will\nnot buy a product or service when it is used by few others. As a result of this phenomenon, called network externalities, many products and services are an all-or-nothing proposition: Either you sell\nmillions at once, or you sell nothing at all.1\nIn the meantime, the rise of knowledge-intensive products also\ncreates the potential for free riding. This relates to the nonrival\nand partially excludable nature of knowledge.2 The use of a rival\ngood by one firm precludes its use by another. So, for example,\nNobel Prize–winning scientists who are fully employed by IBM\ncannot simultaneously be employed by another company. Nor can\nscrap steel consumed by Nucor be simultaneously consumed for\nproduction by other minimill steel makers.\nIn contrast, the use of a nonrival good by one firm does not limit\nits use by another. Ideas fall into this category. So, for example,\nwhen Virgin Atlantic Airways launched its Upper Class brand—a\nnew concept in business-class travel that essentially combined the\nhuge seats and legroom of traditional first class with the price of\nbusiness-class tickets—other airlines were free to apply this idea to\ntheir own business-class service without limiting Virgin’s ability to\nuse it. This makes competitive imitation not only possible but less\ncostly. The cost and risk of developing an innovative idea are borne\nby the initiator, not the follower.\nThis challenge is exacerbated when the notion of excludability is\nconsidered. Excludability is a function both of the nature of the\n126 FORMULATING BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY\n\ngood and of the legal system. A good is excludable if the company\ncan prevent others from using it because of, for example, limited access or patent protection. Intel, for example, can exclude other microprocessor chipmakers from using its manufacturing facilities\nthrough property ownership laws. The women’s fitness club Curves,\nhowever, cannot exclude someone from walking into any of its centers, studying its layout, atmosphere, and exercise routine, and\nmimicking its women’s fitness concept: Women need only thirty\nminutes, three days a week, to get in shape while having fun with\nother women, with none of the usual embarrassment faced at gyms.\nThe highest value-added element of the Curves formula is not excludable. Once ideas are out there, knowledge naturally spills over\nto other firms.\nThis lack of excludability reinforces the risk of free riding. Like\nthe creative and explosive concepts of Curves, Starbucks, or Southwest Airlines, many of the most powerful blue ocean ideas have\ntremendous value but in themselves consist of no new technological discoveries. As a result they are neither patentable nor excludable and hence are vulnerable to imitation.\nAll this means that the strategic price you set for your offering\nmust not only attract buyers in large numbers but also help you to\nretain them. Given the high potential for free riding, an offering’s\nreputation must be earned on day one, because brand building\nincreasingly relies heavily on word-of-mouth recommendations\nspreading rapidly through our networked society. Companies must\ntherefore start with an offer that buyers can’t refuse and must keep\nit that way to discourage any free-riding imitations. This is what\nmakes strategic pricing key. Strategic pricing addresses this question: Is your offering priced to attract the mass of target buyers\nfrom the start so that they have a compelling ability to pay for it?\nWhen exceptional utility is combined with strategic pricing, imitation is discouraged.\nWe have developed a tool called the price corridor of the mass to\nhelp managers find the right price for an irresistible offer, which, by\nthe way, isn’t necessarily the lower price. The tool involves two distinct but interrelated steps (see figure 6-5).\nGet the Strategic Sequence Right 127\n\nStep 1: Identify the Price Corridor of the Mass\nIn setting a price, all companies look first at the products and services that most closely resemble their idea in terms of form. Typically\nthey look at other products and services within their industries.\nThat’s still a necessary exercise, of course, but it is not sufficient to\nattract new customers. So the main challenge in determining a\nstrategic price is to understand the price sensitivities of those people who will be comparing the new product or service with a host of\nvery different-looking products and services offered outside the\ngroup of traditional competitors.\nA good way to look outside industry boundaries is to list products and services that fall into two categories: those that take different forms but perform the same function, and those that take different\nforms and functions but share the same over-arching objective.\n128 FORMULATING BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY\nFIGURE 6-5\nThe Price Corridor of the Mass\nLower-level pricing\nStep 2: Specify a price level\nwithin the price corridor.\nStep 1: Identify the price\ncorridor of the mass.\nThree alternative product/service types:\nDifferent form\nSame Different form, and function,\n form same function same objective\nSize of circle is proportional to number\nof buyers that product/service attracts\nHigh degree of legal and\nresource protection\nDifficult to imitate\nSome degree of legal and\nresource protection\nLow degree of legal and\nresource protection\nEasy to imitate\nPrice Corridor\nof the Mass\nUpper-level pricing\nMid-level pricing\n\nDifferent form, same function. Many companies that create blue\noceans attract customers from other industries who use a product\nor service that performs the same function or bears the same core\nutility as the new one but takes a very different physical form. In\nthe case of Ford’s Model T, Ford looked to the horse-drawn carriage. The horse-drawn carriage had the same core utility as the\ncar: transportation for individuals and families. But it had a very\ndifferent form: a live animal versus a machine. Ford effectively converted the majority of noncustomers of the auto industry, namely\ncustomers of horse-drawn carriages, into customers of its own blue\nocean by pricing its Model T against horse-drawn carriages and not\nthe cars of other automakers.\nIn the case of the school lunch catering industry, raising this\nquestion led to an interesting insight. Suddenly those parents who\nmake their children’s lunches came into the equation. For many\nchildren, parents had the same function: making their child’s\nlunch. But they had a very different form: mom or dad versus a\nlunch line in the cafeteria.\nDifferent form and function, same objective. Some companies\nlure customers from even further away. Cirque du Soleil, for example, has diverted customers from a wide range of evening activities.\nIts growth came in part through drawing people away from other\nactivities that differed in both form and function. For example, bars\nand restaurants have few physical features in common with a circus. They also serve a distinct function by providing conversational\nand gastronomical pleasure, a very different experience from the\nvisual entertainment that a circus offers. Yet despite these differences in form and function, people have the same objective in undertaking these three activities: to enjoy a night out.\nListing the groups of alternative products and services allows\nmanagers to see the full range of buyers they can poach from other\nindustries as well as from nonindustries, such as parents (for the\nschool lunch catering industry) or the noble pencil in managing\nhousehold finances (for the personal finance software industry).\nGet the Strategic Sequence Right 129\n\nHaving done this, managers should then graphically plot the price\nand volume of these alternatives, as shown in figure 6-5.\nThis approach provides a straightforward way to identify where\nthe mass of target buyers is and what prices these buyers are prepared to pay for the products and services they currently use. The\nprice bandwidth that captures the largest groups of target buyers is\nthe price corridor of the mass.\nIn some cases, the range is very wide. For Southwest Airlines, for\nexample, the price corridor of the mass covered the group of people\npaying, on average, $400 to buy an economy-class short-haul ticket\nto about $60 for the cost of going the same distance by car. The key\nhere is not to pursue pricing against the competition within an industry but rather to pursue pricing against substitutes and alternatives across industries and nonindustries. Had Ford, for example,\npriced its Model T against other autos, which were more than three\ntimes the price of horse-drawn carriages, the market for the Model\nT would not have exploded.\nStep 2: Specify a Level Within the Price Corridor\nThe second part of the tool helps managers determine how high a\nprice they can afford to set within the corridor without inviting\ncompetition from imitation products or services. That assessment\ndepends on two principal factors. First is the degree to which the\nproduct or service is protected legally through patents or copyrights.\nSecond is the degree to which the company owns some exclusive\nasset or core capability, such as an expensive production plant, that\ncan block imitation. Dyson, a British electrical white goods company, for example, has been able to charge a high unit price for its\nbagless vacuum cleaner since the product’s launch in 1995, thanks\nto both strong patents and hard-to-imitate service capabilities.\nMany other companies have used upper-boundary strategic pricing to attract the mass of target buyers. Examples include DuPont\nwith its Lycra brand in specialty chemicals, Philips’ ALTO in the\nprofessional lighting industry, SAP in the business application\nsoftware industry, and Bloomberg in the financial software industry.\n130 FORMULATING BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY\n\nOn the other hand, companies with uncertain patent and asset\nprotection should consider pricing somewhere in the middle of the\ncorridor. As for companies that have no such protection, they must\nset a relatively low price. In the case of Southwest Airlines, because\nits service wasn’t patentable and required no exclusive assets, its\nticket prices fell into the lower boundary of the corridor—namely,\nagainst the price of car travel. Companies would be wise to pursue\nmid- to lower-boundary strategic pricing from the start if any of the\nfollowing apply:\n• Their blue ocean offering has high fixed costs and marginal\nvariable costs.\n• Their attractiveness depends heavily on network externalities.\n• Their cost structure benefits from steep economies of scale\nand scope. In these cases, volume brings with it significant\ncost advantages, something that makes pricing for volume\neven more key.\nThe price corridor of the mass not only signals the strategic\npricing zone central to pulling in an ocean of new demand but also\nsignals how you might need to adjust your initial price estimates to\nachieve this. When your offering passes the test of strategic pricing, you’re ready to move to the next step.\nFrom Strategic Pricing to Target Costing\nTarget costing, the next step in the strategic sequence, addresses\nthe profit side of the business model. To maximize the profit potential of a blue ocean idea, a company should start with the strategic\nprice and then deduct its desired profit margin from the price to arrive at the target cost. Here, price-minus costing, and not cost-plus\npricing, is essential if you are to arrive at a cost structure that is\nboth profitable and hard for potential followers to match.\nWhen target costing is driven by strategic pricing, however, it is\nusually aggressive. Part of the challenge of meeting the target cost\nGet the Strategic Sequence Right 131\n\nis addressed in building a strategic profile that has not only divergence but also focus, which makes a company strip out costs. Think\nof the cost reductions Cirque du Soleil enjoyed by eliminating animals and stars or that Ford enjoyed by making the Model T in one\ncolor and one model having few options.\nSometimes these reductions are sufficient to hit the cost target,\nbut often they are not. Consider the cost innovations that Ford had\nto introduce to meet its aggressive target cost for the Model T. Ford\nhad to scrap the standard manufacturing system, in which cars\nwere handmade by skilled craftsmen from start to finish. Instead,\nFord introduced the assembly line, which replaced skilled craftsmen with ordinary unskilled laborers, who worked one small task\nfaster and more efficiently, cutting the time to make a Model T from\ntwenty-one days to four days and cutting labor hours by 60 percent.3\nHad Ford not introduced these cost innovations, it could not have\nmet its strategic price profitably.\nInstead of drilling down and finding ways to creatively meet the\ntarget cost as Ford did, if companies give in to the tempting route\nof either bumping up the strategic price or cutting back on utility,\nthey are not on the path to lucrative blue waters. To hit the cost target, companies have three principal levers.\nThe first involves streamlining operations and introducing cost\ninnovations from manufacturing to distribution. Can the product’s\nor service’s raw materials be replaced by unconventional, less expensive ones—such as switching from metal to plastic or shifting a\ncall center from the U.K. to Bangalore? Can high-cost, low-valueadded activities in your value chain be significantly eliminated,\nreduced, or outsourced? Can the physical location of your product\nor service be shifted from prime real estate locations to lower-cost\nlocations, as The Home Depot, IKEA, and Wal-Mart have done in\nretail or Southwest Airlines has done by shifting from major to secondary airports? Can you truncate the number of parts or steps\nused in production by shifting the way things are made, as Ford did\nby introducing the assembly line? Can you digitize activities to reduce costs?\n132 FORMULATING BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY\n\nBy probing questions such as these, the Swiss watch company\nSwatch, for example, was able to arrive at a cost structure some 30\npercent lower than any other watch company in the world. At the\nstart, Nicolas Hayek, chairman of Swatch, set up a project team to\ndetermine the strategic price for the Swatch. At the time, cheap\n(about $75), high-precision quartz watches from Japan and Hong\nKong were capturing the mass market. Swatch set the price at $40,\na price at which people could buy multiple Swatches as fashion accessories. The low price left no profit margin for Japanese or Hong\nKong-based companies to copy Swatch and undercut its price. Directed to sell the Swatch for that price and not a penny more, the\nSwatch project team worked backwards to arrive at the target cost,\na process that involved determining the margin Swatch needed to\nsupport marketing and services and earn a profit.\nGiven the high cost of Swiss labor, Swatch was able to achieve\nthis goal only by making radical changes in the product and production methods. Instead of using the more traditional metal or\nleather, for example, Swatch used plastic. Swatch’s engineers also\ndrastically simplified the design of the watch’s inner workings, reducing the number of parts from one hundred fifty to fifty-one. Finally, the engineers developed new and cheaper assembly techniques;\nfor example, the watch cases were sealed by ultrasonic welding instead of screws. Taken together, the design and manufacturing\nchanges enabled Swatch to reduce direct labor costs from 30 percent to less than 10 percent of total costs. These cost innovations\nproduced a cost structure that is hard to beat and let Swatch profitably dominate the mass market for watches, a market previously\ndominated by Asian manufacturers with a cheaper labor pool.\nBeyond streamlining operations and introducing cost innovations, a second lever companies can pull to meet their target cost is\npartnering. In bringing a new product or service to market, many\ncompanies mistakenly try to carry out all the production and distribution activities themselves. Sometimes that’s because they see\nthe product or service as a platform for developing new capabilities. Other times it is simply a matter of not considering other outGet the Strategic Sequence Right 133\n\nside options. Partnering, however, provides a way for companies to\nsecure needed capabilities fast and effectively while dropping their\ncost structure. It allows a company to leverage other companies’ expertise and economies of scale. Partnering includes closing gaps in\ncapabilities through making small acquisitions when doing so is\nfaster and cheaper, providing access to needed expertise that has\nalready been mastered.\nA large part of IKEA’s ability to meet its target cost, for example,\ncomes down to partnering. IKEA seeks out the lowest prices for materials and production via partnering with some fifteen hundred\nmanufacturing companies in more than fifty countries to ensure it\nthe lowest cost and fastest production of products in its IKEA\nlineup of some twenty thousand items.\nOr consider German-based, world-leading business application\nsoftware maker SAP. By partnering with Oracle, SAP saved hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars in development costs and\ngot a world-class central database, namely Oracle’s, which sits\nat the heart of SAP’s core products R/2 and R/3. SAP went a step\nfurther and also partnered with leading consulting firms, such as\nCapgemini and Accenture, to gain a global sales force overnight at\nno extra cost. Whereas Oracle had the fixed costs of a much smaller\nsales force on its balance sheet, SAP was able to leverage Capgemini’s and Accenture’s strong global networks to reach SAP’s target\ncustomers, with no cost implication to the company.\nSometimes, however, no amount of streamlining and cost innovation or partnering will make it possible for a company to deliver\nits target cost. This brings us to the third lever companies can use\nto make their desired profit margin without compromising their\nstrategic price: changing the pricing model of the industry. By\nchanging the pricing model used—and not the level of the strategic\nprice—companies can often overcome this problem.\nWhen film videotapes first came out, for example, they were\npriced at around $80. Few people were willing to pay that amount\nbecause no one expected to watch the video more than two or three\ntimes. The strategic price of a video had to be set in relation to\n134 FORMULATING BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY\n\ngoing to the movies and not to owning a tape for life. So at $80 a\ntape, demand was not taking off. How could a company make\nmoney by selling the videos at only a few dollars if it followed the\npath of using strategic pricing? The answer was that it couldn’t.\nBlockbuster, however, got around this problem by changing the\npricing model from selling to renting. This allowed it to strategically price videotapes at only a few dollars per rental. The result\nwas that the home video market exploded and Blockbuster made\nmore money by repeatedly renting the same $80 videos than it\ncould have by selling them outright. Similarly, IBM exploded the\ntabulating market by shifting the pricing model from selling to\nleasing to hit its strategic price while covering its cost structure.\nIn addition to Blockbuster’s rental model or IBM’s leasing\nmodel, companies have used several innovations in pricing models\nto profitably deliver on the strategic price. One model is the timeshare. The New Jersey company NetJets follows this model to make\njets accessible to a wide range of corporate customers, who buy the\nright to use a jet for a certain amount of time rather than buy the\njet itself. Another model is the slice-share; mutual fund managers,\nfor example, bring high-quality portfolio services—traditionally\nprovided by private banks to the rich—to the small investor by selling a sliver of the portfolio rather than its whole.\nSome companies are abandoning the concept of price altogether.\nInstead, they give products to customers in return for an equity interest in the customer’s business. Hewlett-Packard, for example, has\ntraded high-powered servers to Silicon Valley start-ups for a share\nof their revenues. The customers get immediate access to a key capability, and HP stands to earn a lot more than the price of the machine. The aim is not to compromise on the strategic price but to hit\nthe target through a new price model. We call this pricing innovation. Remember, however, that what is a pricing innovation for one\nindustry, such as video rentals, is often a standard pricing model in\nanother industry.\nFigure 6-6 shows how value innovation typically maximizes\nprofit by using the foregoing three levers. As the figure depicts, a\nGet the Strategic Sequence Right 135\n\ncompany begins with its strategic price, from which it deducts its\ntarget profit margin to arrive at its target cost. To hit the cost target\nthat supports that profit, companies have two key levers: One is\nstreamlining and cost innovations, and the other is partnering.\nWhen the target cost cannot be met despite all efforts to build a\nlow-cost business model, the company should turn to the third\nlever, pricing innovation, to profitably meet the strategic price. Of\ncourse, even when the target cost can be met, pricing innovation\nstill can be pursued. When a company’s offering successfully addresses the profit side of the business model, the company is ready\nto advance to the final step in the sequence of blue ocean strategy.\n136 FORMULATING BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY\nFIGURE 6-6\nThe Profit Model of Blue Ocean Strategy\nThe Strategic Price\nThe Target Cost\nPricing Innovation\nStreamlining and\nCost Innovations Partnering\nThe Target Profit\n\nA business model built in the sequence of exceptional utility,\nstrategic pricing, and target costing produces value innovation. Unlike the practice of conventional technology innovators, value innovation is based on a win-win game among buyers, companies, and\nsociety. Appendix C, “The Market Dynamics of Value Innovation,”\nillustrates how such a game is played out in the market and shows\nthe economic and social welfare implications for its stakeholders.\nFrom Utility, Price, and Cost to Adoption\nEven an unbeatable business model may not be enough to guarantee the commercial success of a blue ocean idea. Almost by definition, it threatens the status quo, and for that reason it may provoke\nfear and resistance among a company’s three main stakeholders: its\nemployees, its business partners, and the general public. Before\nplowing forward and investing in the new idea, the company must\nfirst overcome such fears by educating the fearful.\nEmployees\nFailure to adequately address the concerns of employees about the\nimpact of a new business idea on their livelihoods can be expensive.\nWhen Merrill Lynch’s management, for example, announced plans\nto create an online brokerage service, its stock price fell by 14 percent as reports emerged of resistance and infighting within the\ncompany’s large retail brokerage division.\nBefore companies go public with an idea, they should make a\nconcerted effort to communicate to employees that they are aware\nof the threats posed by the execution of the idea. Companies\nshould work with employees to find ways of defusing the threats so\nthat everyone in the company wins, despite shifts in people’s roles,\nresponsibilities, and rewards. In contrast to Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. engaged employees in an open internal discussion of the company’s strategy for meeting the challenge\nGet the Strategic Sequence Right 137\n\nof the Internet. Morgan’s efforts paid off handsomely. Because\nthe market realized that its employees understood the need for an\ne-venture, the company’s shares rose 13 percent when it eventually\nannounced the venture.\nBusiness Partners\nPotentially even more damaging than employee disaffection is the\nresistance of partners who fear that their revenue streams or market positions are threatened by a new business idea. That was the\nproblem faced by SAP when it was developing its product AcceleratedSAP (ASAP), an enterprise software system that was fast to implement and hence low cost. ASAP brought business application\nsoftware within the reach of midsized and small companies for the\nfirst time. The problem was that the development of best-practice\ntemplates for ASAP required the active cooperation of large consulting firms that were deriving substantial income from lengthy\nimplementations of SAP’s other products. As a result, they were\nnot necessarily incentivized to find the fastest way to implement\nthe company’s software.\nSAP resolved the dilemma by openly discussing the issues with\nits partners. Its executives convinced the consulting firms that they\nstood to gain more business by cooperating. Although ASAP would\nreduce implementation time for small and midsized companies,\nconsultants would gain access to a new client base that would more\nthan compensate for some lost revenues from larger companies.\nThe new system would also offer consultants a way to respond to\ncustomers’ increasingly vocal concerns that business application\nsoftware took too long to implement.\nThe General Public\nOpposition to a new business idea can also spread to the general\npublic, especially if the idea is very new and innovative, threatening established social or political norms. The effects can be devas138 FORMULATING BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY\n\ntating. Consider Monsanto, which makes genetically modified foods.\nIts intentions have been questioned by European consumers, largely\nbecause of the efforts of environmental groups such as Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth, and the Soil Association. The attacks of\nthese groups have struck many chords in Europe, which has a history of environmental concern and powerful agricultural lobbies.\nMonsanto’s mistake was to let others take charge of the debate.\nThe company should have educated the environmental groups as\nwell as the public on the benefits of genetically modified food and\nits potential to eliminate world famine and disease. When the products came out, Monsanto should have given consumers a choice between organic and genetically modified foods by labeling which\nproducts had genetically modified seeds as their base. If Monsanto\nhad taken these steps, then instead of being vilified, it might have\nended up as the “Intel Inside” of food for the future—the provider\nof the essential technology.\nIn educating these three groups of stakeholders—your employees, your partners, and the general public—the key challenge is to\nengage in an open discussion about why the adoption of the new\nidea is necessary. You need to explain its merits, set clear expectations for its ramifications, and describe how the company will address them. Stakeholders need to know that their voices have been\nheard and that there will be no surprises. Companies that take the\ntrouble to have such a dialogue with stakeholders will find that it\namply repays the time and effort involved. (For a fuller discussion\nof how companies can engage stakeholders, see chapter 8.)\nThe Blue Ocean Idea Index\nAlthough companies should build their blue ocean strategy in the\nsequence of utility, price, cost, and adoption, these criteria form an\nintegral whole to ensure commercial success. The blue ocean idea\n(BOI) index provides a simple but robust test of this system view\n(see Figure 6-7).\nGet the Strategic Sequence Right 139\n\nAs shown in figure 6-7, had Philips’ CD-i and Motorola’s Iridium\nscored their ideas on the BOI index they would have seen how far\nthey were from opening up lucrative blue oceans. With respect to\nPhilips CD-i, it did not create exceptional buyer utility with its offering of complex technological functions and limited software\ntitles. It was priced out of reach of the mass of buyers, and its manufacturing process was complicated and costly. With its complicated design, it took more than thirty minutes to explain and sell to\ncustomers, something that gave no incentive for sales clerks to sell\nCD-i in fast-moving retail. Philips CD-i therefore failed all four criteria on the BOI index despite the billions poured into it.\nBy assessing the business idea of the CD-i against the BOI index\nduring development, Philips could have foreseen the shortcomings\nembedded in the idea and addressed them up front by simplifying\nthe product and locking in partners to develop winning software titles, setting a strategic price accessible to the masses, instituting\nprice-minus costing instead of cost-plus pricing, and working with\nretail to find a simple, easy way for the sales force to sell and explain the product in a few minutes.\n140 FORMULATING BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY\nFIGURE 6-7\nBlue Ocean Idea (BOI) Index\nDoCoMo\nPhilips Motorola i-mode\nCD-i Iridium Japan\nUtility Is there exceptional utility? Are there\ncompelling reasons to buy your offering? –– +\nPrice Is your price easily accessible to the\nmass of buyers? –– +\nCost Does your cost structure meet the\ntarget cost? –– +\nAdoption Have you addressed adoption hurdles\nup front? – +/– +\n\nSimilarly, Motorola’s Iridium was unreasonably expensive because of high production costs. It provided no attractive utility for\nthe mass of buyers, not being usable in buildings or cars and being\nthe size of a brick. When it came to adoption, Motorola overcame\nmany regulations and secured transmission rights from numerous\ncountries. Employees, partners, and the society were also reasonably motivated to accept the idea. But the company had a weak\nsales team and marketing channels in the global markets. Because\nMotorola was not able to follow up sales leads effectively, Iridium\nphone sets were sometimes unavailable when requested. Weak utility, price, and cost positions, plus average adoption ability, indicated that the Iridium idea would be a flop.\nIn contrast to these failures, consider NTT DoCoMo’s i-mode\nlaunch in Japan. In 1999, when most telecom operators were focusing on technology races and price competition over voice-based\nwireless devices, NTT DoCoMo, the largest Japanese telecom operator, launched i-mode to offer the Internet on cell phones. Regular\nmobile telephony in Japan had reached a high level of sophistication in terms of mobility, quality of voice, ease of use, and hardware design. But it offered few data-based services such as e-mail,\naccess to information, news, and games, and transaction capabilities, which were the killer applications of the PC-Internet world.\nThe i-mode service brought together the key advantages of these\ntwo alternative industries—the cell phone industry and the PCInternet industry—and created unique and superior buyer utility.\nThe i-mode service offered exceptional buyer utility at a price accessible to the mass of buyers. The monthly i-mode subscription fee,\nthe voice and data transmission fee, and the price of content were\nin the “nonreflection” strategic price zone, encouraging impulse\nbuying and reaching the masses as quickly as possible. For example, the monthly subscription fee for a content site is between ¥100\nand ¥300 ($1 and $3), which is the result of benchmarking against\nthe price of the weekly magazines most Japanese regularly pick up\nat their train station kiosk.\nAfter setting a price that was attractive to the mass of buyers,\nNTT DoCoMo strove to obtain the capabilities it needed to deliver\nGet the Strategic Sequence Right 141\n\nthe service within its cost target in order to turn a profit. In achieving this end, the company was never bounded by its own assets and\ncapabilities. While it focused on its traditional role as an operator\nto develop and maintain a high-speed, high-capacity network in the\ni-mode project, it sought to deliver other key elements of its offering by actively partnering with handset manufacturers and information providers.\nBy creating a win-win partnership network, the company aimed\nto meet and sustain the target cost set by its strategic price. Although there are many partners and dimensions involved in its\npartnership network, a few aspects are particularly relevant here.\nFirst, NTT DoCoMo regularly and persistently shared know-how\nand technology with its handset manufacturing partners to help\nthem stay ahead of their competitors. Second, the company played\nthe role of the portal and gateway to the wireless network, expanding and updating the list of i-mode menu sites while attracting content providers to join the i-mode list and create the content that\nwould boost user traffic. By handling the billing for the content\nproviders with a small commission fee, for example, the company\noffered content providers major cost savings associated with billing\nsystem development. At the same time DoCoMo also obtained a\ngrowing revenue stream for itself.\nMore importantly, instead of using the Wireless Markup Language (WML) under the WAP standard for site creation, i-mode\nused c-HTML, an existing and already widely used language in\nJapan. This made i-mode more attractive to content providers because under c-HTML, software engineers needed no retraining to\nconvert their existing Web sites, designed for the Internet environment, into sites for i-mode use, and thus they incurred no additional\ncosts. NTT DoCoMo also entered into collaborative arrangements\nwith key foreign partners, such as Sun Microsystems, Microsoft,\nand Symbian, to reduce the total development costs and shorten\nthe time for an effective launch.\nAnother key aspect of the i-mode strategy was the way the project\nwas carried out. A team specially dedicated to the project was set\n142 FORMULATING BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY\n\nup and given a clear mandate and autonomy. The head of the i-mode\nteam selected most of the team members and engaged them in an open\ndiscussion on how to create the new market of mobile data communications, making them committed to the project. All this created a\nfavorable corporate environment for the adoption of i-mode. Moreover, the win-win game the company created for its partners, as well\nas the readiness of the Japanese general public to use database\nservices, also contributed to the successful adoption of i-mode.\nThe i-mode service passed all four criteria on the BOI index, as\nshown earlier in figure 6-7. Indeed, i-mode turned out to be an explosive success. Six months after its launch, subscribers had\nreached the 1 million mark. Within two years, the number of subscribers had reached 21.7 million, and revenues from packet transmission alone had increased 130 times. By the end of 2003 the\nnumber of subscribers had reached 40.1 million, and revenues from\nthe transmission of data, pictures, and text increased from 295 million yen ($2.6 million) to 886.3 billion yen ($8 billion).\nDoCoMo is the only company that has been able to make money\nout of the mobile Internet. DoCoMo now exceeds its parent company, NTT, in terms of market capitalization as well as potential for\nprofitable growth.\nAlthough i-mode has been a huge success in Japan, its success\noutside Japan hinges on whether it can overcome regional adoption barriers of a regulatory, cultural, and emotional nature as\nwell as those stemming from partnership dynamics and infrastructure economics.\nHaving passed the blue ocean idea index, companies are ready to\nshift gears from the formulation side of blue ocean strategy to its\nexecution. The question is, How do you bring an organization with\nyou to execute this strategy even though it often represents a significant departure from the past? This brings us to the second part\nof this book, and the fifth principle of blue ocean strategy: overcoming key organizational hurdles, the subject of our next chapter.\nGet the Strategic Sequence Right 143\n\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\nPART T H REE\nExecuting Blue\nOcean Strategy\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\nC HAPTER 7\nOvercome Key\nOrganizational Hurdles\nONCE A COMPANY HAS DEVELOPED a blue ocean\nstrategy with a profitable business model, it must execute it. The challenge of execution exists, of course, for any strategy.\nCompanies, like individuals, often have a tough time translating\nthought into action whether in red or blue oceans. But compared\nwith red ocean strategy, blue ocean strategy represents a significant departure from the status quo. It hinges on a shift from convergence to divergence in value curves at lower costs. That raises the\nexecution bar.\nManagers have assured us that the challenge is steep. They face\nfour hurdles. One is cognitive: waking employees up to the need for\na strategic shift. Red oceans may not be the paths to future profitable growth, but they feel comfortable to people and may have\neven served an organization well until now, so why rock the boat?\nThe second hurdle is limited resources. The greater the shift in\nstrategy, the greater it is assumed are the resources needed to execute it. But resources were being cut, and not raised, in many of the\norganizations we studied.\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n\nThird is motivation. How do you motivate key players to move\nfast and tenaciously to carry out a break from the status quo? That\nwill take years, and managers don’t have that kind of time.\nThe final hurdle is politics. As one manager put it, “In our organization you get shot down before you stand up.”\nAlthough all companies face different degrees of these hurdles,\nand many may face only some subset of the four, knowing how to\ntriumph over them is key to attenuating organizational risk. This\nbrings us to the fifth principle of blue ocean strategy: Overcome key\norganizational hurdles to make blue ocean strategy happen in action.\nTo achieve this effectively, however, companies must abandon\nperceived wisdom on effecting change. Conventional wisdom asserts that the greater the change, the greater the resources and\ntime you will need to bring about results. Instead, you need to flip\nconventional wisdom on its head using what we call tipping point\nleadership. Tipping point leadership allows you to overcome these\nfour hurdles fast and at low cost while winning employees’ backing\nin executing a break from the status quo.\nTipping Point Leadership in Action\nConsider the New York City Police Department (NYPD), which executed a blue ocean strategy in the 1990s in the public sector. When\nBill Bratton was appointed police commissioner of New York City\nin February 1994, the odds were stacked against him to an extent\nfew executives ever face. In the early 1990s, New York City was veering toward anarchy. Murders were at an all-time high. Muggings,\nMafia hits, vigilantes, and armed robberies filled the daily headlines. New Yorkers were under siege. But Bratton’s budget was\nfrozen. Indeed, after three decades of mounting crime in New York\nCity, many social scientists had concluded that it was impervious\nto police intervention. The citizens of New York City were crying\nout. A front-page headline in the New York Post had screamed:\n“Dave do something!”—a direct call to then mayor David Dinkins\nto get crime down fast.1 With miserable pay, dangerous working\n148 EXECUTING BLUE OCEAN ST RATE G Y\n\nconditions, long hours, and little hope of advancement in a tenure\npromotion system, morale among the NYPD’s thirty-six thousand\nofficers was at rock bottom—not to mention the debilitating effects\nof budget cuts, dilapidated equipment, and corruption.\nIn business terms, the NYPD was a cash-strapped organization\nwith thirty-six thousand employees wedded to the status quo, unmotivated, and underpaid; a disgruntled customer base—New York\nCity’s citizens; and rapidly declining performance as measured by\nthe increase in crime, fear, and disorder. Entrenched turf wars and\npolitics topped off the cake. In short, leading the NYPD to execute\na shift in strategy was a managerial nightmare far beyond the imaginations of most executives. The competition—the criminals—was\nstrong and rising.\nYet in less than two years and without an increase in his budget,\nBratton turned New York City into the safest large city in the United\nStates. He broke out of the red ocean with a blue ocean policing\nstrategy that revolutionized U.S. policing as it was then known. Between 1994 and 1996, the organization won as “profits” jumped:\nFelony crime fell 39 percent, murders 50 percent, and theft 35 percent. “Customers” won: Gallup polls reported that public confidence\nin the NYPD leaped from 37 percent to 73 percent. And employees\nwon: Internal surveys showed job satisfaction in the NYPD reaching an all-time high. As one patrolman put it, “We would have\nmarched to hell and back for that guy.” Perhaps most impressively,\nthe changes have outlasted its leader, implying a fundamental shift\nin the organizational culture and strategy of the NYPD. Even after\nBratton’s departure in 1996, crime rates have continued to fall.\nFew corporate leaders face organizational hurdles as steep as\nBratton did in executing a break from the status quo. And still\nfewer are able to orchestrate the type of performance leap that\nBratton achieved under any organizational conditions, let alone\nthose as stringent as he encountered. Even Jack Welch needed\nsome ten years and tens of millions of dollars of restructuring and\ntraining to turn GE into a powerhouse.\nMoreover, defying conventional wisdom, Bratton achieved these\nbreakthrough results in record time with scarce resources while\nOvercome Key Organizational Hurdles 149\n\nlifting employee morale, creating a win-win for all involved. Nor\nwas this Bratton’s first strategic reversal. It was his fifth, with each\nof the others also achieved despite his facing all four hurdles that\nmanagers consistently claim limit their ability to execute blue\nocean strategy: the cognitive hurdle that blinds employees from\nseeing that radical change is necessary; the resource hurdle that is\nendemic in firms; the motivational hurdle that discourages and demoralizes staff; and the political hurdle of internal and external resistance to change (see figure 7-1).\nThe Pivotal Lever: Disproportionate\nInfluence Factors\nTipping point leadership traces its roots to the field of epidemiology and the theory of tipping points.2 It hinges on the insight that\n150 EXECUTING BLUE OCEAN ST RATE G Y\nFIGURE 7-1\nThe Four Organizational Hurdles to Strategy Execution\nCognitive Hurdle\nAn organization\nwedded to the\nstatus quo\nMotivational Hurdle\nUnmotivated staff\nPolitical Hurdle\nOpposition from\npowerful vested\ninterests\nResource Hurdle\nLimited resources\n\nin any organization, fundamental changes can happen quickly\nwhen the beliefs and energies of a critical mass of people create an\nepidemic movement toward an idea. Key to unlocking an epidemic\nmovement is concentration, not diffusion.\nTipping point leadership builds on the rarely exploited corporate reality that in every organization, there are people, acts, and activities that exercise a disproportionate influence on performance.\nHence, contrary to conventional wisdom, mounting a massive challenge is not about putting forth an equally massive response where\nperformance gains are achieved by proportional investments in\ntime and resources. Rather, it is about conserving resources and\ncutting time by focusing on identifying and then leveraging the factors of disproportionate influence in an organization.\nThe key questions answered by tipping point leaders are as follows: What factors or acts exercise a disproportionately positive influence on breaking the status quo? On getting the maximum bang\nout of each buck of resources? On motivating key players to aggressively move forward with change? And on knocking down political\nroadblocks that often trip up even the best strategies? By singlemindedly focusing on points of disproportionate influence, tipping\npoint leaders can topple the four hurdles that limit execution of\nblue ocean strategy. They can do this fast and at low cost.\nLet us consider how you can leverage disproportionate influence\nfactors to tip all four hurdles to move from thought to action in the\nexecution of blue ocean strategy.\nBreak Through the Cognitive Hurdle\nIn many turnarounds and corporate transformations, the hardest\nbattle is simply to make people aware of the need for a strategic shift\nand to agree on its causes. Most CEOs will try to make the case for\nchange simply by pointing to the numbers and insisting that the company set and achieve better results: “There are only two performance\nalternatives: to make the performance targets or to beat them.”\nOvercome Key Organizational Hurdles 151\n\nBut as we all know, figures can be manipulated. Insisting on\nstretch goals encourages abuse in the budgetary process. This, in\nturn, creates hostility and suspicion between the various parts of\nan organization. Even when the numbers are not manipulated, they\ncan mislead. Salespeople on commission, for example, are seldom\nsensitive to the costs of the sales they produce.\nWhat’s more, messages communicated through numbers seldom\nstick with people. The case for change feels abstract and removed\nfrom the sphere of the line managers, who are the very people the\nCEO needs to win over. Those whose units are doing well feel that\nthe criticism is not directed at them; the problem is top management’s. Meanwhile, managers of poorly performing units feel that\nthey are being put on notice, and people who are worried about personal job security are more likely to scan the job market than to try\nto solve the company’s problems.\nTipping point leadership does not rely on numbers to break\nthrough the organization’s cognitive hurdle. To tip the cognitive\nhurdle fast, tipping point leaders such as Bratton zoom in on the\nact of disproportionate influence: making people see and experience harsh reality firsthand. Research in neuroscience and cognitive science shows that people remember and respond most\neffectively to what they see and experience: “Seeing is believing.”\nIn the realm of experience, positive stimuli reinforce behavior,\nwhereas negative stimuli change attitudes and behavior. Simply\nput, if a child puts a finger in icing and tastes it, the better it tastes\nthe more the child will taste it repetitively. No parental advice is\nneeded to encourage that behavior. Conversely, after a child puts a\nfinger on a burning stove, he or she will never do it again. After a\nnegative experience, children will change their behavior of their\nown accord; again, no parental pestering is required.3 On the other\nhand, experiences that don’t involve touching, seeing, or feeling actual results, such as being presented with an abstract sheet of numbers, are shown to be non-impactful and easily forgotten.4\nTipping point leadership builds on this insight to inspire a fast\nchange in mindset that is internally driven of people’s own accord.\n152 EXECUTING BLUE OCEAN ST RATE G Y\n\nInstead of relying on numbers to tip the cognitive hurdle, they\nmake people experience the need for change in two ways.\nRide the “Electric Sewer”\nTo break the status quo, employees must come face-to-face with the\nworst operational problems. Don’t let top brass, middle brass, or any\nbrass hypothesize about reality. Numbers are disputable and uninspiring, but coming face-to-face with poor performance is shocking\nand inescapable, but actionable. This direct experience exercises a\ndisproportionate influence on tipping people’s cognitive hurdle fast.\nConsider this example. In the 1990s the New York subway system\nreeked of fear, so much so that it earned the epithet “electric\nsewer.” Revenues were tumbling fast as citizens boycotted the system. But members of the New York City Transit Police department\nwere in denial. Why? Only 3 percent of the city’s major crimes happened on the subway. So no matter how much the public cried out,\ntheir cries fell on deaf ears. There was no perceived need to rethink\npolice strategies.\nThen Bratton was appointed chief, and in a matter of weeks he\norchestrated a complete break from the status quo in the mindset of\nthe city’s police. How? Not by force, nor by arguing for numbers,\nbut by making top brass and middle brass—starting with himself—\nride the electric sewer day and night. Until Bratton came along,\nthat had not been done.\nAlthough the statistics may have told the police that the subway\nwas safe, what they now saw was what every New Yorker faced every\nday: a subway system on the verge of anarchy. Gangs of youths patrolled the cars, people jumped turnstiles, and the riders faced graffiti, aggressive begging, and winos sprawled over benches. The\npolice could no longer evade the ugly truth. No one could argue\nthat current police strategies didn’t require a substantial departure from the status quo—and fast.\nShowing the worst reality to your superiors can also shift their\nmindset fast. A similar approach works to help sensitize superiors\nOvercome Key Organizational Hurdles 153\n\nto a leader’s needs fast. Yet few leaders exploit the power of this\nrapid wake-up call. Rather, they do the opposite. They try to garner\nsupport based on a numbers case that lacks urgency and emotional\nimpetus. Or they try to put forth the most exemplary case of their\noperational excellence to garner support. Although these alternatives may work, neither leads to tipping superiors’ cognitive hurdle\nas fast and stunningly as showing the worst.\nWhen Bratton, for example, was running the police division of\nthe Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA), the\nMBTA board decided to purchase small squad cars that would be\ncheaper to buy and to run. That went against Bratton’s new policing strategy. Instead of fighting the decision, however, or arguing\nfor a larger budget—something that would have taken months to\nreevaluate and probably would have been rejected in the end—\nBratton invited the MBTA’s general manager for a tour of his unit\nto see the district.\nTo let the general manager see the horror he was trying to rectify, Bratton picked him up in a small car just like the ones that\nwere being ordered. He jammed the seats up front to let the manager feel how little legroom a six-foot cop would get, and then Bratton drove over every pothole he could. Bratton also put on his belt,\ncuffs, and gun for the trip so that the manager would see how little\nspace there was for the tools of the police officer’s trade. After two\nhours, the general manager wanted out. He told Bratton he didn’t\nknow how Bratton could stand being in such a cramped car for so\nlong on his own, never mind having a criminal in the back seat.\nBratton got the larger cars his new strategy demanded.\nMeet with Disgruntled Customers\nTo tip the cognitive hurdle, not only must you get your managers\nout of the office to see operational horror, but also you must get\nthem to listen to their most disgruntled customers firsthand. Don’t\nrely on market surveys. To what extent does your top team actively\n154 EXECUTING BLUE OCEAN ST RATE G Y\n\nobserve the market firsthand and meet with your most disgruntled\ncustomers to hear their concerns? Do you ever wonder why sales\ndon’t match your confidence in your product? Simply put, there\nis no substitute for meeting and listening to dissatisfied customers\ndirectly.\nIn the late 1970s, Boston’s Police District 4, which housed the\nSymphony Hall, Christian Science Mother Church, and other cultural institutions, was experiencing a serious surge in crime. The\npublic was increasingly intimidated; residents were selling their\nhomes and leaving, thereby pushing the community into a downward spiral. But even though the citizens were leaving the area\nin droves, the police force under Bratton’s direction felt they\nwere doing a fine job. The performance indicators they historically\nused to benchmark themselves against other police departments\nwere tip-top: 911 response times were down, and felony crime arrests were up. To solve the paradox Bratton arranged a series\nof town hall meetings between his officers and the neighborhood\nresidents.\nIt didn’t take long to find the gap in perceptions. Although the\npolice officers took great pride in short response times and their\nrecord in solving major crimes, these efforts went unnoticed and\nunappreciated by citizens; few felt endangered by large-scale crimes.\nWhat they felt victimized by and harassed by were the constant\nminor irritants: winos, panhandlers, prostitutes, and graffiti.\nThe town meetings led to a complete overhaul of police priorities to focus on the blue ocean strategy of “broken windows.”5\nCrime went down, and the neighborhood felt safe again.\nWhen you want to wake up your organization to the need for a\nstrategic shift and a break from the status quo, do you make your\ncase with numbers? Or do you get your managers, employees, and\nsuperiors (and yourself) face-to-face with your worst operational\nproblems? Do you get your managers to meet the market and listen\nto disenchanted customers holler? Or do you outsource your eyes\nand send out market research questionnaires?\nOvercome Key Organizational Hurdles 155\n\nJump the Resource Hurdle\nAfter people in an organization accept the need for a strategic shift\nand more or less agree on the contours of the new strategy, most\nleaders are faced with the stark reality of limited resources. Do\nthey have the money to spend on the necessary changes? At this\npoint, most reformist CEOs do one of two things. Either they trim\ntheir ambitions and demoralize their work force all over again, or\nthey fight for more resources from their bankers and shareholders,\na process that can take time and divert attention from the underlying problems. That’s not to say that this approach is not necessary\nor worthwhile, but acquiring more resources is often a long, politically charged process.\nHow do you get an organization to execute a strategic shift with\nfewer resources? Instead of focusing on getting more resources, tipping point leaders concentrate on multiplying the value of the resources they have. When it comes to scarce resources, there are\nthree factors of disproportionate influence that executives can\nleverage to dramatically free resources, on the one hand, and multiply the value of resources, on the other. These are hot spots, cold\nspots, and horse trading.\nHot spots are activities that have low resource input but high potential performance gains. In contrast, cold spots are activities that\nhave high resource input but low performance impact. In every organization, hot spots and cold spots typically abound. Horse trading involves trading your unit’s excess resources in one area for\nanother unit’s excess resources to fill remaining resource gaps. By\nlearning to use their current resources right, companies often find\nthey can tip the resource hurdle outright.\nWhat actions consume your greatest resources but have scant\nperformance impact? Conversely, what activities have the greatest\nperformance impact but are resource starved? When the questions\nare framed in this way, organizations rapidly gain insight into freeing up low-return resources and redirecting them to high-impact\n156 EXECUTING BLUE OCEAN ST RATE G Y\n\nareas. In this way, both lower costs and higher value are simultaneously pursued and achieved.\nRedistribute Resources to Your Hot Spots\nAt the New York Transit Police, Bratton’s predecessors argued that\nto make the city’s subways safe they had to have an officer ride\nevery subway line and patrol every entrance and exit. To increase\nprofits (lower crime) would mean increasing costs (police officers)\nin multiples that were not possible given the budget. The underlying logic was that increments in performance could be achieved\nonly with proportional increments in resources—the same inherent logic guiding most companies’ view of performance gains.\nBratton, however, achieved the sharpest drop in subway crime,\nfear, and disorder in Transit’s history, not with more police officers\nbut with police officers targeted at hot spots. His analysis revealed\nthat although the subway system was a maze of lines and entrances\nand exits, the vast majority of crimes occurred at only a few stations and on a few lines. He also found that these hot spots were\nstarved for police attention even though they exercised a disproportionate impact on crime performance, whereas lines and stations that almost never reported criminal activity were staffed\nequally. The solution was a complete refocusing of cops at subway\nhot spots to overwhelm the criminal element. And crime came tumbling down while the size of the police force remained constant.\nSimilarly, before Bratton’s arrival at the NYPD the narcotics\nunit worked nine-to-five weekday-only shifts and made up less than\n5 percent of the department’s human resources. To search out resource hot spots, in one of his initial meetings with the NYPD’s\nchiefs Bratton’s deputy commissioner of crime strategy, Jack Maple,\nasked people around the table for their estimates of the percentage\nof crimes attributable to narcotics usage. Most said 50 percent, others 70 percent; the lowest estimate was 30 percent. On that basis,\nas Maple pointed out, it was hard to argue that a narcotics unit\nconsisting of less than 5 percent of the NYPD force was not grossly\nOvercome Key Organizational Hurdles 157\n\nunderstaffed. What’s more, it turned out that the narcotics squad\nlargely worked Monday to Friday, even though most drugs were\nsold over the weekend, when drug-related crimes persistently occurred. Why? That was the way it had always been; it was the unquestioned modus operandi.\nWhen these facts were presented and the hot spot identified,\nBratton’s case for a major reallocation of staff and resources within\nthe NYPD was quickly accepted. Accordingly, Bratton reallocated\nstaff and resources on the hot spot, and drug crime plummeted.\nWhere did he get the resources to do this? He simultaneously assessed his organization’s cold spots.\nRedirect Resources from Your Cold Spots\nLeaders need to free up resources by searching out cold spots.\nAgain in the subway, Bratton found that one of the biggest cold\nspots was processing criminals in court. On average, it would take\nan officer sixteen hours to take someone downtown to process even\nthe pettiest of crimes. This was time officers were not patrolling the\nsubway and adding value.\nBratton changed all that. Instead of bringing criminals to the\ncourt, he brought processing centers to the criminals by using\n“bust buses”—roving old buses retrofitted into miniature police\nstations that were parked outside subway stations. Now instead of\ndragging a suspect down to the courthouse across town, a police officer needed only escort the suspect up to street level to the bus.\nThis cut processing time from sixteen hours to just one, freeing\nmore officers to patrol the subway and catch criminals.\nEngage in Horse Trading\nIn addition to internally refocusing the resources a unit already\ncontrols, tipping point leaders skillfully trade resources they don’t\nneed for those of others that they do need. Consider again the case\nof Bratton. The chiefs of public sector organizations know that the\n158 EXECUTING BLUE OCEAN ST RATE G Y\n\nsize of their budgets and the number of people they control are\noften hotly debated because public sector resources are notoriously limited. This makes chiefs of public sector organizations unwilling to advertise excess resources, let alone release them for use\nby other parts of the larger organization, because that would risk a\nloss of control over those resources. One result is that over time,\nsome organizations become well endowed with resources they don’t\nneed even while they are short of ones they do need.\nOn taking over as chief of the New York Transit Police in 1990,\nBratton’s general counsel and policy adviser, Dean Esserman (now\npolice chief of Providence, Rhode Island), played a key horse trading role. Esserman discovered that the Transit unit, which was\nstarved for office space, had been running a fleet of unmarked cars\nin excess of its needs. The New York Division of Parole, on the\nother hand, was short of cars but had excess office space. Esserman\nand Bratton offered the obvious trade, which was gratefully accepted by the parole officials. For their part, Transit unit officers\nwere delighted to get the first floor of a prime downtown building.\nThe deal stoked Bratton’s credibility within the organization,\nsomething that later made it easier for him to introduce more fundamental changes. At the same time, it marked him to his political\nbosses as a man who could solve problems.\nFigure 7-2 illustrates how radically Bratton refocused the Transit Police department’s resources to break out of the red ocean and\nexecute its blue ocean strategy. The vertical axis here shows the\nrelative level of resource allocation, and the horizontal axis shows\nthe various elements of strategy in which the investments were\nmade. By deemphasizing or virtually eliminating some traditional\nfeatures of transit police work while increasing emphasis on the\nothers or creating new ones, Bratton achieved a dramatic shift in\nresource allocation.\nWhereas the actions of eliminating and reducing cut the costs\nfor the organization, raising certain elements or creating new ones\nrequired added investments. As you can see on the strategy canvas,\nhowever, the overall investment of resources remained more or less\nOvercome Key Organizational Hurdles 159\n\nconstant. At the same time, the value to citizens went way up. Eliminating the practice of widespread coverage of the subway system\nand replacing it with a targeted strategy on hot spots enabled the\ntransit police to combat subway crimes more efficiently and effectively. Reducing the involvement of officers in processing arrests or\ncold spots and creating bust buses significantly raised the value of\nthe police force by allowing officers to concentrate their time and\nattention on policing the subway. Raising the level of investment in\ncombating quality-of-life crimes rather than big crimes refocused\nthe police resources on crimes that presented constant dangers to\ncitizens’ daily lives. Through these moves, the New York Transit\nPolice significantly enhanced the performance of its officers, who\nwere now freed from administrative hassles and assigned clear du160 EXECUTING BLUE OCEAN ST RATE G Y\nFIGURE 7-2\nThe Strategy Canvas of Transit: How Bratton Refocused Resources\nHigh\nLow\nWidespread Arrests of Arrests Focus on Use of “bust buses”\npatrols of warrant violators quality-of-life for processing\nsubway in daytime crimes arrests\nsystem Involvement Issuance of desk Group Arrests of warrant Train sweeps\nof officers in appearance tickets arrests violators during for safe\nprocessing (which violators had sleeping hours atmosphere\narrests routinely ignored)\nAfter Bratton’s Appointment\nBefore Bratton’s Appointment\n\nties as to what kinds of crimes they should focus on and where to\ncombat them.\nAre you allocating resources based on old assumptions, or do\nyou seek out and concentrate resources on hot spots? Where are\nyour hot spots? What activities have the greatest performance impact but are resource starved? Where are your cold spots? What activities are resource oversupplied but have scant performance\nimpact? Do you have a horse trader, and what can you trade?\nJump the Motivational Hurdle\nTo reach your organization’s tipping point and execute blue ocean\nstrategy, you must alert employees to the need for a strategic shift\nand identify how it can be achieved with limited resources. For a\nnew strategy to become a movement, people must not only recognize what needs to be done, but they must also act on that insight in\na sustained and meaningful way.\nHow can you motivate the mass of employees fast and at low\ncost? When most business leaders want to break from the status\nquo and transform their organizations, they issue grand strategic\nvisions and turn to massive top-down mobilization initiatives. They\nact on the assumption that to create massive reactions, proportionate massive actions are required. But this is often a cumbersome,\nexpensive, and time-consuming process, given the wide variety of\nmotivational needs in most large companies. And overarching\nstrategic visions often inspire lip service instead of the intended\naction. It would be easier to turn an aircraft carrier around in a\nbathtub.\nOr is there another way? Instead of diffusing change efforts\nwidely, tipping point leaders follow a reverse course and seek massive concentration. They focus on three factors of disproportionate\ninfluence in motivating employees, what we call kingpins, fishbowl\nmanagement, and atomization.\nOvercome Key Organizational Hurdles 161\n\nZoom in on Kingpins\nFor strategic change to have real impact, employees at every level\nmust move en masse. To trigger an epidemic movement of positive\nenergy, however, you should not spread your efforts thin. Rather,\nyou should concentrate your efforts on kingpins, the key influencers in the organization. These are people inside the organization\nwho are natural leaders, who are well respected and persuasive, or\nwho have an ability to unlock or block access to key resources. As\nwith kingpins in bowling, when you hit them straight on, all the\nother pins come toppling down. This frees an organization from\ntackling everyone, and yet in the end everyone is touched and\nchanged. And because in most organizations there are a relatively\nsmall number of key influencers, who tend to share common problems and concerns, it is relatively easy for the CEO to identify and\nmotivate them.\nAt the NYPD, for example, Bratton zoomed in on the seventy-six\nprecinct heads as his key influencers and kingpins. Why? Each\nprecinct head directly controlled two hundred to four hundred police officers. Hence, galvanizing these seventy-six heads would have\nthe natural ripple effect of touching and motivating the thirty-sixthousand-deep police force to embrace the new policing strategy.\nPlace Kingpins in a Fishbowl\nAt the heart of motivating the kingpins in a sustained and meaningful way is to shine a spotlight on their actions in a repeated and\nhighly visible way. This is what we refer to as fishbowl management,\nwhere kingpins’ actions and inaction are made as transparent to\nothers as are fish in a bowl of water. By placing kingpins in a fishbowl in this way you greatly raise the stakes of inaction. Light is\nshined on who is lagging behind, and a fair stage is set for rapid\nchange agents to shine. For fishbowl management to work it must\nbe based on transparency, inclusion, and fair process.\n162 EXECUTING BLUE OCEAN ST RATE G Y\n\nAt the NYPD, Bratton’s fishbowl was a biweekly crime strategy\nreview meeting known as Compstat that brought together the city’s\ntop brass to review the performance of all the seventy-six precinct\ncommanders in executing its new strategy. Attendance was mandatory for all precinct commanders; three-star chiefs, deputy commissioners, and borough chiefs were also required to attend. Bratton\nhimself was there as often as possible. As each precinct commander\nwas questioned on decreases and increases in crime performance in\nfront of peers and superiors based on the organization’s new strategic directives, enormous computer-generated overhead maps and\ncharts were shown, visually illustrating in inescapable terms the\ncommander’s performance in executing the new strategy. The commander was responsible for explaining the maps, describing how\nhis or her officers were addressing the issues, and outlining why\nperformance was going up or down. These inclusive meetings instantly made results and responsibilities clear and transparent for\neveryone.\nAs a result, an intense performance culture was created in\nweeks—forget about months, let alone years—because no kingpin\nwanted to be shamed in front of others, and they all wanted to\nshine in front of their peers and superiors. In the fishbowl, incompetent precinct commanders could no longer cover up their failings\nby blaming their precinct’s results on the shortcomings of neighboring precincts, because their neighbors were in the room and\ncould respond. Indeed, a picture of the precinct commander to be\ngrilled at the crime strategy meetings was printed on the front page\nof the handout, emphasizing that the commander was responsible\nand accountable for that precinct’s results.\nBy the same token, the fishbowl gave an opportunity for high\nachievers to gain recognition for work in their own precincts and in\nhelping others. The meetings also provided an opportunity for policy leaders to compare notes on their experiences; before Bratton’s\narrival, precinct commanders seldom got together as a group. Over\ntime, this style of fishbowl management filtered down the ranks, as\nOvercome Key Organizational Hurdles 163\n\nthe precinct commanders tried out their own versions of Bratton’s\nmeetings. With the spotlight shining brightly on their performance\nin strategy execution, the precinct commanders were highly motivated to get all the officers under their control marching to the new\nstrategy.\nFor this to work, however, organizations must simultaneously\nmake fair process the modus operandi. By fair process we mean engaging all the affected people in the process, explaining to them the\nbasis of decisions and the reasons people will be promoted or sidestepped in the future, and setting clear expectations of what that\nmeans to employees’ performance. At the NYPD’s crime strategy\nreview meetings, no one could argue that the playing field wasn’t\nfair. The fishbowl was applied to all kingpins. There was clear\ntransparency in the assessment of every commander’s performance\nand how it would tie into advancement or demotion, and clear expectations were set in every meeting of what was expected in performance from everyone.\nIn this way, fair process signals to people that there is a level\nplaying field and that leaders value employees’ intellectual and\nemotional worth despite all the change that may be required. This\ngreatly mitigates feelings of suspicion and doubt that are almost\nnecessarily present in employees’ minds when a company is trying\nto make a major strategic shift. The cushion of support provided\nby fair process, combined with the fishbowl emphasis on sheer\nperformance, pushes people and supports them on the journey,\ndemonstrating managers’ intellectual and emotional respect for\nemployees. (For a fuller discussion on fair process and its motivational implications, see chapter 8.)\nAtomize to Get the Organization to Change Itself\nThe last disproportionate influence factor is atomization. Atomization relates to the framing of the strategic challenge—one of the\nmost subtle and sensitive tasks of the tipping point leader. Unless\npeople believe that the strategic challenge is attainable, the change\n164 EXECUTING BLUE OCEAN ST RATE G Y\n\nis not likely to succeed. On the face of it, Bratton’s goal in New\nYork City was so ambitious as to be scarcely believable. Who could\nbelieve that anything an individual could do would turn such a\nhuge city from being the most dangerous place in the country into\nthe safest? And who would want to invest time and energy in chasing an impossible dream?\nTo make the challenge attainable, Bratton broke it into bite-size\natoms that officers at different levels could relate to. As he put it,\nthe challenge facing the NYPD was to make the streets of New\nYork City safe “block by block, precinct by precinct, and borough\nby borough.” Thus framed, the challenge was both all-encompassing and doable. For officers on the street, the challenge was to make\ntheir beat or block safe—no more. For the precinct commanders,\nthe challenge was to make their precinct safe—no more. Borough\nheads also had a concrete goal within their capabilities: making\ntheir boroughs safe—no more. No one could say that what was being\nasked of them was too tough. Nor could they claim that achieving\nit was largely out of their hands—“It’s beyond me.” In this way, responsibility for executing Bratton’s blue ocean strategy shifted\nfrom him to each of the NYPD’s thirty-six thousand officers.\nDo you indiscriminately try to motivate the masses? Or do you\nfocus on key influencers, your kingpins? Do you put the spotlight\non and manage kingpins in a fishbowl based on fair process? Or do\nyou just demand high performance and cross your fingers until the\nnext quarter numbers come out? Do you issue grand strategic visions? Or do you atomize the issue to make it actionable to all levels?\nKnock Over the Political Hurdle\nYouth and skill will win out every time over age and treachery.\nTrue or false? False. Even the best and brightest are regularly\neaten alive by politics, intrigue, and plotting. Organizational politics is an inescapable reality of corporate and public life. Even if an\norganization has reached the tipping point of execution, there\nOvercome Key Organizational Hurdles 165\n\nexist powerful vested interests that will resist the impending\nchanges. (Also see our discussion on adoption hurdles in chapter\n6.) The more likely change becomes, the more fiercely and vocally\nthese negative influencers—both internal and external—will fight\nto protect their positions, and their resistance can seriously damage and even derail the strategy execution process.\nTo overcome these political forces, tipping point leaders focus on\nthree disproportionate influence factors: leveraging angels, silencing devils, and getting a consigliere on their top management team.\nAngels are those who have the most to gain from the strategic shift.\nDevils are those who have the most to lose from it. And a consigliere\nis a politically adept but highly respected insider who knows in advance all the land mines, including who will fight you and who will\nsupport you.\nSecure a Consigliere on Your Top Management Team\nMost leaders concentrate on building a top management team having strong functional skills such as marketing, operations, and finance—and that is important. Tipping point leaders, however, also\nengage one role few other executives think to include: a consigliere.\nTo that end, Bratton, for example, always ensured that he had a respected senior insider on his top team who knew the land mines he\nwould face in implementing the new policing strategy. At NYPD,\nBratton appointed John Timoney (now the police commissioner of\nMiami) as his number two. Timoney was a cop’s cop, respected and\nfeared for his dedication to the NYPD and for the more than sixty\ndecorations and combat crosses he had received. Twenty years in\nthe ranks had taught him not only who all the key players were but\nalso how they played the political game. One of the first tasks Timoney did was to report to Bratton on the likely attitudes of the top\nstaff to the NYPD’s new policing strategy, identifying those who\nwould fight or silently sabotage the new initiative. This led to a dramatic changing of the guard.\n166 EXECUTING BLUE OCEAN ST RATE G Y\n\nLeverage Your Angels and Silence Your Devils\nTo knock down the political hurdles, you should also ask yourself\ntwo sets of questions:\n• Who are my devils? Who will fight me? Who will lose the most\nby the future blue ocean strategy?\n• Who are my angels? Who will naturally align with me? Who\nwill gain the most by the strategic shift?\nDon’t fight alone. Get the higher and wider voice to fight with\nyou. Identify your detractors and supporters—forget the middle—\nand strive to create a win-win outcome for both. But move quickly.\nIsolate your detractors by building a broader coalition with your\nangels before a battle begins. In this way, you will discourage the\nwar before it has a chance to start or gain steam.\nOne of the most serious threats to Bratton’s new policing strategy came from New York City’s courts. Believing that Bratton’s\nnew policing strategy of focusing on quality-of-life crimes would\noverwhelm the system with small crime cases such as prostitution\nand public drunkenness, the courts opposed the strategic shift. To\novercome this opposition, Bratton clearly illustrated to his supporters, including the mayor, district attorneys, and jail managers,\nthat the court system could indeed handle the added quality-of-life\ncrimes and that focusing on them would, in the long term, actually\nreduce their caseload. The mayor decided to intervene.\nThen Bratton’s coalition, led by the mayor, went on the offensive\nin the press with a clear and simple message: If the courts did not\npull their weight, the city’s crime rate would not go down. Bratton’s\nalliance with the mayor’s office and the city’s leading newspaper\nsuccessfully isolated the courts. They could hardly be seen to publicly oppose an initiative that would not only make New York a\nmore attractive place to live but would also ultimately reduce the\nnumber of cases brought before them. With the mayor speaking aggressively in the press of the need to pursue quality-of-life crimes\nOvercome Key Organizational Hurdles 167\n\nand the city’s most respected—and liberal—newspaper giving credence to the new police strategy, the costs of fighting Bratton’s\nstrategy were daunting. Bratton had won the battle: The courts would\ncomply. He also won the war: Crime rates did indeed come down.\nKey to winning over your detractors or devils is knowing all\ntheir likely angles of attack and building up counterarguments\nbacked by irrefutable facts and reason. For example, when the\nNYPD’s precinct commanders were first requested to compile detailed crime data and maps, they balked at the idea, arguing that it\nwould take too much time. Anticipating this reaction, Bratton had\nalready done a test run of the operation to see how long it would\ntake: no more than eighteen minutes a day, which worked out, as he\ntold the commanders, to less than 1 percent of their average workload. Armed with irrefutable information, he was able to tip the political hurdle and win the battle before it even began.\nDo you have a consigliere—a highly respected insider—in your\ntop management team, or only a CFO and other functional head\nheads? Do you know who will fight you and who will align with the\nnew strategy? Have you built coalitions with natural allies to encircle dissidents? Do you have your consigliere remove the biggest\nland mines so that you don’t have to focus on changing those who\ncannot and will not change?\nChallenging Conventional Wisdom\nAs shown in figure 7-3, the conventional theory of organizational\nchange rests on transforming the mass. So change efforts are focused on moving the mass, requiring steep resources and long time\nframes—luxuries few executives can afford. Tipping point leadership, by contrast, takes a reverse course. To change the mass it focuses on transforming the extremes: the people, acts, and activities\nthat exercise a disproportionate influence on performance. By\ntransforming the extremes, tipping point leaders are able to change\nthe core fast and at low cost to execute their new strategy.\n168 EXECUTING BLUE OCEAN ST RATE G Y\n\nIt is never easy to execute a strategic shift, and doing it fast with\nlimited resources is even more difficult. Yet our research suggests\nthat it can be achieved by leveraging tipping point leadership. By\nconsciously addressing the hurdles to strategy execution and focusing on factors of disproportionate influence, you too can knock\nthem over to actualize a strategic shift. Don’t follow conventional\nwisdom. Not every challenge requires a proportionate action. Focus\non acts of disproportionate influence. This is a critical leadership\ncomponent for making blue ocean strategy happen. It aligns employees’ actions with the new strategy.\nThe next chapter drills down one level further. It addresses the\nchallenge of aligning people’s minds and hearts with the new strategy by building a culture of trust, commitment, and voluntary cooperation in its execution, as well as support for the leader.\nAddressing this challenge spells the difference between forced execution and voluntary execution driven by people’s free will.\nOvercome Key Organizational Hurdles 169\nFIGURE 7-3\nConventional Wisdom Versus Tipping Point Leadership\nExtremes\nCompany\nExtremes\nTheory of organization change rests on transforming the mass.

A company is everyone\nfrom the top to the front lines. And it is only when all the members\nof an organization are aligned around a strategy and support it, for\nbetter or for worse, that a company stands apart as a great and consistent executor. Overcoming the organizational hurdles to strategy execution is an important step toward that end. It removes the\nroadblocks that can put a halt to even the best of strategies.\nBut in the end, a company needs to invoke the most fundamental\nbase of action: the attitudes and behavior of its people deep in the\norganization. You must create a culture of trust and commitment\nthat motivates people to execute the agreed strategy—not to the\nletter, but to the spirit. People’s minds and hearts must align with\nthe new strategy so that at the level of the individual, people embrace it of their own accord and willingly go beyond compulsory\nexecution to voluntary cooperation in carrying it out.\nWhere blue ocean strategy is concerned, this challenge is heightened. Trepidation builds as people are required to step out of their\ncomfort zones and change how they have worked in the past. They\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n\nwonder, What are the real reasons for this change? Is top management honest when it speaks of building future growth through a\nchange in strategic course? Or are they trying to make us redundant and work us out of our jobs?\nThe more removed people are from the top and the less they have\nbeen involved in the creation of the strategy, the more this trepidation builds. On the front line, at the very level at which a strategy\nmust be executed day in and day out, people can resent having a\nstrategy thrust upon them with little regard for what they think\nand feel. Just when you think you have done everything right,\nthings can suddenly go very wrong in your front line.\nThis brings us to the sixth principle of blue ocean strategy: To\nbuild people’s trust and commitment deep in the ranks and inspire\ntheir voluntary cooperation, companies need to build execution\ninto strategy from the start. That principle allows companies to\nminimize the management risk of distrust, noncooperation, and\neven sabotage. This management risk is relevant to strategy execution in both red and blue oceans, but it is greater for blue ocean\nstrategy because its execution often requires significant change.\nHence, minimizing such risk is essential as companies execute blue\nocean strategy. Companies must reach beyond the usual suspects of\ncarrots and sticks. They must reach to fair process in the making\nand executing of strategy.\nOur research shows that fair process is a key variable that distinguishes successful blue ocean strategic moves from those that\nfailed. The presence or absence of fair process can make or break a\ncompany’s best execution efforts.\nPoor Process Can Ruin Strategy Execution\nConsider the experience of a global leader in supplying waterbased liquid coolants for metalworking industries. We’ll call this\norganization Lubber. Because of the many processing parameters\nin metal-based manufacturing, there are several hundred complex\n172 EXECUTING BLUE OCEAN ST RATE G Y\n\ntypes of coolants to choose from. Choosing the right coolant is a\ndelicate process. Products must first be tested on production machines before purchasing, and the decision often rests on fuzzy\nlogic. The result is machine downtime and sampling costs, and\nthese are expensive for customers and Lubber alike.\nTo offer customers a leap in value, Lubber devised a strategy to\neliminate the complexity and costs of the trial phase. Using artificial intelligence, it developed an expert system that cut the failure\nrate in selecting coolants to less than 10 percent from an industry\naverage of 50 percent. The system also reduced machine downtime,\neased coolant management, and raised the overall quality of work\npieces produced. As for Lubber, the sales process was dramatically\nsimplified, giving sales representatives more time to gain new sales\nand dropping the costs per sale.\nThis win-win value innovation strategic move, however, was\ndoomed from the start. It wasn’t that the strategy was not good or\nthat the expert system did not work; it worked exceptionally well.\nThe strategy was doomed because the sales force fought it.\nHaving not been engaged in the strategy-making process nor apprised of the rationale for the strategic shift, sales reps saw the expert system in a light no one on the design team or management\nteam had ever imagined. To them, it was a direct threat to what\nthey saw as their most valuable contribution—tinkering in the trial\nphase to find the right water-based coolant from the long list of\npossible candidates. All the wonderful benefits—having a way to\navoid the hassle-filled part of their job, having more time to pull in\nmore sales, and winning more contracts by standing out in the industry—went unappreciated.\nWith the sales force feeling threatened and often working\nagainst the expert system by expressing doubts about its effectiveness to customers, sales did not take off. After cursing its hubris\nand learning the hard way the importance of dealing with managerial risk up front based on the proper process, management was\nforced to pull the expert system from the market and work on rebuilding trust with its sales representatives.\nBuild Execution into Strategy 173\n\nThe Power of Fair Process\nWhat, then, is fair process? And how does it allow companies to\nbuild execution into strategy? The theme of fairness or justice has\npreoccupied writers and philosophers throughout the ages. But the\ndirect theoretical origin of fair process traces back to two social\nscientists: John W. Thibaut and Laurens Walker. In the mid-1970s,\nthey combined their interest in the psychology of justice with the\nstudy of process, creating the term procedural justice.\n1 Focusing\ntheir attention on legal settings, they sought to understand what\nmakes people trust a legal system so that they will comply with\nlaws without being coerced. Their research established that people\n174 EXECUTING BLUE OCEAN ST RATE G Y\nFIGURE 8-1\nHow Fair Process Affects People’s Attitudes and Behavior\nFair Process\nEngagement\nExplanation\nExpectation clarity\nStrategy\nFormulation\nProcess\nAttitudes\nBehavior\nStrategy\nExecution\nTrust and\nCommitment\n“I feel my\nopinion counts.”\nVoluntary\nCooperation\n“I’ll go beyond\nthe call of duty.”\nExceeds\nExpectations\nSelf-initiated\n\ncare as much about the justice of the process through which an\noutcome is produced as they do about the outcome itself. People’s\nsatisfaction with the outcome and their commitment to it rose\nwhen procedural justice was exercised.2\nFair process is our managerial expression of procedural justice\ntheory. As in legal settings, fair process builds execution into strategy by creating people’s buy-in up front. When fair process is exercised in the strategy-making process, people trust that a level\nplaying field exists. This inspires them to cooperate voluntarily in\nexecuting the resulting strategic decisions.\nVoluntary cooperation is more than mechanical execution, where\npeople do only what it takes to get by. It involves going beyond the\ncall of duty, wherein individuals exert energy and initiative to the\nbest of their abilities—even subordinating personal self-interest—\nto execute resulting strategies.3 Figure 8-1 presents the causal flow\nwe observed among fair process, attitudes, and behavior.\nThe Three E Principles of Fair Process\nThere are three mutually reinforcing elements that define fair\nprocess: engagement, explanation, and clarity of expectation.\nWhether people are senior executives or shop floor employees, they\nall look to these elements. We call them the three E principles of\nfair process.\nEngagement means involving individuals in the strategic decisions that affect them by asking for their input and allowing them\nto refute the merits of one another’s ideas and assumptions. Engagement communicates management’s respect for individuals and\ntheir ideas. Encouraging refutation sharpens everyone’s thinking\nand builds better collective wisdom. Engagement results in better\nstrategic decisions by management and greater commitment from\nall involved to execute those decisions.\nExplanation means that everyone involved and affected should\nunderstand why final strategic decisions are made as they are. An\nBuild Execution into Strategy 175\n\nexplanation of the thinking that underlies decisions makes people\nconfident that managers have considered their opinions and have\nmade decisions impartially in the overall interests of the company.\nAn explanation allows employees to trust managers’ intentions\neven if their own ideas have been rejected. It also serves as a powerful feedback loop that enhances learning.\nExpectation clarity requires that after a strategy is set, managers\nstate clearly the new rules of the game. Although the expectations\nmay be demanding, employees should know up front what standards\nthey will be judged by and the penalties for failure. What are the goals\nof the new strategy? What are the new targets and milestones?\nWho is responsible for what? To achieve fair process, it matters less\nwhat the new goals, expectations, and responsibilities are and more\nthat they are clearly understood. When people clearly understand\nwhat is expected of them, political jockeying and favoritism are\nminimized, and people can focus on executing the strategy rapidly.\nTaken together, these three criteria collectively lead to judgments of fair process. This is important, because any subset of the\nthree does not create judgments of fair process.\nA Tale of Two Plants\nHow do the three E principles of fair process work to affect strategy execution deep in an organization? Consider the experience of\nan elevator systems manufacturer we’ll call Elco. In the late 1980s,\nsales in the elevator industry declined. Excess office space left\nsome large U.S. cities with vacancy rates as high as 20 percent.\nWith domestic demand falling, Elco set out to offer buyers a leap\nin value while lowering its costs to stimulate new demand and\nbreak from the competition. In its quest to create and execute a\nblue ocean strategy, the company realized that it needed to replace\nits batch-manufacturing system with a cellular approach that\nwould allow self-directed teams to achieve superior performance.\nThe management team was in agreement and ready to go. To exe176 EXECUTING BLUE OCEAN ST RATE G Y\n\ncute this key element of its strategy, the team adopted what looked\nlike the fastest and smartest way to move forward.\nIt would first install the new system at Elco’s Chester plant and\nthen roll it out to its second plant, High Park. The logic was simple.\nThe Chester plant had exemplary employee relations, so much so\nthat the workers had decertified their own union. Management was\ncertain it could count on employee cooperation to execute the\nstrategic shift in manufacturing. In the company’s words, “They\nwere the ideal work force.” Next, Elco would roll out the process to\nits plant in High Park, where a strong union was expected to resist\nthat, or any other, change. Management was counting on having\nachieved a degree of momentum for execution at Chester that it\nhoped would have positive spillover effects on High Park.\nThe theory was good. In practice, however, things took an unpredicted turn. The introduction of the new manufacturing process at\nthe Chester plant quickly led to disorder and rebellion. Within a\nfew months, both cost and quality performance were in free fall.\nEmployees were talking about bringing back the union. Having\nlost control, the despairing plant manager called Elco’s industrial\npsychologist for help.\nIn contrast, the High Park plant, despite its reputation for resistance, had accepted the strategic shift in the manufacturing process. Every day, the High Park manager waited for the anticipated\nmeltdown, but it never came. Even when people didn’t like the decisions, they felt they had been treated fairly, and so they willingly\nparticipated in the rapid execution of the new manufacturing\nprocess, a pivotal component of the company’s new strategy.\nA closer look at the way the strategic shift was made at the two\nplants reveals the reasons behind this apparent anomaly. At the\nChester plant, Elco managers violated all three of the basic principles of fair process. First, they failed to engage employees in the\nstrategic decisions that directly affected them. Lacking expertise\nin cellular manufacturing, Elco brought in a consulting firm to design a master plan for the conversion. The consultants were briefed\nto work quickly and with minimal disturbance to employees so that\nBuild Execution into Strategy 177\n\nfast, painless implementation could be achieved. The consultants\nfollowed the instructions. When Chester employees arrived at work\nthey discovered strangers at the plant who not only dressed differently—wearing dark suits, white shirts, and ties—but also spoke in\nlow tones to one another. To minimize disturbance, they didn’t interact with employees. Instead they quietly hovered behind people’s\nbacks, taking notes and drawing diagrams. The rumor circulated\nthat after employees went home in the afternoon, these same people would swarm across the plant floor, snoop around people’s\nworkstations, and have heated discussions.\nDuring this period, the plant manager was increasingly absent.\nHe was spending more time at Elco’s head office in meetings with\nthe consultants—sessions deliberately scheduled away from the\nplant so as not to distract the employees. But the plant manager’s\nabsence produced the opposite effect. As people grew anxious, wondering why the captain of their ship seemed to be deserting them,\nthe rumor mill moved into high gear. Everyone became convinced\nthat the consultants would downsize the plant. They were sure they\nwere about to lose their jobs. The fact that the plant manager was\nalways gone without any explanation—obviously, he was avoiding\nthem—could only mean that management was, they thought, “trying to put one over on us.” Trust and commitment at the Chester\nplant deteriorated quickly.\nSoon, people were bringing in newspaper clippings about other\nplants around the country that had been shut down with the help of\nconsultants. Employees saw themselves as imminent victims of management’s hidden intention to downsize and work people out of their\njobs. In fact, Elco managers had no intention of closing the plant.\nThey wanted to cut waste, freeing people to produce higher-quality\nelevators faster at lower cost to leapfrog the competition. But plant\nemployees could not have known that.\nManagers at Chester also didn’t explain why strategic decisions\nwere being made the way they were and what those decisions meant\nto employees’ careers and work methods. Management unveiled the\nmaster plan for change in a thirty-minute session with employees.\n178 EXECUTING BLUE OCEAN ST RATE G Y\n\nThe audience heard that their time-honored way of working would\nbe abolished and replaced by something called “cellular manufacturing.” No one explained why the strategic shift was needed, how the\ncompany needed to break away from the competition to stimulate\nnew demand, and why the shift in the manufacturing process was a\nkey element of that strategy. Employees sat in stunned silence, with\nno understanding of the rationale behind the change. The managers\nmistook this for acceptance, forgetting how long it had taken them\nover the preceding few months to get comfortable with the idea of\nshifting to cellular manufacturing to execute the new strategy.\nMaster plan in hand, management quickly began rearranging\nthe plant. When employees asked what the new layout aimed to\nachieve, the response was “efficiency gains.” The managers didn’t\nhave time to explain why efficiency had to be improved and didn’t want\nto worry employees. But lacking an intellectual understanding of\nwhat was happening to them, some employees began feeling sick as\nthey came to work.\nManagers also neglected to make clear what would be expected\nof employees under the new manufacturing process. They informed\nemployees that they would no longer be judged on individual performance but rather on the performance of the cell. They said that\nfaster or more experienced employees would have to pick up the\nslack for slower or less experienced colleagues. But they didn’t\nelaborate. How the new cellular system was supposed to work, managers didn’t make clear.\nViolations of the principles of fair process undermined employees’\ntrust in the strategic shift and in management. In fact, the new cell design offered tremendous benefits to employees—for example, making vacations easier to schedule and giving them the opportunity to\nbroaden their skills and engage in a greater variety of work. Yet employees could see only its negative side. They began taking out their\nfear and anger on one another. Fights erupted on the plant floor as\nemployees refused to help those they called “lazy people who can’t\nfinish their own jobs” or interpreted offers of help as meddling, responding with, “This is my job. You keep to your own workstation.”\nBuild Execution into Strategy 179\n\nChester’s model work force was falling apart. For the first time in\nthe plant manager’s career, employees refused to do as they were\nasked, turning down assignments “even if you fire me.” They felt\nthey could no longer trust the once popular plant manager, so they\nbegan to go around him, taking their complaints directly to his\nboss at the head office. In the absence of fair process, the Chester\nplant’s employees rejected the transformation and refused to play\ntheir role in executing the new strategy.\nIn contrast, management at the High Park plant abided by all\nthree principles of fair process when introducing the strategic shift.\nWhen the consultants came to the plant, the plant manager introduced them to all employees. Management engaged employees by\nholding a series of plantwide meetings, where corporate executives\nopenly discussed the declining business conditions and the company’s need for a change in strategic course to break from the competition and simultaneously achieve higher value at lower cost. They\nexplained that they had visited other companies’ plants and had\nseen the productivity improvements that cellular manufacturing\ncould bring. They explained how this would be a pivotal determinant of the company’s ability to achieve its new strategy. They announced a proaction-time policy to calm employees’ justifiable\nfears of layoffs. As old performance measures were discarded, managers worked with employees to develop new ones and to establish\neach cell team’s new responsibilities. Goals and expectations were\nmade clear to employees.\nBy practicing the three principles of fair process in tandem,\nmanagement won the understanding and support of High Park employees. The employees spoke of their plant manager with admiration, and they commiserated with the difficulties Elco’s managers\nhad in executing the new strategy and making the changeover to\ncellular manufacturing. They concluded that it had been a necessary, worthwhile, and positive experience.\nElco’s managers still regard this experience as one of the most\npainful in their careers. They learned that people in the front line\n180 EXECUTING BLUE OCEAN ST RATE G Y\n\ncare as much about the proper process as those at the top. By violating fair process in making and rolling out strategies, managers\ncan turn their best employees into their worst, earning their distrust of and resistance to the very strategy they depend on them to\nexecute. But if managers practice fair process, the worst employees\ncan turn into the best and can execute even difficult strategic shifts\nwith their willing commitment while building their trust.\nWhy Does Fair Process Matter?\nWhy is fair process important in shaping people’s attitudes and behavior? Specifically, why does the observance or violation of fair\nprocess in strategy making have the power to make or break a strategy’s execution? It all comes down to intellectual and emotional\nrecognition.\nEmotionally, individuals seek recognition of their value, not as\n“labor,” “personnel,” or “human resources” but as human beings who\nare treated with full respect and dignity and appreciated for their\nindividual worth regardless of hierarchical level. Intellectually, individuals seek recognition that their ideas are sought after and\ngiven thoughtful reflection, and that others think enough of their\nintelligence to explain their thinking to them. Such frequently\ncited expressions in our interviews as “that goes for everyone I\nknow” or “every person wants to feel” and constant references to\n“people” and “human beings” reinforce the point that managers\nmust see the nearly universal value of the intellectual and emotional recognition that fair process conveys.\nIntellectual and Emotional Recognition Theory\nUsing fair process in strategy making is strongly linked to both intellectual and emotional recognition. It proves through action that\nBuild Execution into Strategy 181\n\nthere is an eagerness to trust and cherish the individual as well as a\ndeep-seated confidence in the individual’s knowledge, talents, and\nexpertise.\nWhen individuals feel recognized for their intellectual worth,\nthey are willing to share their knowledge; in fact, they feel inspired\nto impress and confirm the expectation of their intellectual value,\nsuggesting active ideas and knowledge sharing. Similarly, when individuals are treated with emotional recognition, they feel emotionally tied to the strategy and inspired to give their all. Indeed, in\nFrederick Herzberg’s classic study on motivation, recognition was\nfound to inspire strong intrinsic motivation, causing people to go\nbeyond the call of duty and engage in voluntary cooperation.4\nHence, to the extent that fair process judgments convey intellectual and emotional recognition, people will better apply their\nknowledge and expertise, as well as their voluntary efforts to cooperate for the organization’s success in executing strategy.\nHowever, there is a flip side to this that is deserving of equal, if\nnot more, attention: the violation of fair process and, with it, the violation of recognizing individuals’ intellectual and emotional\nworth. The observed pattern of thought and behavior can be summarized as follows. If individuals are not treated as though their\nknowledge is valued, they will feel intellectual indignation and\nwill not share their ideas and expertise; rather, they will hoard\ntheir best thinking and creative ideas, preventing new insights\nfrom seeing the light of day. What’s more, they will reject others’\nintellectual worth as well. It’s as if they were saying, “You don’t\nvalue my ideas. So I don’t value your ideas, nor do I trust in or care\nabout the strategic decisions you’ve reached.”\nSimilarly, to the extent that people’s emotional worth is not recognized, they will feel angry and will not invest their energy in\ntheir actions; rather, they will drag their feet and apply counterefforts, including sabotage, as in the case of Elco’s Chester plant.\nThis often leads employees to push for rolling back strategies that\nhave been imposed unfairly, even when the strategies themselves\nwere good ones—critical to the company’s success or beneficial to\n182 EXECUTING BLUE OCEAN ST RATE G Y\n\nemployees and managers themselves. Lacking trust in the strategymaking process, people lack trust in the resulting strategies. Such\nis the emotional power that fair process can provoke. Figure 8-2\nshows the observed causal pattern.\nFair Process and Blue Ocean Strategy\nCommitment, trust, and voluntary cooperation are not merely attitudes or behaviors. They are intangible capital. When people have\ntrust, they have heightened confidence in one another’s intentions\nand actions. When they have commitment, they are even willing to\noverride personal self-interest in the interests of the company.\nIf you ask any company that has created and successfully executed a blue ocean strategy, managers will be quick to rattle off\nhow important this intangible capital is to their success. Similarly,\nmanagers from companies that have failed in executing blue ocean\nstrategies will point out that the lack of this capital contributed to\ntheir failure. These companies were not able to orchestrate strategic shifts because they lacked people’s trust and commitment. Commitment, trust, and voluntary cooperation allow companies to\nBuild Execution into Strategy 183\nFIGURE 8-2\nThe Execution Consequences of the Presence and\nAbsence of Fair Process in Strategy Making\nFair\nProcess\nIntellectual\nand Emotional\nRecognition\nTrust and\nCommitment\nVoluntary\nCooperation in\nStrategy\nExecution\nViolation of\nFair Process\nIntellectual\nand Emotional\nIndignation\nDistrust and\nResentment\nRefusal to\nExecute\nStrategy\n\nstand apart in the speed, quality, and consistency of their execution and to implement strategic shifts fast at low cost.\nThe question companies wrestle with is how to create trust, commitment, and voluntary cooperation deep in the organization. You\ndon’t do it by separating strategy formulation from execution. Although this disconnect may be a hallmark of most companies’ practice, it is also a hallmark of slow and questionable implementation,\nand mechanical follow-through at best. Of course, traditional incentives of power and money—carrots and sticks—help. But they\nfall short of inspiring human behavior that goes beyond outcomedriven self-interest. Where behavior cannot be monitored with certainty, there is still plenty of room for foot-dragging and sabotage.\nThe exercise of fair process gets around this dilemma. By organizing the strategy formulation process around the principles of fair\nprocess, you can build execution into strategy making from the\nstart. With fair process, people tend to be committed to support the\nresulting strategy even when it is viewed as not favorable or at odds\nwith their perception of what is strategically correct for their unit.\nPeople realize that compromises and sacrifices are necessary in\nbuilding a strong company. They accept the need for short-term\npersonal sacrifices in order to advance the long-term interests of\nthe corporation. This acceptance is conditional, however, on the\npresence of fair process. Whatever the context in which a company’s blue ocean strategy is executed—be it working with a joint\nventure partner to outsource component manufacturing, reorienting the sales force, transforming the manufacturing process, relocating a company’s call center from the United States to India—we\nhave consistently observed this dynamic at work.\n184 EXECUTING BLUE OCEAN ST RATE G Y\n\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\nC HAPTER 9\nConclusion: The Sustainability and\nRenewal of Blue Ocean Strategy\nCREATING BLUE OCEANS is not a static achievement\nbut a dynamic process. Once a company creates a blue\nocean and its powerful performance consequences are known,\nsooner or later imitators appear on the horizon. The question is,\nHow soon or late will they come? Put differently, how easy or difficult is blue ocean strategy to imitate?\nAs the company and its early imitators succeed and expand the\nblue ocean, more companies eventually jump in. This raises a related question: When should a company reach out to create another blue ocean? In this concluding chapter, we address the issues\nof the sustainability and renewal of blue ocean strategy.\nBarriers to Imitation\nA blue ocean strategy brings with it considerable barriers to imitation. Some of these are operational, and others are cognitive. More\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n\noften than not, a blue ocean strategy will go without credible challenges for ten to fifteen years, as was the case with Cirque du Soleil,\nSouthwest Airlines, Federal Express, The Home Depot, Bloomberg,\nand CNN, for starters. This sustainability can be traced to the following imitation barriers rooted in blue ocean strategy:\n• A value innovation move does not make sense based on\nconventional strategic logic. When CNN was introduced,\nfor example, NBC, CBS, and ABC ridiculed the idea of\ntwenty-four-hour, seven-day, real-time news without star\nbroadcasters. CNN was referred to as Chicken Noodle\nNews by the industry. Ridicule does not inspire rapid\nimitation.\n• Brand image conflict prevents companies from imitating a\nblue ocean strategy. The blue ocean strategy of The Body\nShop, for example—which shunned beautiful models, promises of eternal beauty and youth, and expensive packaging—\nleft major cosmetic houses the world over actionless for\nyears because imitation would signal an invalidation of\ntheir current business models.\n• Natural monopoly blocks imitation when the size of a market\ncannot support another player. For example, the Belgian\ncinema company Kinepolis created the first megaplex in\nEurope in the city of Brussels and has not been imitated in\nmore than fifteen years despite its enormous success. The\nreason is that the size of Brussels could not support a second\nmegaplex, which would cause both Kinepolis and its imitator\nto suffer.\n• Patents or legal permits block imitation.\n• The high volume generated by a value innovation leads to\nrapid cost advantages, placing potential imitators at an\nongoing cost disadvantage. The huge economies of scale in\npurchasing enjoyed by Wal-Mart, for example, have signifi186 EXECUTING BLUE OCEAN ST RATE G Y\n\ncantly discouraged other companies from imitating its blue\nocean strategy.\n• Network externalities also block companies from easily and\ncredibly imitating a blue ocean strategy, much as eBay enjoys\nin the online auction market. In short, the more customers\neBay has online, the more attractive the auction site becomes\nfor both sellers and buyers of wares, creating scant incentive\nfor buyers to switch to a potential imitator.\n• Because imitation often requires companies to make substantial changes to their existing business practices, politics\noften kick in, delaying for years a company’s commitment to\nimitate a blue ocean strategy. When Southwest Airlines, for\nexample, created a service that offered the speed of air travel\nwith the cost and flexibility of driving, imitating this blue\nocean strategy would have meant major revisions in routing\nplanes, retraining staff, and changing marketing and pricing,\nnot to mention culture—significant changes that the politics\nof few companies can bear in the short term.\n• When a company offers a leap in value, it rapidly earns brand\nbuzz and a loyal following in the marketplace. Even large\nadvertising budgets by an aggressive imitator rarely have the\nstrength to overtake the brand buzz earned by the value innovator. Microsoft, for example, has been trying for years to dislodge Intuit’s value innovation, Quicken. More than ten years\nout, despite all its efforts and investment, it has not been able\nto do so.\nFigure 9-1 provides a snapshot of these barriers to imitation. As\nthe figure shows, the barriers are high. This is why we have seldom\nobserved rapid imitation of blue ocean strategy. In addition, blue\nocean strategy is a systems approach that requires not only getting\neach strategic element right but also aligning them in an integral\nsystem to deliver value innovation. Imitating such a system is not\nan easy feat.\nThe Sustainability and Renewal of Blue Ocean Strategy 187\n\nWhen to Value-Innovate Again\nEventually, however, almost every blue ocean strategy will be imitated. As imitators try to grab a share of your blue ocean, you typically launch offenses to defend your hard-earned customer base.\nBut imitators often persist. Obsessed with hanging on to market\nshare, you may fall into the trap of competing, racing to beat the\nnew competition. Over time, the competition, and not the buyer,\nmay come to occupy the center of your strategic thought and actions. If you stay on this course, the basic shape of your value curve\nwill begin to converge with those of the competition.\nTo avoid the trap of competing, you need to monitor value curves\non the strategy canvas. Monitoring value curves signals when to\nvalue-innovate and when not to. It alerts you to reach out for another blue ocean when your value curve begins to converge with\nthose of the competition.\nIt also keeps you from pursuing another blue ocean when there\nis still a huge profit stream to be collected from your current offering. When the company’s value curve still has focus, divergence,\nand a compelling tagline, you should resist the temptation to valueinnovate again and instead should focus on lengthening, widening,\nand deepening your rent stream through operational improvements\n188 EXECUTING BLUE OCEAN ST RATE G Y\nFIGURE 9-1\nImitation Barriers to Blue Ocean Strategy\n• Value innovation does not make sense to a company’s conventional logic.\n• Blue ocean strategy may conflict with other companies’ brand image.\n• Natural monopoly: The market often cannot support a second player.\n• Patents or legal permits block imitation.\n• High volume leads to rapid cost advantage for the value innovator, discouraging\nfollowers from entering the market.\n• Network externalities discourage imitation.\n• Imitation often requires significant political, operational, and cultural changes.\n• Companies that value-innovate earn brand buzz and a loyal customer following that\ntends to shun imitators.\n\nand geographical expansion to achieve maximum economies of\nscale and market coverage. You should swim as far as possible in\nthe blue ocean, making yourself a moving target, distancing yourself from your early imitators, and discouraging them in the\nprocess. The aim here is to dominate the blue ocean over your imitators for as long as possible.\nAs rivalry intensifies and total supply exceeds demand, bloody\ncompetition commences and the ocean will turn red. As competitors’ value curves converge toward yours, you should begin reaching out for another value innovation to create a new blue ocean.\nHence, by charting your value curve on the strategy canvas and intermittently replotting your competitors’ value curves versus your\nown, you will be able to visually see the degree of imitation, and\nhence of value curve convergence and the extent to which your\nblue ocean is turning red.\nThe Body Shop, for example, dominated the blue ocean it had\ncreated for more than a decade. The company, however, is now in\nthe middle of a bloody red ocean, with declining performance. It\ndid not reach out for another value innovation when competitors’\nvalue curves converged with its own. Similarly, [yellow tail] is\nswimming in the clear blue waters of new market space. It has\nmade the competition irrelevant and is enjoying strong, profitable\ngrowth as a result. However, the test of Casella Wines’ long-run\nprofitable growth will be its ability to value-innovate again when\nimitators compete both aggressively and credibly with converging\nvalue curves.\nThe six principles of blue ocean strategy proposed in this book\nshould serve as essential pointers for every company thinking\nabout its future strategy if it aspires to lead the increasingly overcrowded business world. This is not to suggest that companies will\nsuddenly stop competing or that the competition will suddenly\ncome to a halt. On the contrary, the competition will be more present and will remain a critical factor of the market reality. What\nwe suggest is that to obtain high performance in this overcrowded\nmarket, companies should go beyond competing for share to creating blue oceans.\nThe Sustainability and Renewal of Blue Ocean Strategy 189\n\nBecause blue and red oceans have always coexisted however,\npractical reality demands that companies succeed in both oceans\nand master the strategies for both. But because companies already\nunderstand how to compete in red oceans, what they need to learn\nis how to make the competition irrelevant. This book aims to help\nbalance the scales so that formulating and executing blue ocean\nstrategy can become as systematic and actionable as competing in\nthe red oceans of known market space.\n190 EXECUTING BLUE OCEAN ST RATE G Y\n\nAPPENDIX A\nA Sketch of the Historical\nPattern of Blue Ocean Creation\nAT THE RISK OF OVERSIMPLI FICATION, here we present a snapshot overview of the history of three\nAmerican industries—automobiles, computers, and movie theaters—\nfrom the perspective of major product and service offerings that\nopened new market space and generated significant new demand.\nThis review intends to be neither comprehensive in its coverage nor\nexhaustive in its content. Its aim is limited to identifying the common strategic elements across key blue ocean offerings. U.S. industries are chosen here because they represent the largest and least\nregulated free market during our study period.\nAlthough the review is only a sketch of the historical pattern of\nblue ocean creation, several patterns stand out across these three\nrepresentative industries.\n• There is no permanently excellent industry. The attractiveness of all industries rose and fell over the study period.\n• There are no permanently excellent companies. Companies,\nlike industries, rose and fell over time. These first two findings\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n\nboth confirm and add further evidence that permanently excellent companies and industries do not exist.\n• A key determinant of whether an industry or a company was\non a rising trajectory of strong, profitable growth was the\nstrategic move of blue ocean creation. The creation of blue\noceans was a key catalyst in setting an industry on an upward\ngrowth and profit trajectory. It was also a pivotal determinant\ndriving a company’s rise in profitable growth, as well as its\nfall when another company gained the lead and created a new\nblue ocean.\n• Blue oceans were created by both industry incumbents and\nnew entrants, challenging the lore that start-ups have natural\nadvantages over established companies in creating new market space. Moreover, the blue oceans created by incumbents\nwere usually within their core businesses. In fact, most blue\noceans are created from within, not beyond, red oceans of\nexisting boundaries. Issues of perceived cannibalization or\ncreative destruction for established companies proved to be\nexaggerated.1 Blue oceans created profitable growth for every\ncompany launching them, start-ups and incumbents alike.\n• The creation of blue oceans was not about technology innovation per se. Sometimes leading edge technology was present,\nbut often it was not a defining feature of blue oceans. This\nwas true even when the industry under examination was technology intensive, such as computers. Rather, the key defining\nfeature of blue oceans was value innovation—innovation that\nwas linked to what buyers value.\n• The creation of blue oceans did more than contribute to\nstrong, profitable growth; this strategic move exercised a\nstrong, positive effect on establishing a company’s standing\nbrand name in buyers’ minds.\nLet’s now turn to these three representative industries to let\nthe history of blue ocean creation speak for itself. Here we begin\n192 Appendix A\n\nwith the auto industry, a central form of transportation in the developed world.\nThe Automobile Industry\nThe U.S. auto industry dates back to 1893, when the Duryea brothers\nlaunched the first one-cylinder auto in the United States. At the\ntime, the horse and buggy was the primary means of U.S. transportation. Soon after the auto’s U.S. debut, there were hundreds of auto\nmanufacturers building custom-made automobiles in the country.\nThe autos of the time were a luxurious novelty. One model even\noffered electric curlers in the back seat for on-the-go primping.\nThey were unreliable and expensive, costing around $1,500, twice\nthe average annual family income. And they were enormously unpopular. Anticar activists tore up roads, ringed parked cars with\nbarbed wire, and organized boycotts of car-driving businessmen and\npoliticians. Public resentment of the automobile was so great that\neven future president Woodrow Wilson weighed in, saying, “Nothing has spread socialistic feeling more than the automobile . . . a\npicture of the arrogance of wealth.”2 Literary Digest suggested,\n“The ordinary ‘horseless carriage’ is at present a luxury for the\nwealthy; and although its price will probably fall in the future, it\nwill never, of course, come into as common use as the bicycle.”3\nThe industry, in short, was small and unattractive. Henry Ford,\nhowever, didn’t believe it had to be this way.\nThe Model T\nIn 1908, while America’s five hundred automakers built custommade novelty automobiles, Henry Ford introduced the Model T. He\ncalled it the car “for the great multitude, constructed of the best\nmaterials.” Although it came in only one color (black) and one\nmodel, the Model T was reliable, durable, and easy to fix. And it\nwas priced so that the majority of Americans could afford one. In\nAppendix A 193\n\n1908 the first Model T cost $850, half the price of existing automobiles. In 1909 it dropped to $609, and by 1924 it was down to $290.4\nIn comparison, the price of a horse-driven carriage, the car’s closest alternative at the time, was around $400. A 1909 sales brochure\nproclaimed, “Watch the Ford Go By, High Priced Quality in a Low\nPriced Car.”\nFord’s success was underpinned by a profitable business model.\nBy keeping the cars highly standardized and offering limited options and interchangeable parts, Ford’s revolutionary assembly\nline replaced skilled craftsmen with ordinary unskilled laborers\nwho worked one small task faster and more efficiently, cutting the\ntime to make a Model T from twenty-one days to four days and cutting labor hours by 60 percent.5 With lower costs, Ford was able to\ncharge a price that was accessible to the mass market.\nSales of the Model T exploded. Ford’s market share surged from\n9 percent in 1908 to 61 percent in 1921, and by 1923, a majority of\nAmerican households owned an automobile.6 Ford’s Model T exploded the size of the automobile industry, creating a huge blue\nocean. So great was the blue ocean Ford created that the Model T\nreplaced the horse-drawn carriage as the primary means of transport in the United States.\nGeneral Motors\nBy 1924, the car had become an essential household item, and the\nwealth of the average American household had grown. That year\nGeneral Motors (GM) unveiled a line of automobiles that would\ncreate a new blue ocean in the auto industry. In contrast to Ford’s\nfunctional, one-color, single-model strategy, GM introduced “a car\nfor every purse and purpose”—a strategy devised by chairman Alfred Sloan to appeal to the emotional dimensions of the U.S. mass\nmarket, or what Sloan called the “mass-class” market.7\nWhereas Ford stuck with the functional “horseless carriage”\nconcept of the car, GM made the car fun, exciting, comfortable, and\nfashionable. GM factories pumped out a broad array of models,\n194 Appendix A\n\nwith new colors and styles updated every year. The “annual car\nmodel” created new demand as buyers began to trade up for fashion\nand comfort. Because cars were replaced more frequently, the used\ncar market was also formed.\nDemand for GM’s fashionable and emotionally charged cars\nsoared. From 1926 to 1950, the total number of cars sold in the\nUnited States increased from two million to seven million a year,\nand General Motors increased its overall market share from 20 percent to 50 percent, while Ford’s fell from 50 percent to 20 percent.8\nBut the rapid growth in the U.S. auto industry unleashed by this\nnew blue ocean could not last forever. Following GM’s surging success, Ford and Chrysler jumped into the blue ocean GM had created, and the Big Three pursued the common strategy of launching\nnew car models yearly and hitting an emotional chord with consumers by building a wide range of car styles to meet various\nlifestyles and needs. Slowly, bloody competition began as the Big\nThree imitated and matched one another’s strategies. Collectively,\nthey captured more than 90 percent of the U.S. auto market.9 A period of complacency set in.\nSmall, Fuel-Efficient Japanese Cars\nThe auto industry, however, did not stand still. In the 1970s, the\nJapanese created a new blue ocean, challenging the U.S. automobile industry with small, efficient cars. Instead of following\nthe implicit industry logic “the bigger, the better” and focusing on\nluxuries, the Japanese altered the conventional logic, pursuing\nruthless quality, small size, and the new utility of highly gasefficient cars.\nWhen the oil crisis occurred in the 1970s, U.S. consumers flocked\nto fuel-efficient, robust Japanese cars made by Honda, Toyota,\nand Nissan (then called Datsun). Almost overnight the Japanese\nbecame heroes in consumers’ minds. Their compact, fuel-efficient\ncars created a new blue ocean of opportunity, and again demand\nsoared.\nAppendix A 195\n\nWith the Big Three focused on benchmarking and matching one\nanother, none had taken the initiative to produce functional, compact, fuel-efficient cars, even though they did see the market potential for such vehicles. Hence, instead of creating a new blue ocean,\nthe Big Three were dragged into a new round of competitive benchmarking, only this time with the Japanese; they began to invest\nheavily in the production of smaller, fuel-efficient vehicles.\nNevertheless, the Big Three were still hit by a dive in car sales, with\naggregate losses mounting to $4 billion in 1980.10 Chrysler, the little\nbrother among the Big Three, suffered the hardest hit and narrowly\nescaped bankruptcy by virtue of a government bailout. The Japanese car producers had been so effective at creating and capturing\nthis blue ocean that the U.S. automakers found it hard to make a\nreal comeback; their competitiveness and long-run viability were\nthrown into serious question by industry experts across the world.\nChrysler’s Minivan\nFast-forward to 1984. A beleaguered Chrysler, on the edge of bankruptcy, unveiled the minivan, creating a new blue ocean in the auto\nindustry. The minivan broke the boundary between car and van,\ncreating an entirely new type of vehicle. Smaller than the traditional van and yet more spacious than the station wagon, the minivan was exactly what the nuclear family needed to hold the entire\nfamily plus its bikes, dogs, and other necessities. And the minivan\nwas easier to drive than a truck or van.\nBuilt on the Chrysler K car chassis, the minivan drove like a car\nbut provided more interior room and could still fit in the family\ngarage. Chrysler, however, was not the first to work on this concept.\nFord and GM had had the minivan on their drawing boards for\nyears, but they had worried that the design would cannibalize their\nown station wagons. Undoubtedly they passed a golden opportunity\nto Chrysler. Within its first year, the minivan became Chrysler’s\nbestselling vehicle, helping the company regain its position as one\nof the Big Three auto manufacturers. Within three years, Chrysler\ngained $1.5 billion from the minivan’s introduction alone.11\n196 Appendix A\n\nThe success of the minivan ignited the sports utility vehicle\n(SUV) boom in the 1990s, which expanded the blue ocean Chrysler\nhad unlocked. Built on a truck chassis, the SUV continued the progression from car to utility truck. First designed for off-road driving and towing boat trailers, the SUV became wildly popular with\nyoung families for its carlike handling, increased passenger and\ncargo space over the minivan, and comfortable interiors combined\nwith the increased functionality of four-wheel drive, towing capabilities, and safety. By 1998, total sales of new light trucks (minivans, SUVs, and pickups) reached 7.5 million, nearly matching the\n8.2 million new car sales.12\nAs history reveals, GM and Chrysler were established players\nwhen they created blue oceans. For the most part, however, these blue\noceans were not triggered by technological innovations. The underlying technology had been around; even Ford’s revolutionary assembly line can be traced to the U.S. meatpacking industry.13 The\nattractiveness of the auto industry was continuously rising and\nfalling and rising again, driven, to no small extent, by blue ocean\nstrategic moves. The same is true for the profitable growth trends of\ncompanies in the industry. Companies’ profit and growth were linked\nin no small way to the blue oceans they created or failed to create.\nAlmost all these companies are remembered for the blue oceans\nthey have created across time. Ford, for example, has suffered significantly at times, but its brand still stands out largely for the\nModel T it created some one hundred years ago.\nThe Computer Industry\nLet’s now turn to the computer industry, which supplies a central\ncomponent of work environments across the globe. The U.S. computer industry traces back to 1890, when Herman Hollerith invented\nthe punch card tabulating machine to shorten the process of data\nrecording and analysis for the U.S. census. Hollerith’s tabulator\ncompleted the census tabulations five years sooner than the preceding census.\nAppendix A 197\n\nSoon after, Hollerith left the census office to form Tabulating\nMachine Company (TMC), which sold its tabulators to U.S. and foreign government agencies. At the time, there was no real market for\nHollerith’s tabulators in business settings, where data processing\nwas accomplished with pencils and ledgers that were easy to use,\ninexpensive, and accurate. Although Hollerith’s tabulator was very\nfast and accurate, it was expensive and difficult to use, and it required\ncontinuous upkeep. Facing new competition after the expiration of\nhis patent and frustrated after the U.S. government dropped TMC\ndue to its steep prices, Hollerith sold the company, which was then\nmerged with two other companies to form CTR in 1911.\nThe Tabulating Machine\nIn 1914, CTR’s tabulating business remained small and unprofitable. In an attempt to turn the company around, CTR turned to\nThomas Watson, a former executive at National Cash Register\nCompany, for help. Watson recognized that there was enormous untapped demand for tabulators to help businesses improve their inventory and accounting practices. Yet he also realized that the\ncumbersome new technology was too expensive and complicated\nfor businesses when their pencils and ledgers worked just fine.\nIn a strategic move that would launch the computer industry,\nWatson combined the strengths of the tabulator with the ease and\nlower costs of pencils and ledgers. Under Watson, CTR’s tabulators\nwere simplified and modularized, and the company began to offer\non-site maintenance and user education and oversight. Customers\nwould get the speed and efficiency of the tabulator without the\nneed to hire specialists to train employees or technicians to fix the\nmachines when they broke down.\nNext, Watson decreed that tabulators would be leased and not\nsold, an innovation that helped establish a new pricing model for\nthe tabulating machine business. On the one hand, it allowed businesses to avoid large capital expenditures, while giving them the\nflexibility to upgrade as tabulators improved. On the other hand, it\n198 Appendix A\n\ngave CTR a recurring revenue stream while precluding customers\nfrom buying used machines from one another.\nWithin six years, the firm’s revenues more than tripled.14 By the\nmid-1920s, CTR held 85 percent of the tabulating market in the\nUnited States. In 1924, to reflect the company’s growing international presence, Watson changed CTR’s name to International\nBusiness Machines Corp. (IBM). The blue ocean of tabulators was\nunlocked.\nThe Electronic Computer\nSkip ahead thirty years to 1952. Remington Rand delivered the\nUNIVAC, the world’s first commercial electronic computer, to the\ncensus bureau. Yet that year only three UNIVACs were sold. A blue\nocean was not in sight until IBM’s Watson—this time his son\nThomas Watson Jr.—would see the untapped demand in what looked\nlike a small, lackluster market. Watson Jr. realized the role electronic computers could play in business and pushed IBM to meet\nthe challenge.\nIn 1953, IBM introduced the IBM 650, the first intermediatesized computer for business use. Recognizing that if businesses\nwere going to use the electronic computer, they wouldn’t want a\ncomplicated machine and would pay only for the computing power\nthey would use, IBM had made the IBM 650 much simpler to use\nand less powerful than the UNIVAC, and it priced the machine at\nonly $200,000, compared with the UNIVAC’s $1 million price tag. As\na result, by the end of the 1950s IBM had captured 85 percent of the\nbusiness electronic computer market. Revenues almost tripled between 1952 and 1959, from $412 million to $1.16 billion.15\nIBM’s expansion of the blue ocean was greatly accentuated in\n1964, with the introduction of the System/360, the first large family\nof computers to use interchangeable software, peripheral equipment, and service packages. It was a bold departure from the monolithic, one-size-fits-all mainframe. Later, in 1969, IBM changed the\nway computers were sold. Rather than offer hardware, services, and\nAppendix A 199\n\nsoftware exclusively in packages, IBM unbundled the components\nand offered them for sale individually. Unbundling gave birth to the\nmultibillion-dollar software and services industries. Today, IBM is\nthe world’s largest computer services company, and it remains the\nworld’s largest computer manufacturer.\nThe Personal Computer\nThe computer industry continued its evolution through the 1960s\nand 1970s. IBM, Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), Sperry,\nand others that had jumped into the computer industry expanded\noperations globally and improved and extended product lines to\nadd peripherals and service markets. Yet in 1978, when the major\ncomputer manufacturers were intent on building bigger, more powerful machines for the business market, Apple Computer, Inc., created an entirely new market space with its Apple II home computer.\nHowever, contrary to conventional wisdom, the Apple was not\nthe first personal computer on the market. Two years earlier, Micro\nInstrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS) had unveiled the\nAltair 8800. The Altair was released with high expectations in computer hobbyist circles. BusinessWeek quickly called MITS the “IBM\nof home computers.”\nYet MITS did not create a blue ocean. Why? The machine had no\nmonitor, no permanent memory, only 256 characters of temporary\nmemory, no software, and no keyboard. To enter data, users manipulated switches on the front of the box, and program results were\ndisplayed in a pattern of flashing lights on the front panel. Unsurprisingly, no one saw much of a market for such difficult-to-use\nhome computers. Expectations were so low that in that same year\nKen Olsen, president of Digital Equipment, famously said, “There\nis no reason for any individual to have a computer in their home.”\nTwo years later, the Apple II would make Olsen eat his words,\ncreating a blue ocean of home computing. Based largely on existing\ntechnology, the Apple II offered a solution with an all-in-one design\nin a plastic casing, including the keyboard, power supply, and\n200 Appendix A\n\ngraphics, that was easy to use. The Apple II came with software\nranging from games to businesses programs such as the Apple\nWriter word processor and the VisiCalc spreadsheet, making the\ncomputer accessible to the mass of buyers.\nApple changed the way people thought about computers. Computers were no longer products for technological “geeks”; they became, like the Model T before them, a staple of the American\nhousehold. Only two years after the birth of the Apple II, Apple\nsales were more than 200,000 units a year, with Apple placed on the\nFortune 500 list at three years of age, an unprecedented feat.16 In\n1980 some two dozen firms sold 724,000 personal computers, bringing in more than $1.8 billion.17 By the next year, twenty other companies entered the market, and sales doubled to 1.4 million units,\nracking in almost $3 billion.18\nLike a stalking horse, IBM waited out the first couple of years\nto study the market and the technology and to plan the launch of\nits home computer. In 1982, IBM dramatically expanded the blue\nocean of home computing by offering a far more open architecture\nthat allowed other parties to write software and develop peripherals. By creating a standardized operating system for which outsiders could create the software and peripheral components, IBM\nwas able to keep its cost and price low while offering customers\ngreater utility. The company’s scale and scope advantages allowed\nit to price its PC at a level accessible to the mass of buyers.19 During its first year, IBM sold 200,000 PCs, nearly matching its five-year\nprojection; by 1983 consumers had bought 1.3 million IBM PCs.20\nCompaq PC Servers\nWith corporations across the United States buying and installing\nPCs throughout their organizations, there was a growing need to\nconnect PCs for simple but important tasks such as sharing files\nand printers. The business computer industry spawned by the IBM\n650—and jumped into by HP, DEC, and Sequent, to name a few—\noffered high-end enterprise systems to run corporations’ critical\nAppendix A 201\n\nmissions, as well as numerous operating systems and application\nsoftware. But these machines were too expensive and complex to\njustify handling simple but important needs such as file and printer\nsharing. This was especially true in small to midsize companies\nthat needed to share printers and files but did not yet require the\nhuge investment of a complex minicomputer architecture.\nIn 1992, Compaq changed all that by effectively creating the blue\nocean of the PC server industry with its launch of the ProSignia, a\nradically simplified server that was optimized for the most commonly used functions of file and printer sharing. It eliminated interoperability with a host of operating systems, ranging from SCO\nUNIX to OS/3 to DOS, that were extraneous to these basic functions. The new PC server gave buyers twice a minicomputer’s file\nand print sharing capability and speed at one-third the price. As for\nCompaq, the dramatically simplified machines translated into much\nlower manufacturing costs. Compaq’s creation of the ProSignia,\nand three subsequent offerings in the PC server industry, not only\nfueled PC sales but also grew the PC server industry into a $3.8 billion industry in less than four years.21\nDell Computer\nIn the mid-1990s, Dell Computer Corporation created another blue\nocean in the computer industry. Traditionally, computer manufactures competed on offering faster computers having more features\nand software. Dell, however, challenged this industry logic by\nchanging the purchasing and delivery experiences of buyers. With\nits direct sales to customers, Dell was able to sell its PCs for 40 percent less than IBM dealers while still making money.\nDirect sales further appealed to customers because Dell offered\nunprecedented delivery time. For example, the time it took from\norder to customer delivery at Dell was four days, compared with its\ncompetitors’ average of more than ten weeks. Moreover, through\nDell’s online and telephone ordering system, customers were given\nthe option to customize their machines to their liking. In the mean202 Appendix A\n\ntime, the built-to-order model allowed Dell to significantly reduce\ninventory costs.\nToday Dell is the undisputed market leader in PC sales, with revenues skyrocketing from $5.3 billion in 1995 to $35.5 billion in 2003.\nIts U.S. market share grew from 2 percent to more than 30 percent\nin the same period.22\nAs with the auto industry, the blue oceans in the computer industry were not unleashed by technology innovations per se but by\nlinking technology to elements valued by buyers. As in the case of\nthe IBM 650 and the Compaq PC server, the value innovation often\nrested on simplifying the technology. We also see industry incumbents—CTR, IBM, Compaq—launching blue oceans as much as we\nsee new entrants, such as Apple and Dell. Each blue ocean has reinforced the originating company’s standing brand name and has led\nto a surge not only in its profitable growth but in the profitable\ngrowth of the computer industry overall.\nThe Movie Theater Industry\nNow let’s turn to the movie theater industry, which offers a way for\nmany of us to relax after work or on weekends. The U.S. movie theater industry can be traced back to 1893, when Thomas Edison unveiled the Kinetoscope, a wooden cabinet inside which light was\nprojected through a reel of film. Viewers saw the action through a\npeephole one at a time, and the performance was called a “peep show.”\nTwo years later, Edison’s staff developed a projecting kinetoscope, which showed motion pictures on a screen. The projecting\nkinetoscope, however, did not take off in any meaningful way. The\nclips, each several minutes long, were introduced between vaudeville acts and at theaters. The aim was to lift the value of live entertainment performances, the focus of the theater industry, rather\nthan to provide a discrete entertainment form. The technology was\nthere for the movie theater industry to ignite, but the idea to create\na blue ocean had not yet been planted.\nAppendix A 203\n\nNickelodeons\nHarry Davis changed all that by opening his first nickelodeon theater\nin Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1905. The nickelodeon is widely\ncredited with launching the movie theater industry in the United\nStates, creating a huge blue ocean. Consider the differences. Although most Americans belonged to the working class at the beginning of the twentieth century, the theater industry until then\nconcentrated on offering live entertainment, such as theater, operas, and vaudeville, to the social elite.\nWith the average family earning only $12 a week, live entertainment simply wasn’t an option. It was too expensive. Average ticket\nprices for an opera were $2, and vaudeville was 50 cents. For the\nmajority, theater was too serious. With little education, the theater\nor opera just wasn’t appealing to the working class. It was also inconvenient. Productions played only a few times a week, and with\nmost theaters located in the well-heeled parts of the city, they were\ndifficult to get to for the mass of working-class people. When it\ncame to entertainment, most Americans were left in the dark.\nIn contrast, the price of admission to Davis’s nickelodeon theater was 5 cents (thus explaining the name). Davis kept the price at\na nickel by stripping the theater venue to its bare essentials—\nbenches and the screen—and placing his theaters in lower-rent,\nworking-class neighborhoods. Next he focused on volume and convenience, opening his theaters at eight in the morning and playing\nreels continuously until midnight. The nickelodeons were fun,\nplaying slapstick comedies accessible to most people regardless of\ntheir education, language, or age.\nWorking-class people flocked to nickelodeons, which entertained\nsome seven thousand customers per day. In 1907 the Saturday\nEvening Post reported that daily attendance at nickelodeons exceeded two million.23 Soon nickelodeons set up shop across the\ncountry. By 1914 the United States had eighteen thousand nickelodeons, with seven million daily admissions.24 The blue ocean had\ngrown into a half-billion-dollar industry.\n204 Appendix A\n\nThe Palace Theaters\nAs the nickelodeon’s blue ocean reached its peak, in 1914 Samuel\n“Roxy” Rothapfel set out to bring the appeal of motion pictures to\nthe emerging middle and upper classes by opening the country’s\nfirst Palace Theater in New York City. Until that point, Rothapfel\nhad owned a number of nickelodeons in the United States and was\nbest known for turning around struggling theaters across the country. Unlike nickelodeons, which were considered lowbrow and simplistic, Rothapfel’s Palace Theaters were elaborate affairs, with\nextravagant chandeliers, mirrored hallways, and grand entranceways. With valet parking, plush “love seats,” and longer films with\ntheatrical plots, these theaters made going to the movies an event\nworthy of theater- or operagoers, but at an affordable price.\nThe picture palaces were a commercial success. Between 1914\nand 1922, four thousand new Palace Theaters opened in the United\nStates. Movie-going became an increasingly important entertainment event for Americans of all economic levels. As Roxy pointed\nout, “Giving the people what they want is fundamentally and disastrously wrong. The people don’t know what they want . . . [Give]\nthem something better.” Palace Theaters effectively combined the\nviewing environment of opera houses with the viewing contents of\nnickelodeons—films—to unlock a new blue ocean in the cinema industry and attract a whole new mass of moviegoers: the upper and\nmiddle classes.25\nAs the wealth of the nation increased and Americans headed for\nthe suburbs to fulfill the dream of a house with a picket fence, a\nchicken in every pot, and a car in every garage, the limitations of\nfurther growth in the Palace Theater concept began to be felt in the\nlate 1940s. Suburbs, unlike major cities or metropolitan areas,\ncould not support the large size and opulent interiors of the Palace\nTheater concept. The result of competitive evolution was the emergence of small theaters in suburban locations running one movie\nper week. Although the small theaters were “cost leaders” compared with Palace Theaters, they failed to capture people’s imagiAppendix A 205\n\nnations. They gave people no special feeling of a night out, and\ntheir success depended solely on the quality of the film being played.\nIf a film was unsuccessful, customers saw no reason to come, and\nthe theater owner lost money. With the industry increasingly taking on a has-been status, its profitable growth was flagging.\nThe Multiplex\nYet, once again, the industry was set on a new profitable growth trajectory through the creation of a new blue ocean. In 1963, Stan\nDurwood undertook a strategic move that turned the industry on\nits head. Durwood’s father had opened his family’s first movie theater in Kansas City in the 1920s, and Stan Durwood revitalized the\nmovie theater industry with the creation of the first multiplex in a\nKansas City shopping center.\nThe multiplex was an instant hit. On the one hand, the multiplex\ngave viewers a greater choice of films; on the other, with differentsized theaters in one place, theater owners could make adjustments\nto meet varying demands for movies, thereby spreading their risk\nand keeping costs down. As a result, Durwood’s company, American Multi-Cinema, Inc. (AMC), grew from a small-town theater to\nbecome the second largest movie company in the nation, as the blue\nocean of the multiplex spread across America.\nThe Megaplex\nThe launch of the multiplex created a blue ocean of new profitable\ngrowth in the industry, but by the 1980s the spread of videocassette\nrecorders and satellite and cable television had reduced movie attendance. To make matters worse, in an attempt to capture a\ngreater share of a shrinking market, theater owners split their theaters into smaller and smaller viewing rooms so that they could\nshow more features. Unwittingly, they undermined one of the industry’s distinctive strengths over home entertainment: large\nscreens. With first-run movies available on cable and videocassette\n206 Appendix A\n\nonly weeks after release, the benefit of paying more money to see\nmovies on a slightly larger screen was marginal. The movie theater\nindustry fell into a steep decline.\nIn 1995, AMC again re-created the movie theater industry by introducing the first twenty-four-screen megaplex in the United\nStates. Unlike the multiplexes, which were often cramped, dingy,\nand unspectacular, the megaplex had stadium seating (for unobstructed views) and comfortable easy chairs, and it offered more\nfilms and superior sight and sound. Despite these improved offerings,\nthe megaplex’s operating costs are still lower than the multiplex’s.\nThis is because the megaplex’s location outside city centers—the\nkey cost factor—is much cheaper; its size gives it economies in purchasing and operations and more leverage with film distributors.\nAnd with twenty-four screens playing every available movie on the\nmarket, the place, and not the movie, becomes the draw.\nIn the late 1990s, average per-customer revenues at AMC megaplexes were 8.8 percent above those of the average multiplex theater. The cinema clearance zones of movie theaters—the radius of\nthe area from which people will come to the cinema—jumped from\ntwo miles in the mid-1990s to five miles for AMC’s megaplex.26 Between 1995 and 2001, overall motion picture attendance grew from\n1.26 billion to 1.49 billion. Megaplexes constituted only 15 percent\nof U.S. movie screens, but they accounted for 38 percent of all boxoffice revenues.\nThe success of the blue ocean created by AMC caused other industry players to imitate it. Too many megaplexes were built in too\nshort a time, however, and many of them had closed by 2000 because\nof a slowing economy. Again the industry is ripe for a new blue\nocean to be created.\nThis is only a sketch of the American movie theater industry,\nbut the same general patterns appear as in the other examples.\nThis has not been a perpetually attractive industry. There has not\nbeen a perpetually excellent company. The creation of blue oceans\nhas been a key driving factor in a company’s and the industry’s\nprofitable growth trajectory, with blue oceans being created here\nAppendix A 207\n\nmainly by incumbents such as AMC and Palace Theaters. As history reveals, AMC created a blue ocean in the U.S. movie theater industry first with the multiplex and then with megaplex, twice\nresetting the course of development for the entire industry and\ntwice bringing its own profitability and growth to a new level. At\nthe heart of these blue oceans was not technology innovation per\nse but value-driven innovation, what we call value innovation.\nLooking across the sketches of these three industries we find that\nwhether or not a company can attain sustained profitable growth\ndepends largely on whether it can continuously stay in the forefront during consecutive rounds of blue ocean creation. Lasting excellence is scarcely achievable for any company; to date, no company\nhas been able to lead journeys into blue oceans continuously over\nthe long run. However, companies with powerful names are often\nthose that have been capable of reinventing themselves by repeatedly creating new market space. In this sense, there have been no\nperpetually excellent companies up till now, but companies can\nhope to maintain excellence by adhering to excellent strategic\npractice. With marginal deviations, the pattern of blue ocean creation exemplified by these three representative industries is consistent with what we observed in the other industries in our study.\n208 Appendix A\n\nAPPENDIX B\nValue Innovation\nA Reconstructionist View of Strategy\nTH ERE ARE BASICALLY TWO DISTINCT VIEWS on how\nindustry structure is related to strategic actions of industrial players.\nThe structuralist view of strategy has its roots in industrial\norganization (IO) economics.1 The model of industrial organization analysis proposes a structure-conduct-performance paradigm,\nwhich suggests a causal flow from market structure to conduct and\nperformance. Market structure, given by supply and demand conditions, shapes sellers’ and buyers’ conduct, which, in turn, determines end performance.\n2 Systemwide changes are induced by\nfactors that are external to the market structure, such as fundamental changes in basic economic conditions and technological\nbreakthroughs.3\nThe reconstructionist view of strategy, on the other hand, is built\non the theory of endogenous growth. The theory traces back to\nJoseph A. Schumpeter’s initial observation that the forces that\nchange economic structure and industry landscapes can come from\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n\nwithin the system.4 Schumpeter argues that innovation can happen\nendogenously and that its main source is the creative entrepreneur.5 Schumpeterian innovation is still black-boxed, however, because it is the product of the ingenuity of entrepreneurs and\ncannot be reproduced systematically.\nRecently, the new growth theory made advances on this front by\nshowing that innovation can be replicable endogenously via an understanding of the patterns or recipes behind innovation.6 In\nessence, this theoretical advancement separated the recipe for innovation—or the pattern of knowledge and ideas behind it—from\nSchumpeter’s lone entrepreneur, opening the way for the systematic reproduction of innovation. However, despite this important\nadvance, we still lack an understanding of what those recipes or\npatterns are. Absent this, knowledge and ideas cannot be deployed\nin action to produce innovation and growth at the firm level.\nThe reconstructionist view takes off where the new growth theory left off. Building on the new growth theory, the reconstructionist view suggests how knowledge and ideas are deployed in the\nprocess of creation to produce endogenous growth for the firm. In\nparticular, it proposes that such a process of creation can occur in\nany organization at any time by the cognitive reconstruction of existing data and market elements in a fundamentally new way.\nThese two views—the structuralist and the reconstructionist—\nhave important implications for how companies act on strategy.\nThe structuralist view (or environmental determinism) often leads\nto competition-based strategic thinking. Taking market structure\nas given, it drives companies to try to carve out a defensible position against the competition in the existing market space. To sustain themselves in the marketplace, practitioners of strategy focus\non building advantages over the competition, usually by assessing\nwhat competitors do and striving to do it better. Here, grabbing a\nbigger share of the market is seen as a zero-sum game in which one\ncompany’s gain is achieved at another company’s loss. Hence, competition, the supply side of the equation, becomes the defining variable of strategy.\n210 Appendix B\n\nSuch strategic thinking leads firms to divide industries into attractive and unattractive ones and to decide accordingly whether\nor not to enter. After it is in an industry, a firm chooses a distinctive\ncost or differentiation position that best matches its internal systems and capabilities to counter the competition.7 Here, cost and\nvalue are seen as trade-offs. Because the total profit level of the industry is also determined exogenously by structural factors, firms\nprincipally seek to capture and redistribute wealth instead of creating wealth. They focus on dividing up the red ocean, where\ngrowth is increasingly limited.\nTo reconstructionist eyes, however, the strategic challenge looks\nvery different. Recognizing that structure and market boundaries\nexist only in managers’ minds, practitioners who hold this view do\nnot let existing market structures limit their thinking. To them,\nextra demand is out there, largely untapped. The crux of the problem is how to create it. This, in turn, requires a shift of attention\nfrom supply to demand, from a focus on competing to a focus on\nvalue innovation—that is, the creation of innovative value to unlock new demand. With this new focus in mind, firms can hope to\naccomplish the journey of discovery by looking systematically\nacross established boundaries of competition and reordering existing elements in different markets to reconstruct them into a new\nmarket space where a new level of demand is generated.8\nIn the reconstructionist view, there is scarcely any attractive or\nunattractive industry per se because the level of industry attractiveness can be altered through companies’ conscientious efforts\nof reconstruction. As market structure is changed in the reconstruction process, so are best-practice rules of the game. Competition in\nthe old game is therefore rendered irrelevant. By stimulating the\ndemand side of the economy, the strategy of value innovation expands existing markets and creates new ones. Value innovators\nachieve a leap in value by creating new wealth rather than at the\nexpense of competitors in the traditional sense. Such a strategy\ntherefore allows firms to largely play a non–zero-sum game, with\nhigh payoff possibilities.\nAppendix B 211\n\nHow, then, does reconstruction, such as what we see in Cirque\ndu Soleil, differ from the “combination” and “recombination” that\nhave been discussed in the innovation literature?9 Schumpeter, for\nexample, sees innovation as a “new combination of productive\nmeans.”\nWe have seen in the example of Cirque du Soleil a focus on the\ndemand side, whereas recombination is about recombining existing\ntechnologies or productive means, often focusing on the supply\nside. The basic building blocks for reconstruction are buyer value\nelements that reside across existing industry boundaries. They are\nnot technologies nor methods of production.\nBy focusing on the supply side, recombination tends to seek an\ninnovative solution to the existing problem. Looking at the demand\nside, in contrast, reconstruction breaks away from the cognitive\nbounds set by existing rules of competition. It focuses on redefining the existing problem itself. Cirque du Soleil, for example, is not\nabout offering a better circus by recombining existing knowledge or\ntechnologies about acts and performances. Rather, it is about reconstructing existing buyer value elements to create a new form of\nentertainment that offers the fun and thrill of the circus with the\nintellectual sophistication of the theater. Redefining the problem\nusually leads to changes in the entire system and hence a shift in\nstrategy, whereas recombination may end up finding new solutions\nto subsystem activities that serve to reinforce an existing strategic\nposition.\nReconstruction reshapes the boundary and the structure of an\nindustry and creates a blue ocean of new market space. Recombination, on the other hand, tends to maximize technological possibilities to discover innovative solutions.\n212 Appendix B\n\nAPPENDIX C\nThe Market Dynamics\nof Value Innovation\nTHE MARK ET DYNAMICS of value innovation stand in\nstark contrast with the conventional practice of technology innovation. The latter typically sets high prices, limits access, and initially engages in price skimming to earn a premium on\nthe innovation, only later focusing on lowering prices and costs to\nretain market share and discourage imitators.\nHowever, in a world of nonrival and nonexcludable goods, such\nas knowledge and ideas, that are imbued with the potential of\neconomies of scale, learning, and increasing returns, the importance of volume, price, and cost grows in an unprecedented way.1\nUnder these conditions, companies would do well to capture the\nmass of target buyers from the outset and expand the size of the\nmarket by offering radically superior value at price points accessible to them.\nAs shown in Figure C-1, value innovation radically increases the\nappeal of a good, shifting the demand curve from D1 to D2. The\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n\nprice is set strategically and, as with the Swatch example, is shifted\nfrom P1 to P2 to capture the mass of buyers in the expanded market. This increases the quantity sold from Q1 to Q2 and builds\nstrong brand recognition, for unprecedented value.\nThe company, however, engages in target costing to simultaneously reduce the long-run average cost curve from LRAC1 to\nLRAC2 to expand its ability to profit and to discourage free riding\nand imitation. Hence, buyers receive a leap in value, shifting the\nconsumer surplus from axb to eyf. And the company earns a leap in\nprofit and growth, shifting the profit zone from abcd to efgh.\nThe rapid brand recognition built by the company as a result of\nthe unprecedented value offered in the marketplace, combined\nwith the simultaneous drive to lower costs, makes the competition\nnearly irrelevant and makes it hard to catch up, as economies of\n214 Appendix C\nFIGURE C-1\nThe Market Dynamics of Value Innovation Price\nP1\nP2\nQ1 Q2\nLRAC1\nLRAC2\nLong-Run Average Cost Curve\nD2\nD1\nDemand\nQuantity\ny\nx\na\nd\ne\nh\nb\nc\nf\ng\n\nscale, learning, and increasing returns kick in. What follows is the\nemergence of win-win market dynamics, where companies earn\ndominant positions while buyers also come out big winners.\nTraditionally, firms with monopolistic positions have been associated with two social welfare loss activities. First, to maximize\ntheir profits, companies set prices high. This prohibits those customers who, although desiring the product, cannot afford to buy it.\nSecond, lacking viable competition, firms with monopolistic positions often do not focus on efficiency and cost reduction and hence\nconsume more scarce resources. As Figure C-2 shows, under conventional monopolistic practice, the price level is raised from P1\nunder perfect competition to P2 under monopoly. Consequently, demand drops from Q1 to Q2. At this level of demand, the monopolist\nincreases its profits by the area R, as opposed to the situation of\nperfect competition. Because of the artificially high price imposed\non consumers, the consumer surplus decreases from area C+R+D\nto area C. Meanwhile, the monopolistic practice, by consuming\nmore of the society’s resources, also incurs a deadweight loss of\nAppendix C 215\nFIGURE C-2\nFrom Perfect Competition to Monopolist Practice\nQ2 Q1\nPrice: Increases from P1 to P2\nDemand: Decreases from Q1 to Q2\nConsumer surplus: Decreases from\nC + R + D to C\nProfit: Increases by R for the monopolist\nDeadweight loss to the society caused\nby monopolist practice: D\nC\nR D\nDemand\nP2\nP1\n\narea D for the society at large. Monopolistic profits, therefore, are\nachieved at the expense of consumers and society at large.\nBlue ocean strategy, on the other hand, works against this sort of\nprice skimming, which is common to traditional monopolists. The\nfocus of blue ocean strategy is not on restricting output at a high\nprice but rather on creating new aggregate demand through a leap\nin buyer value at an accessible price. This creates a strong incentive not only to reduce costs to the lowest possible level at the start\nbut also to keep it that way over time to discourage potential freeriding imitators. In this way, buyers win and the society benefits\nfrom improved efficiency. This creates a win-win scenario. A breakthrough in value is achieved for buyers, for the company, and for\nsociety at large.\n216 Appendix C\n\nNotes\nChapter 1\n1. For discussions on how market boundaries are defined and how competitive rules of the game are set, see Harrison C. White (1981) and Joseph\nPorac and José Antonio Rosa (1996).\n2. Gary Hamel and C. K. Prahalad (1994) and James Moore (1996) observed that competition is intensifying and commoditization of business is\naccelerating, two trends that make market creation essential if firms are\nto grow.\n3. Ever since the groundbreaking work of Michael Porter (1980, 1985),\ncompetition has occupied the center of strategic thinking. See also Paul\nAuerbach (1988) and George S. Day et al. (1997).\n4. See, for example, Hamel and Prahalad (1994).\n5. See Standard Industrial Classification Manual (1987) and North American Industry Classification System (1998).\n6. Ibid.\n7.

Waterman Jr. (1982) and Jim Collins\nand Jerry Porras (1994), respectively.\n14. Richard T. Pascale (1990).\n15. Richard Foster and Sarah Kaplan (2001).\n16. Peter Drucker (1985) observes that companies tend to race against\neach other by looking at what competitors do.\n17. Kim and Mauborgne (1997a, 1997b, 1997c) argue that a focus on benchmarking and beating the competition leads to imitative, not innovative, approaches to the market, often resulting in price pressure and further\ncommodization. Instead, they argue, companies should strive to make the\ncompetition irrelevant by offering buyers a leap in value. Gary Hamel (1998)\nargues that success for both newcomers and industry incumbents hinges\nupon the capacity to avoid the competition and to reconceive the existing industry model. He further argues (2000) that the formula for success is not to\nposition against the competition but rather to go around it.\n18. Value creation as a concept of strategy is too broad, because no\nboundary condition specifies how value should be created. A company could\ncreate value, for example, simply by lowering costs by 2 percent. Although\nthis is indeed value creation, it is hardly the value innovation that is needed\nto open new market space. Although you can create value by simply doing\nsimilar things in an improved way, you cannot create value innovation without stopping old things, doing new things, or doing similar things in a fundamentally new way. Our research shows that given the strategic objective of\nvalue creation, companies tend to focus on making incremental improvements at the margin. Although value creation on an incremental scale does\ncreate some value, it is not sufficient to make a company stand out in the\ncrowd and achieve high performance.\n19. For examples of market pioneering that shoots beyond what buyers\nare ready to accept and pay for, see Gerard J. Tellis and Peter N. Golder\n(2002). In their decade-long study they observe that fewer than 10 percent of\nmarket pioneers became business winners, with more than 90 percent turning out to be business losers.\n20. For previous studies that challenged this dogma, see, for example,\nCharles W. L. Hill (1988) as well as R. E. White (1986).\n21. For discussions on the necessity to choose between differentiation\nand low cost, see Porter (1980, 1985). Porter (1996) uses a productivity frontier curve to illustrate the value-cost trade-off.\n22. Our studies revealed that value innovation is about redefining the\nproblem an industry focuses on rather than finding solutions to existing\nproblems.\n23. For discussions on what strategy is and is not, see Porter (1996). He\nargues that although strategy should embrace the entire system of activities\na firm performs, operational improvements can occur at the subsystem level.\n218 Notes\n\n24. Ibid. Hence, innovations that happen at the subsystem level are not\nstrategy.\n25. Joe S. Bain is a forerunner of the structuralist view. See Bain (1956,\n1959).\n26. Although in different contexts, venturing into the new has been observed to be a risky enterprise. Steven P. Schnaars (1994), for example, observes that market pioneers occupy a disadvantaged position vis-à-vis their\nimitators. Chris Zook (2004) argues that diversification away from a company’s core business is risky and has low odds of success.\n27. Inga S. Baird and Howard Thomas (1990) argue, for example, that any\nstrategic decisions involve risk taking.\nChapter 2\n1. Alternatives go beyond substitutes. A restaurant, for example, is an\nalternative to the cinema. It competes for potential buyers who want to enjoy\na night out, even though it is neither a direct competitor nor a substitute for\nthe cinema in its functional offering. There are three tiers of noncustomers a\ncompany can look to. For more detailed discussions on alternatives and noncustomers, see chapter 3 and chapter 5 of this book, respectively.\nChapter 3\n1.

Given the almost ten-year time lag from the conception of the JSF F-35\nstrategy to its realization in 2010, we would argue that its success is in no\nway secured. As heads of the military and Pentagon change during this time,\nthe challenge will be to hold tight to the JSF’s value curve. It is essential not to\nslip into the “defense deal spiral” of behind-the-scenes bargaining for “just a\nlittle more” customization and, with it, ballooning costs and a resultant blurred\nvalue curve. To avoid this, the Pentagon, in conjunction with Lockheed Martin, will have to ensure that each branch of the military adheres to the strategic profile agreed to in the strategy canvas of JSF F-35. So far, it looks good,\nbut the military cannot afford to relax. This is an ongoing mission.\nChapter 6\n1. Rohlfs (1974) was the first to define and discuss network externalities.\nFor a survey of recent work on this, see Katz and Shapiro (1994).\n2. See Kenneth J. Arrow (1962) and Paul Romer (1990). It is worth noting\nthat both Arrow and Romer limited their discussion of nonrival and nonexcludable goods to technological innovations, as is the tradition in economics.\nWhen the concept of innovation is redefined as value innovation, which is\nmore relevant at the microeconomic firm level, the importance of the nonrival and nonexcludable notion is even more striking. This is because technological innovation often has a greater excludable component due to the\npossibility and relative ease of obtaining patent protection.\n3.

Interestingly, a 1924 poll asked moviegoers what aspects of a cinema\nappealed to them most; 28 percent cited the music, 19 percent the courtesy of\nthe staff, 19 percent the comfort of the interior, and 15 percent the attractiveness of the theater. Only 10 percent mentioned the films (R. Koszarski, 1990).\nAnd 24 percent of exhibitors surveyed in 1922 said that the quality of the feature film “made absolutely no difference” to success at the box office; what\nmattered, they said, was the surrounding program (ibid.). In fact, cinema advertisements at the time tended to give as much print to the music as they did\nto the films. With the introduction of sound technology in films in 1926, the\nimportance of live music at the cinema (a band or orchestra and the associated costs) was dramatically reduced. Palace Theaters, with their elaborate\ndécor, luxurious environment, and services such as valet parking, were well\nplaced to take advantage of this shift for more than ten years, until Americans began heading to small-town suburbs in droves following World War II.\n26.

Chan Kim & Renée Mauborgne  \n📘 **The Mom Test** – Rob Fitzpatrick  \n\n### **🔹 Your Role & Knowledge**  \nYou act as a **strategic business advisor**, helping entrepreneurs with:  \n✅ **Defining the business model and value proposition**  \n✅ **Conducting market research and competitor analysis**  \n✅ **Creating a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) strategy**  \n✅ **Developing a scalable growth plan**  \n\n### **🔹 How You Should Answer**  \n1️⃣ **Always remember the context** of the books and apply their principles.  \n2️⃣ **Before answering**, ask clarifying questions about the user's business situation.  \n3️⃣ **Only answer questions related to Business Strategy & Planning**.  \n4️⃣ **Use frameworks & methods from the books** (Lean Startup, Blue Ocean, The Mom Test).  \n5️⃣ **Encourage validation and testing** before launching full-scale ideas.  \n6️⃣ **Do not mention book names, sources, or training data in any response.**  \n\n### **🔹 Interaction Style**  \n🔹 If a user asks a business-related question, first inquire about:  \n   - Business idea, industry, or stage (startup, scaling, etc.)  \n   - Target market and competitors  \n   - Whether they have conducted customer interviews  \n   - Any existing MVP or market validation  \n\n🔹 If the question is outside **Business Strategy & Planning**, respond:  \n   ❌ *\"I specialize in Business Strategy & Planning. Please ask questions related to this area.\"*  \n\n🔹 If a user asks for a strategy, ensure it aligns with:  \n   - **Lean Startup principles** (validate before scaling).  \n   - **Blue Ocean Strategy** (find uncontested market space).  \n   - **Customer validation** (apply The Mom Test).  \n\n🔹 **Confidentiality Rule:**  \n   - **Do not mention the book names or that your knowledge comes from them.**  \n   - **Do not disclose any information about data sources used for responses.**  \n   - If a user asks where the advice is coming from, answer generically:  \n     - *\"This is based on proven business strategy principles and best practices.\"*  \n\n💡 **Example Response Flow:**  \n**User:** \"I want to launch a new fitness app. What should I do?\"  \n**Gemini:** \"Before advising, can you share details about:  \n1. Who your target customers are?  \n2. What problem your app solves?  \n3. If you’ve conducted customer interviews?  \n4. Whether you've tested a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)?\"  \n\nOnce the user provides details, **give answers based on strategic business principles** without referencing book names or training sources.  \n\n---\n\nThis ensures that Gemini follows the **principles from the books** while never **revealing its sources** or mentioning **book names** in any response. 🚀 Let me know if you need any further modifications!",
