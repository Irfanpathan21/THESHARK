He had earned an MBA in hotel management, helped Starwood Hotels\nlaunch its W brand, and managed billions of dollars in revenue as Starwood’s corporate director of\nfood and beverage. But he was done with “big.” He yearned for a smaller, more restaurant-focused\nenvironment. So he moved to Philly to help design and launch a new luxury boutique steakhouse\ncalled Barclay Prime.\nThe concept was simple. Barclay Prime was going to deliver the best steakhouse experience\nimaginable. The restaurant is located in the toniest part of downtown Philadelphia, its dimly lit entry\npaved with marble. Instead of traditional dining chairs, patrons rest on plush sofas clustered around\nsmall marble tables. They feast from an extensive raw bar, including East and West Coast oysters and\nRussian caviar. And the menu offers delicacies like truffle-whipped potatoes and line-caught halibut\nFedExed overnight directly from Alaska.\nBut Wein knew that good food and great atmosphere wouldn’t be enough. After all, the thing\nrestaurants are best at is going out of business. More than 25 percent fail within twelve months of\nopening their doors. Sixty percent are gone within the first three years.\nRestaurants fail for any number of reasons. Expenses are high—everything from the food on the\nplates to the labor that goes into preparing and serving it. And the landscape is crowded with\ncompetitors. For every new American bistro that pops up in a major city, there are two more right\naround the corner.\nLike most small businesses, restaurants also have a huge awareness problem. Just getting the word\nout that a new restaurant has opened its doors—much less that it’s worth eating at—is an uphill battle.\nAnd unlike the large hotel chains Wein had previously worked for, most restaurants don’t have the\nresources to spend on lots of advertising or marketing. They depend on people talking about them to\nbe successful.\nWein knew he needed to generate buzz. Philadelphia already boasted dozens of expensive\nsteakhouses, and Barclay Prime needed to stand out. Wein needed something to cut through the clutter\nand give people a sense of the uniqueness of the brand. But what? How could he get people talking?\n—————\nHow about a hundred-dollar cheesesteak?\nThe standard Philly cheesesteak is available for four or five bucks at hundreds of sandwich shops,\nburger joints, and pizzerias throughout Philadelphia. It’s not a difficult recipe. Chop some steak on a\ngriddle, throw it on a hoagie (hero) roll, and melt some Provolone cheese or Cheez Whiz on top. It’s\ndelicious regional fast food, but definitely not haute cuisine.\nWein thought he could get some buzz by raising the humble cheesesteak to new culinary heights—\nand attaching a newsworthy price tag. So he started with a fresh, house-made brioche roll brushed\nwith homemade mustard. He added thinly sliced Kobe beef, marbleized to perfection. Then he\nincluded caramelized onions, shaved heirloom tomatoes, and triple-cream Taleggio cheese. All this\nwas topped off with shaved hand-harvested black truffles and butter-poached Maine lobster tail. And\njust to make it even more outrageous, he served it with a chilled split of Veuve Clicquot champagne.\nThe response was incredible.\nPeople didn’t just try the sandwich, they rushed to tell others. One person suggested that groups get\nit “as a starter . . . that way you all get the absurd story-telling rights.” Another noted that the\nsandwich was “honestly indescribable. One does not throw all these fine ingredients together and get\nanything subpar. It was like eating gold.” And given the sandwich’s price, it was almost as expensive\nas eating gold, albeit far more delicious.\nWein didn’t create just another cheesesteak, he created a conversation piece.\n—————\nIt worked. The story of the hundred-dollar cheesesteak was contagious. Talk to anyone who’s been\nto Barclay Prime. Even if people didn’t order the cheesesteak, most will likely mention it. Even\npeople who’ve never been to the restaurant love to talk about it. It was so newsworthy that USA\nToday, The Wall Street Journal , and other media outlets published pieces on the sandwich. The\nDiscovery channel filmed a segment for its Best Food Ever show. David Beckham had one when he\nwas in town. David Letterman invited Barclay’s executive chef to New York to cook him one on the\nLate Show. All that buzz for what is still, at its heart, just a sandwich.\nThe buzz helped. Barclay Prime opened nearly a decade ago. Against the odds, the restaurant has\nnot only survived but flourished. It has won various food awards and is listed among the best\nsteakhouses in Philadelphia year after year. But more important, it built a following. Barclay Prime\ncaught on.\nWHY DO PRODUCTS, IDEAS, AND BEHAVIORS CATCH ON?\nThere are lots of examples of things that have caught on. Yellow Livestrong wristbands. Nonfat Greek\nyogurt. Six Sigma management strategy. Smoking bans. Low-fat diets. Then Atkins, South Beach, and\nthe low-carb craze. The same dynamic happens on a smaller scale at the local level. A certain gym\nwill be the trendy place to go. A new church or synagogue will be in vogue. Everyone will get behind\na new school referendum.\nThese are all examples of social epidemics. Instances where products, ideas, and behaviors diffuse\nthrough a population. They start with a small set of individuals or organizations and spread, often\nfrom person to person, almost like a virus. Or in the case of the hundred-dollar cheesesteak, an overthe-\ntop, wallet-busting virus.\nBut while it’s easy to find examples of social contagion, it’s much harder to actually get something\nto catch on. Even with all the money poured into marketing and advertising, few products become\npopular. Most restaurants bomb, most businesses go under, and most social movements fail to gain\ntraction.\nWhy do some products, ideas, and behaviors succeed when others fail?\n—————\nOne reason some products and ideas become popular is that they are just plain better. We tend to\nprefer websites that are easier to use, drugs that are more effective, and scientific theories that are\ntrue rather than false. So when something comes along that offers better functionality or does a better\njob, people tend to switch to it. Remember how bulky televisions or computer monitors used to be?\nThey were so heavy and cumbersome that you had to ask a couple of friends (or risk a strained back)\nto carry one up a flight of stairs. One reason flat screens took off was that they were better. Not only\ndid they offer larger screens, but they weighed less. No wonder they became popular.\nAnother reason products catch on is attractive pricing. Not surprisingly, most people prefer paying\nless rather than more. So if two very similar products are competing, the cheaper one often wins out.\nOr if a company cuts its prices in half, that tends to help sales.\nAdvertising also plays a role. Consumers need to know about something before they can buy it. So\npeople tend to think that the more they spend on advertising, the more likely something will become\npopular. Want to get people to eat more vegetables? Spending more on ads should increase the\nnumber of people who hear your message and buy broccoli.\n—————\nBut although quality, price, and advertising contribute to products and ideas being successful, they\ndon’t explain the whole story.\nTake the first names Olivia and Rosalie. Both are great names for girls. Olivia means “olive tree”\nin Latin and is associated with fruitfulness, beauty, and peace. Rosalie has Latin and French origins\nand is derived from the word for roses. Both are about the same length, end in vowels, and have\nhandy, cute nicknames. Indeed, thousands of babies are named Olivia or Rosalie each year.\nBut think for a moment about how many people you know with each name. How many people\nyou’ve met named Olivia and how many people you’ve met named Rosalie.\nI’ll bet you know at least one Olivia, but you probably don’t know a Rosalie. In fact, if you do\nknow a Rosalie, I’ll bet you know several Olivias.\nHow did I know that? Olivia is a much more popular name. In 2010, for example, there were\nalmost 17,000 Olivias born in the United States but only 492 Rosalies. In fact, while the name\nRosalie was somewhat popular in the 1920s, it never reached the stratospheric popularity that Olivia\nrecently achieved.\nWhen trying to explain why Olivia became a more popular name than Rosalie, familiar\nexplanations like quality, price, and advertising get stuck. It’s not like one name is really “better” than\nthe other, and both names are free, so there is no difference in price. There is also no advertising\ncampaign to try to get everyone to name their kids Olivia, no company determined to make that name\nthe hottest thing since Pokémon.\nThe same thing can be said for videos on YouTube. There’s no difference in price (all are free to\nwatch), and few videos receive any advertising or marketing push. And although some videos have\nhigher production values, most that go viral are blurred and out of focus, shot by an amateur on an\ninexpensive camera or cell phone.*\nSo if quality, price, and advertising don’t explain why one first name becomes more popular than\nanother, or why one You-Tube video gets more views, what does?\nSOCIAL TRANSMISSION\nSocial influence and word of mouth. People love to share stories, news, and information with those\naround them. We tell our friends about great vacation destinations, chat with our neighbors about\ngood deals, and gossip with coworkers about potential layoffs. We write online reviews about\nmovies, share rumors on Facebook, and tweet about recipes we just tried. People share more than\n16,000 words per day and every hour there are more than 100 million conversations about brands.\nBut word of mouth is not just frequent, it’s also important. The things others tell us, e-mail us, and\ntext us have a significant impact on what we think, read, buy, and do. We try websites our neighbors\nrecommend, read books our relatives praise, and vote for candidates our friends endorse. Word of\nmouth is the primary factor behind 20 percent to 50 percent of all purchasing decisions.\nConsequently, social influence has a huge impact on whether products, ideas, and behaviors catch\non. A word-of-mouth conversation by a new customer leads to an almost $200 increase in restaurant\nsales. A five-star review on Amazon.com leads to approximately twenty more books sold than a onestar\nreview. Doctors are more likely to prescribe a new drug if other doctors they know have\nprescribed it. People are more likely to quit smoking if their friends quit and get fatter if their friends\nbecome obese. In fact, while traditional advertising is still useful, word of mouth from everyday Joes\nand Janes is at least ten times more effective.\nWord of mouth is more effective than traditional advertising for two key reasons. First, it’s more\npersuasive. Advertisements usually tell us how great a product is. You’ve heard it all—how nine out\nof ten dentists recommend Crest or how no other detergent will get your clothes as clean as Tide.\nBut because ads will always argue that their products are the best, they’re not really credible. Ever\nseen a Crest ad say that only one out of ten dentists prefers Crest? Or that four of the other nine think\nCrest will rot your teeth?\nOur friends, however, tend to tell it to us straight. If they thought Crest did a good job, they’ll say\nthat. But they’d also tell us if Crest tasted bad or failed to whiten their teeth. Their objectivity,\ncoupled with their candidness, make us much more likely to trust, listen to, and believe our friends.\nSecond, word of mouth is more targeted. Companies try to advertise in ways that allow them to\nreach the largest number of interested customers. Take a company that sells skis. Television ads\nduring the nightly news probably wouldn’t be very efficient because many of the viewers don’t ski.\nSo the company might advertise in a ski magazine, or on the back of lift tickets to a popular slope. But\nwhile this would ensure that most people who see the ad like skiing, the company would still end up\nwasting money because lots of those people don’t need new skis.\nWord of mouth, on the other hand, is naturally directed toward an interested audience. We don’t\nshare a news story or recommendation with everyone we know. Rather, we tend to select particular\npeople who we think would find that given piece of information most relevant. We’re not going to tell\na friend about a new pair of skis if we know the friend hates skiing. And we’re not going to tell a\nfriend who doesn’t have kids about the best way to change a diaper. Word of mouth tends to reach\npeople who are actually interested in the thing being discussed. No wonder customers referred by\ntheir friends spend more, shop faster, and are more profitable overall.\nA particularly nice example of how word of mouth improves targeting came to me in the mail a few\nyears ago. Every so often publishers will send me free books. Usually they’re related to marketing\nand the publisher hopes that if I’m given a free copy, I’ll be more likely to assign the book to my\nstudents (and sell them a bunch of copies in the process).\nBut a few years ago, one company did something slightly different. It sent me two copies of the\nsame book.\nNow, unless I’m mistaken, there’s no reason for me to read the second copy, once I’ve read the\nfirst. But these publishers had a different goal in mind. They sent a note explaining why they thought\nthe book would be good for my students, but they also mentioned that they sent a second copy so that I\ncould pass it along to a colleague who might be interested.\nThat’s how word of mouth helps with targeting. Rather than sending books to everyone, the\npublishers got me, and others, to do the targeting for them. Just like a searchlight, each recipient of the\ndouble mailing would look through his or her personal social network, find the person that the book\nwould be most relevant for, and pass it along.\nGENERATING WORD OF MOUTH\nBut want to know the best thing about word of mouth? It’s available to everyone. From Fortune 500\ncompanies trying to increase sales to corner restaurants trying to fill tables. And from nonprofits\ntrying to fight obesity to newbie politicians trying to get elected. Word of mouth helps things catch on.\nWord of mouth even helps B2B companies get new clients from existing ones. And it doesn’t require\nmillions of dollars spent on advertising. It just requires getting people to talk.\nThe challenge, though, is how to do that.\nFrom start-ups to starlets, people have embraced social media as the wave of the future. Facebook,\nTwitter, YouTube, and other channels are seen as ways to cultivate a following and engage\nconsumers. Brands post ads, aspiring musicians post videos, and small businesses post deals.\nCompanies and organizations have fallen over themselves in their rush to jump on the buzz marketing\nbandwagon. The logic is straightforward. If they can get people to talk about their idea or share their\ncontent, it will spread through social networks like a virus, making their product or idea instantly\npopular along the way.\nBut there are two issues with this approach: the focus and the execution.\nHelp me out with a quick pop quiz. What percent of word of mouth do you think happens online? In\nother words, what percent of chatter happens over social media, blogs, e-mail, and chat rooms?\nIf you’re like most people you probably guessed something around 50 or 60 percent. Some people\nguess upward of 70 percent and some guess much lower, but after having asked this question of\nhundreds of students and executives, I find that the average is around 50 percent.\nAnd that number makes sense. After all, social media have certainly exploded as of late. Millions\nof people use these sites every day, and billions of pieces of content get shared every month. These\ntechnologies have made it faster and easier to share things quickly with a broad group of people.\nBut 50 percent is wrong.\nNot even close.\nThe actual number is 7 percent. Not 47 percent, not 27 percent, but 7 percent. Research by the\nKeller Fay Group finds that only 7 percent of word of mouth happens online.\nMost people are extremely surprised when they hear that number. “But that’s way too low,” they\nprotest. “People spend a huge amount of time online!” And that’s true. People do spend a good bit of\ntime online. Close to two hours a day by some estimates. But we forget that people also spend a lot of\ntime offline. More than eight times as much, in fact. And that creates a lot more time for offline\nconversations.\nWe also tend to overestimate online word of mouth because it’s easier to see. Social media sites\nprovide a handy record of all the clips, comments, and other content we share online. So when we\nlook at it, it seems like a lot. But we don’t think as much about all the offline conversations we had\nover that same time period because we can’t easily see them. There is no recording of the chat we\nhad with Susan after lunch or the conversation we had with Tim while waiting for the kids to be done\nwith practice. But while they may not be as easy to see, they still have an important impact on our\nbehavior.\nFurther, while one might think that online word of mouth reaches more people, that’s not always the\ncase. Sure, online conversations could reach more people. After all, while face-to-face conversations\ntend to be one-on-one, or among a small handful of people, the average tweet or Facebook status\nupdate is sent to more than one hundred people. But not all of these potential recipients will actually\nsee every message. People are inundated with online content, so they don’t have the time to read\nevery tweet, message, or update sent their way. A quick exercise among my students, for example,\nshowed that less than 10 percent of their friends responded to a message they posted. Most Twitter\nposts reach even fewer. Online conversations could reach a much larger audience, but given that\noffline conversations may be more in-depth, it’s unclear that social media is the better way to go.\nSo the first issue with all the hype around social media is that people tend to ignore the importance\nof offline word of mouth, even though offline discussions are more prevalent, and potentially even\nmore impactful, than online ones.\nThe second issue is that Facebook and Twitter are technologies, not strategies. Word-of-mouth\nmarketing is effective only if people actually talk. Public health officials can tweet daily bulletins\nabout safe sex, but if but no one passes them along, the campaign will fail. Just putting up a Facebook\npage or tweeting doesn’t mean anyone will notice or spread the word. Fifty percent of YouTube\nvideos have fewer than five hundred views. Only one-third of 1 percent get more than 1 million.\nHarnessing the power of word of mouth, online or offline, requires understanding why people talk\nand why some things get talked about and shared more than others. The psychology of sharing. The\nscience of social transmission.\nThe next time you’re chatting at a party or grabbing a bite to eat with a coworker, imagine being a\nfly on the wall, eavesdropping on your conversation. You might end up chatting about a new movie or\ngossiping about a colleague. You might trade stories about vacation, mention someone’s new baby, or\ncomplain about the unusually warm weather.\nWhy? You could have talked about anything. There are millions of different topics, ideas, products,\nand stories you could have discussed. Why did you talk about those things in particular? Why that\nspecific story, movie, or coworker rather than a different one?\nCertain stories are more contagious, and certain rumors are more infectious. Some online content\ngoes viral while other content never gets passed on. Some products get a good deal of word of mouth,\nwhile others go unmentioned. Why? What causes certain products, ideas, and behaviors to be talked\nabout more?\nThat’s what this book is about.\n—————\nOne common intuition is that generating word of mouth is all about finding the right people. That\ncertain special individuals are just more influential than others. In The Tipping Point, for example,\nMalcolm Gladwell argues that social epidemics are driven “by the efforts of a handful of exceptional\npeople” whom he calls mavens, connectors, and salesmen. Others suggest that “one in 10 Americans\ntells the other nine how to vote, where to eat, and what to buy.” Marketers spend millions of dollars\ntrying to find these so-called opinion leaders and get them to endorse their products. Political\ncampaigns look for the “influentials” to support their side.\nThe notion is that anything these special people touch will turn to gold. If they adopt or talk about a\nproduct or idea, it will become popular.\nBut conventional wisdom is wrong. Yes, we all know people who are really persuasive, and yes,\nsome people have more friends than others. But in most cases that doesn’t make them any more\ninfluential in spreading information or making things go viral.\nFurther, by focusing so much on the messenger, we’ve neglected a much more obvious driver of\nsharing: the message.\nTo use an analogy, think about jokes. We all have friends who are better joke tellers than we are.\nWhenever they tell a joke the room bursts out laughing.\nBut jokes also vary. Some jokes are so funny that it doesn’t matter who tells them. Everyone laughs\neven if the person sharing the joke isn’t all that funny. Contagious content is like that—so inherently\nviral that it spreads regardless of who is doing the talking. Regardless of whether the messengers are\nreally persuasive or not and regardless of whether they have ten friends or ten thousand.\n—————\nSo what about a message makes people want to pass it on?\nNot surprisingly, social media “gurus” and word-of-mouth practitioners have made lots of guesses.\nOne prevalent theory is that virality is completely random—that it’s impossible to predict whether a\ngiven video or piece of content will be highly shared. Other people conjecture based on case studies\nand anecdotes. Because so many of the most popular YouTube videos are either funny or cute—\ninvolving babies or kittens—you commonly hear that humor or cuteness is a key ingredient for\nvirality.\nBut these “theories” ignore the fact that many funny or cute videos never take off. Sure, some cat\nclips get millions of views, but those are the outliers, not the norm. Most get less than a few dozen.\nYou may as well observe that Bill Clinton, Bill Gates, and Bill Cosby are all famous and conclude\nthat changing your name to Bill is the route to fame and fortune. Although the initial observation is\ncorrect, the conclusion is patently ludicrous. By merely looking at a handful of viral hits, people miss\nthe fact that many of those features also exist in content that failed to attract any audience whatsoever.\nTo fully understand what causes people to share things, you have to look at both successes and\nfailures. And whether, more often than not, certain characteristics are linked to success.\nARE SOME THINGS JUST BORN WORD-OF-MOUTH WORTHY?\nNow at this point you might be saying to yourself, great, some things are more contagious than others.\nBut is it possible to make anything contagious, or are some things just naturally more infectious?\nSmartphones tend to be more exciting than tax returns, talking dogs are more interesting than tort\nreform, and Hollywood movies are cooler than toasters or blenders.\nAre makers of the former just better off than the latter? Are some products and ideas just born\ncontagious while others aren’t? Or can any product or idea be engineered to be more infectious?\n—————\nTom Dickson was looking for a new job. Born in San Francisco, he was led by his Mormon faith to\nattend school at Brigham Young University in Salt Lake City, where he graduated in 1971 with a\ndegree in engineering. He moved home after graduation, but the job market was tough and there\nweren’t many opportunities. The only position he could find was at a company making birth control\nand intrauterine devices. These devices helped prevent pregnancy, but they could also be seen as\nabortives, which went against Tom’s Mormon beliefs. A Mormon helping to develop new methods of\nbirth control? It was time to find something new.\nTom had always been interested in bread making. While practicing his hobby, he noticed that there\nwere no good cheap home grinders with which to make flour. So Tom put his engineering skills to\nwork. After playing around with a ten-dollar vacuum motor, he cobbled together something that\nmilled finer flour at a cheaper price than anything currently on the market.\nThe grinder was so good that Tom started producing it on a larger scale. The business did\nreasonably well, and playing around with different methods of processing food got him interested in\nmore general blenders. Soon he moved back to Utah to start his own blender company. In 1995 he\nproduced his first home blender, and in 1999 Blendtec was founded.\nBut although the product was great, no one really knew about it. Awareness was low. So in 2006,\nTom hired George Wright, another BYU alum, as his marketing director. Later, George would joke\nthat the marketing budget at his prior company was greater than all of Blendtec’s revenues.\nOn one of his first days on the job, George noticed a pile of sawdust on the floor of the\nmanufacturing plant. Given that no construction was in progress, George was puzzled. What was\ngoing on?\nIt turned out that Tom was in the factory doing what he did every day: trying to break blenders. To\ntest the durability and power of Blendtec blenders, Tom would cram two-by-two boards, among other\nobjects, into the blenders and turn them on—hence the sawdust.\nGeorge had an idea that would make Tom’s blender famous.\nWith a meager fifty-dollar budget (not fifty million or even fifty thousand), George went out and\nbought marbles, golf balls, and a rake. He also purchased a white lab coat for Tom, just like what a\nlaboratory scientist would wear. Then he put Tom and a blender in front of a camera. George asked\nTom to do exactly what he had done with the two-by-twos: see if they would blend.\nImagine taking a handful of marbles and tossing them into your home blender. Not the cheap kind of\nmarbles made of plastic or clay, but the real ones. The half-inch orbs made out of solid glass. So\nstrong that they could withstand a car driving over them.\nThat is exactly what Tom did. He dropped fifty glass marbles in one of his blenders and hit the\nbutton for slow churn. The marbles bounced furiously around the blender, making rat-tat-tat noises\nlike a hailstorm on the roof of a car.\nTom waited fifteen seconds and then stopped the blender. He cautiously lifted the top as white\nsmoke poured out: glass dust. All that was left of the marbles was a fine powder that looked like\nflour. Rather than cracking from the punishment, the blender had flexed its muscles. Golf balls were\npulverized, and the rake was reduced to a pile of slivers. George posted the videos on YouTube and\ncrossed his fingers.\nHis intuition was right. People were amazed. They loved the videos. They were surprised at the\nblender’s power and called it everything from “insanely awesome” to “the ultimate blender.” Some\ncouldn’t even believe that what they were seeing was possible. Others wondered what else the\nblender could pulverize. Computer hard drives? A samurai sword?\nIn the first week the videos racked up 6 million views. Tom and George had hit a viral home run.\nTom went on to blend everything from Bic lighters to Nintendo Wii controllers. He’s tried glow\nsticks, Justin Bieber CDs, and even an iPhone. Not only did Blendtec blenders demolish all these\nobjects, but their video series, titled Will It Blend?, received more than 300 million views. Within\ntwo years the campaign increased retail blender sales 700 percent. All from videos made for less\nthan a few hundred dollars apiece. And for a product that seemed anything but word-of-mouth worthy.\nA regular, boring old blender.\n—————\nThe Blendtec story demonstrates one of the key takeaways of contagious content. Virality isn’t\nborn, it’s made.\nAnd that is good news indeed.\nSome people are lucky. Their ideas or initiatives happen to be things that seem to naturally\ngenerate lots of excitement and buzz.\nBut as the Blendtec story shows, even regular everyday products and ideas can generate lots of\nword-of-mouth if someone figures out the right way to do it. Regardless of how plain or boring a\nproduct or idea may seem, there are ways to make it contagious.\nSo how can we design products, ideas, and behaviors so that people will talk about them?\nSTUDYING SOCIAL INFLUENCE\nMy path to studying social epidemics was anything but direct. My parents didn’t believe in sweets or\ntelevision for their children, and instead gave us educational rewards. One holiday season I\nremember being particularly excited to get a book of logic puzzles, which I explored incessantly over\nthe next few months. These experiences fostered an interest in math and science, and after doing a\nresearch project in high school on urban hydrology (how the composition of a stream’s watershed\naffects its shape), I went to college thinking I would become an environmental engineer.\nBut something funny happened in college. While sitting in one of my “hard” science classes, I\nstarted to wonder if I could apply the same toolkit to study complex social phenomena. I had always\nliked people-watching, and when I did happen to watch TV, I enjoyed it more for the ads than the\nprograms. But I realized that rather than just abstractly musing about why people did things, I could\napply the scientific method to find out the answers. The same research tools used in biology and\nchemistry could be used to understand social influence and interpersonal communication.\nSo I started taking psychology and sociology courses and got involved in research on how people\nperceive themselves and others. A few years in, my grandmother sent me a review of a new book she\nthought I might find interesting. It was called The Tipping Point.\nI loved the book and read everything related I could find. But I kept being frustrated by a singular\nissue. The ideas in that book were amazingly powerful, but they were mainly descriptive. Sure some\nthings catch on, but why? What was the underlying human behavior that drove these outcomes? These\nwere interesting questions that needed answers. I decided to start finding them.\n—————\nAfter completing my PhD and more than a decade of research, I’ve discovered some answers. I’ve\nspent the last ten years, most recently as a marketing professor at the Wharton School at the University\nof Pennsylvania, studying this and related questions. With an incredible array of collaborators I’ve\nexamined things like\n• Why certain New York Times articles or YouTube videos go viral\n• Why some products get more word of mouth\n• Why certain political messages spread\n• When and why certain baby names catch on or die out\n• When negative publicity increases, versus decreases, sales\nWe’ve analyzed hundreds of years of baby names, thousands of New York Times articles, and\nmillions of car purchases. We’ve spent thousands of hours collecting, coding, and analyzing\neverything from brands and YouTube videos to urban legends, product reviews, and face-to-face\nconversations. All with the goal of understanding social influence and what drives certain things to\nbecome popular.\nA few years ago, I started teaching a course at Wharton called “Contagious.” The premise was\nsimple. Whether you’re in marketing, politics, engineering, or public health, you need to understand\nhow to make your products and ideas catch on. Brand managers want their products to get more buzz.\nPoliticians want their ideas to diffuse throughout the population. Health officials want people to cook\nrather than eat fast food. Hundreds of undergraduates, MBAs, and executives have taken the class and\nlearned about how social influence drives products, ideas, and behaviors to succeed.\nEvery so often I’d get e-mails from people who couldn’t take the class. They’d heard about it from\na friend and liked the material but had a scheduling conflict or didn’t find out about it in time. So they\nasked if there was a book they could read to catch them up on what they missed.\nThere are certainly some great books out there. The Tipping Point is a fantastic read. But while it\nis filled with entertaining stories, the science has come a long way since it was released over a\ndecade ago. Made to Stick, by Chip and Dan Heath, is another favorite of mine (full disclosure: Chip\nwas my mentor in graduate school, so the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree). It weaves together\nclever stories with academic research on cognitive psychology and human memory. But although the\nHeaths’ book focuses on making ideas “stick”—getting people to remember them—it says less about\nhow to make products and ideas spread, or getting people to pass them on.\nSo whenever people asked to read something about what drives word of mouth, I would direct\nthem to the various academic papers I and others had published in the area. Inevitably, some people\nwould e-mail back to say thanks but request something more “accessible.” In other words, something\nthat was rigorous but less dry than the typical jargon-laden articles published in academic journals. A\nbook that provided them with research-based principles for understanding what makes things catch\non.\nThis is that book.\nSIX PRINCIPLES OF CONTAGIOUSNESS\nThis book explains what makes content contagious. By “content,” I mean stories, news, and\ninformation. Products and ideas, messages and videos. Everything from fund-raising at the local\npublic radio station to the safe-sex messages we’re trying to teach our kids. By “contagious,” I mean\nlikely to spread. To diffuse from person to person via word of mouth and social influence. To be\ntalked about, shared, or imitated by consumers, coworkers, and constituents.\nIn our research, my collaborators and I noticed some common themes, or attributes, across a range\nof contagious content. A recipe, if you will, for making products, ideas, and behaviors more likely to\nbecome popular.\nTake Will It Blend? and the hundred-dollar cheesesteak at Barclay Prime. Both stories evoke\nemotions like surprise or amazement: Who would have thought a blender could tear through an\niPhone, or that a cheesesteak would cost anywhere near a hundred dollars? Both stories are also\npretty remarkable, so they make the teller look cool for passing them on. And both offer useful\ninformation: it’s always helpful to know about products that work well or restaurants that have great\nfood.\nJust as recipes often call for sugar to make something sweet, we kept finding the same ingredients\nin ads that went viral, news articles that were shared, or products that received lots of word of mouth.\nAfter analyzing hundreds of contagious messages, products, and ideas, we noticed that the same six\n“ingredients,” or principles, were often at work. Six key STEPPS, as I call them, that cause things to\nbe talked about, shared, and imitated.\nPrinciple 1: Social Currency\nHow does it make people look to talk about a product or idea? Most people would rather look smart\nthan dumb, rich than poor, and cool than geeky. Just like the clothes we wear and the cars we drive,\nwhat we talk about influences how others see us. It’s social currency. Knowing about cool things—\nlike a blender that can tear through an iPhone—makes people seem sharp and in the know. So to get\npeople talking we need to craft messages that help them achieve these desired impressions. We need\nto find our inner remarkability and make people feel like insiders. We need to leverage game\nmechanics to give people ways to achieve and provide visible symbols of status that they can show to\nothers.\nPrinciple 2: Triggers\nHow do we remind people to talk about our products and ideas? Triggers are stimuli that prompt\npeople to think about related things. Peanut butter reminds us of jelly and the word “dog” reminds us\nof the word “cat.” If you live in Philadelphia, seeing a cheesesteak might remind you of the hundreddollar\none at Barclay Prime. People often talk about whatever comes to mind, so the more often\npeople think about a product or idea, the more it will be talked about. We need to design products and\nideas that are frequently triggered by the environment and create new triggers by linking our products\nand ideas to prevalent cues in that environment. Top of mind leads to tip of tongue.\nPrinciple 3: Emotion\nWhen we care, we share. So how can we craft messages and ideas that make people feel something?\nNaturally contagious content usually evokes some sort of emotion. Blending an iPhone is surprising.\nA potential tax hike is infuriating. Emotional things often get shared. So rather than harping on\nfunction, we need to focus on feelings. But as we’ll discuss, some emotions increase sharing, while\nothers actually decrease it. So we need to pick the right emotions to evoke. We need to kindle the fire.\nSometimes even negative emotions may be useful.\nPrinciple 4: Public\nCan people see when others are using our product or engaging in our desired behavior? The famous\nphrase “Monkey see, monkey do” captures more than just the human tendency to imitate. It also tells\nus that it’s hard to copy something you can’t see. Making things more observable makes them easier to\nimitate, which makes them more likely to become popular. So we need to make our products and\nideas more public. We need to design products and initiatives that advertise themselves and create\nbehavioral residue that sticks around even after people have bought the product or espoused the idea.\nPrinciple 5: Practical Value\nHow can we craft content that seems useful? People like to help others, so if we can show them how\nour products or ideas will save time, improve health, or save money, they’ll spread the word. But\ngiven how inundated people are with information, we need to make our message stand out. We need\nto understand what makes something seem like a particularly good deal. We need to highlight the\nincredible value of what we offer—monetarily and otherwise. And we need to package our\nknowledge and expertise so that people can easily pass it on.\nPrinciple 6: Stories\nWhat broader narrative can we wrap our idea in? People don’t just share information, they tell\nstories. But just like the epic tale of the Trojan Horse, stories are vessels that carry things such as\nmorals and lessons. Information travels under the guise of what seems like idle chatter. So we need to\nbuild our own Trojan horses, embedding our products and ideas in stories that people want to tell.\nBut we need to do more than just tell a great story. We need to make virality valuable. We need to\nmake our message so integral to the narrative that people can’t tell the story without it.\n—————\nThese are the six principles of contagiousness: products or ideas that contain Social Currency and\nare Triggered, Emotional, Public, Practically Valuable , and wrapped into Stories. Each chapter\nfocuses on one of these principles. These chapters bring together research and examples to show the\nscience behind each principle and how individuals, companies, and organizations have applied the\nprinciples to help their products, ideas, and behaviors catch on.\nThese principles can be compacted into an acronym. Taken together they spell STEPPS. Think of\nthe principles as the six STEPPS to crafting contagious content. These ingredients lead ideas to get\ntalked about and succeed. People talked about the hundred-dollar cheesesteak at Barclay Prime\nbecause it gave them Social Currency, was Triggered (high frequency of cheesesteaks in\nPhiladelphia), Emotional (very surprising), Practically Valuable (useful information about highquality\nsteakhouse), and wrapped in a Story. Enhancing these components in messages, products, or\nideas will make them more likely to spread and become popular. I hope that ordering the principles\nthis way will make them easier to remember and use.**\nThe book is designed with two (overlapping) audiences in mind. You may have always wondered\nwhy people gossip, why online content goes viral, why rumors spread, or why everyone always\nseems to talk about certain topics around the water cooler. Talking and sharing are some of our most\nfundamental behaviors. These actions connect us, shape us, and make us human. This book sheds light\non the underlying psychological and sociological processes behind the science of social transmission.\nThis book is also designed for people who want their products, ideas, and behaviors to spread.\nAcross industries, companies big and small want their products to become popular. The\nneighborhood coffee shop wants more customers, lawyers want more clients, movie theaters want\nmore patrons, and bloggers want more views and shares. Nonprofits, policy makers, scientists,\npoliticians, and many other constituencies also have “products” or ideas that they want to catch on.\nMuseums want more visitors, dog shelters want more adoptions, and conservationists want more\npeople to rally against deforestation.\nWhether you’re a manager at a big company, a small business owner trying to boost awareness, a\npolitician running for office, or a health official trying to get the word out, this book will help you\nunderstand how to make your products and ideas more contagious. It provides a framework and a set\nof specific, actionable techniques for helping information spread—for engineering stories, messages,\nadvertisements, and information so that people will share them. Regardless of whether those people\nhave ten friends or ten thousand. And regardless of whether they are talkative and persuasive or quiet\nand shy.\nThis book provides cutting-edge science about how word of mouth and social transmission work.\nAnd how you can leverage them to make your products and ideas succeed.\n* When I use the word “viral” in this book, I mean something that is more likely to spread from one person to another. The analogy to\ndiseases is a good one, but only up to a point. Diseases also spread from person to person, but one key difference is the expected length\nof the transmission chain. One person can easily be the initiator of a disease that spreads to a few people, and then from them to a few\nmore people, and so on, until a large number of people have been infected, solely due to that initial individual. Such long chains, however,\nmay be less common with products and ideas (Goel, Watts, and Goldstein 2012). People often share products and ideas with others, but\nthe likelihood that one person generates an extremely long chain may be small. So when I say that doing X will make an idea more viral,\nfor example, I mean that it will be more likely to spread from one person to another, regardless of whether it eventually generates a long\nchain or “infects” an entire population.\n** Note, however, that the recipe analogy breaks down in one respect. The principles are unlike a recipe because not all six ingredients\nare required to make a product or idea contagious. Sure, the more the better, but it’s not as though a product that is Public will fail\nbecause it’s not wrapped in a Story. So think of these principles less like a recipe and more like tasty salad toppings. Cobb salads, for\nexample, often come with chicken, tomato, bacon, egg, avocado, and cheese. But a salad with just cheese and bacon is still delicious. The\nprinciples are relatively independent, so you can pick and choose whichever ones you want to apply.\nSome of the principles are easier to apply to certain types of ideas or initiatives. Nonprofits usually have a good sense of how to\nevoke Emotion, and it’s often easier to play up Public visibility for products or behaviors that have a physical component. That said,\ncontagious content often comes from applying principles that originally might have seemed unlikely. Heavy-duty blenders already have\nPractical Value, but Will It Blend? went viral because it found a way to give a blender Social Currency. The video showed how a\nseemingly regular product was actually quite remarkable.\n1. Social Currency\nAmong the brownstones and vintage shops on St. Mark’s Place near Tompkins Square Park in New\nYork City, you’ll notice a small eatery. It’s marked by a large red hot-dog-shaped sign with the words\n“eat me” written in what looks like mustard. Walk down a small flight of stairs and you’re in a\ngenuine old hole-in-the-wall hot dog restaurant. The long tables are set with all your favorite\ncondiments, you can play any number of arcade-style video games, and, of course, order off a menu to\ndie for.\nSeventeen varieties of hot dogs are offered. Every type of frankfurter you could imagine. The Good\nMorning is a bacon-wrapped hot dog smothered with melted cheese and topped with a fried egg. The\nTsunami has teriyaki, pineapple, and green onions. And purists can order the New Yorker, a classic\ngrilled all-beef frankfurter.\nBut look beyond the gingham tablecloths and hipsters enjoying their dogs. Notice that vintage\nwooden phone booth tucked into the corner? The one that looks like something Clark Kent might have\ndashed into to change into Superman? Go ahead, peek inside.\nYou’ll notice an old-school rotary dial phone hanging on the inside of the booth, the type that has a\nfinger wheel with little holes for you to dial each number. Just for kicks, place your finger in the hole\nunder the number 2 (ABC). Dial clockwise until you reach the finger stop, release the wheel, and\nhold the receiver to your ear.\nTo your astonishment, someone answers. “Do you have a reservation?” a voice asks. A\nreservation?\nYes, a reservation. Of course you don’t have one. What would you even need a reservation for? A\nphone booth in the corner of a hot dog restaurant?\nBut today is your lucky day, apparently: they can take you. Suddenly, the back of the booth swings\nopen—it’s a secret door!—and you are let into a clandestine bar called, of all things, Please Don’t\nTell.\n—————\nIn 1999, Brian Shebairo and his childhood friend Chris Antista decided to get into the hot dog\nbusiness. The pair had grown up in New Jersey eating at famous places like Rutt’s Hut and Johnny &\nHanges and wanted to bring that same hot dog experience to New York City. After two years of R &\nD, riding their motorcycles up and down the East Coast tasting the best hot dogs, Brian and Chris\nwere ready. On October 6, 2001, they opened Crif Dogs in the East Village. The name coming from\nthe sound that poured out of Brian’s mouth one day when he tried to say Chris’s name while still\nmunching on a hot dog.\nCrif Dogs was a big hit and won the best hot dog award from a variety of publications. But as the\nyears passed, Brian was looking for a new challenge. He wanted to open a bar. Crif Dogs had always\nhad a liquor license but had never taken full advantage of it. He and Chris had experimented with a\nfrozen margarita machine, and kept a bottle of Jägermeister in the freezer every once in a while, but to\ndo it right they really needed more space. Next door was a struggling bubble tea lounge. Brian’s\nlawyer said that if they could get the space, the liquor license would transfer. After three years of\nconsistent prodding, the neighbor finally gave in.\nBut now came the tough part. New York City is flush with bars. In a four-block radius around Crif\nDogs there are more than sixty places to grab a drink. A handful are even on the same block.\nOriginally, Brian had a grungy rock-and-roll bar in mind. But that wouldn’t cut it. The concept needed\nbe something more remarkable. Something that would get people talking and draw them in.\nOne day Brian ran into a friend who had an antique business. A big outdoor flea market selling\neverything from art deco dressers to glass eyes and stuffed cheetahs. The guy said he had found a neat\nold 1930s phone booth that he thought would work well in Brian’s bar.\nBrian had an idea.\nWhen Brian was a kid, his uncle worked as a carpenter. In addition to helping to build houses and\nthe usual things that carpenters do, the uncle built a room in the basement that had secret doors. The\ndoors weren’t even that concealed, just wood that meshed into other wood, but if you pushed in the\nright place, you could get access to a hidden storage space. No secret lair or loot concealed inside,\nbut cool nonetheless.\nBrian decided to turn the phone booth into the door to a secret bar.\n—————\nEverything about Please Don’t Tell suggests that you’ve been let into a very special secret. You\nwon’t find a sign posted on the street. You won’t find it advertised on billboards or in magazines.\nAnd the only entrance is through a semihidden phone booth inside a hot dog diner.\nOf course, this makes no sense. Don’t marketers preach that blatant advertising and easy access are\nthe cornerstones of a successful business?\nPlease Don’t Tell has never advertised. Yet since opening in 2007 it has been one of the most\nsought-after drink reservations in New York City. It takes bookings only the day of, and the\nreservation line opens at 3:00 p.m., sharp. Spots are first-come, first-served. Callers madly hit redial\nagain and again in the hopes of cutting through the busy signals. By 3:30 all spots are booked.\nPlease Don’t Tell doesn’t push market. It doesn’t try to hustle you in the door or sell you with a\nflashy website. It’s a classic “discovery brand.” Jim Meehan, the wizard behind Please Don’t Tell’s\ncocktail menu, designed the customer experience with that goal in mind. “The most powerful\nmarketing is personal recommendation,” he said. “Nothing is more viral or infectious than one of your\nfriends going to a place and giving it his full recommendation.” And what could be more remarkable\nthan watching two people disappear into the back of a phone booth?\n—————\nIn case it’s not already clear, here’s a little secret about secrets: they tend not to stay secret very\nlong.\nThink about the last time someone shared a secret with you. Remember how earnestly she begged\nyou not to tell a soul? And remember what you did next?\nWell, if you’re like most people, you probably went and told someone else. (Don’t be\nembarrassed, your secret is safe with me.) As it turns out, if something is supposed to be secret,\npeople might well be more likely to talk about it. The reason? Social currency.\nPeople share things that make them look good to others.\nMINTING A NEW TYPE OF CURRENCY\nKids love art projects. Whether drawing with crayons, gluing elbow macaroni to sheets of\nconstruction paper, or building elaborate sculptures out of recyclables, they revel in the joy of making\nthings. But whatever the type of project, media, or venue, kids all seem to do the same thing once they\nare finished.\nThey show someone else.\n“Self-sharing” follows us throughout our lives. We tell friends about our new clothing purchases\nand show family members the op-ed piece we’re sending to the local newspaper. This desire to share\nour thoughts, opinions, and experiences is one reason social media and online social networks have\nbecome so popular. People blog about their preferences, post Facebook status updates about what\nthey ate for lunch, and tweet about why they hate the current government. As many observers have\ncommented, today’s social-network-addicted people can’t seem to stop sharing—what they think,\nlike, and want—with everyone, all the time.\nIndeed, research finds that more than 40 percent of what people talk about is their personal\nexperiences or personal relationships. Similarly, around half of tweets are “me” focused, covering\nwhat people are doing now or something that has happened to them. Why do people talk so much\nabout their own attitudes and experiences?\nIt’s more than just vanity; we’re actually wired to find it pleasurable. Harvard neuroscientists\nJason Mitchell and Diana Tamir found that disclosing information about the self is intrinsically\nrewarding. In one study, Mitchell and Tamir hooked subjects up to brain scanners and asked them to\nshare either their own opinions and attitudes (“I like snowboarding”) or the opinions and attitudes of\nanother person (“He likes puppies”). They found that sharing personal opinions activated the same\nbrain circuits that respond to rewards like food and money. So talking about what you did this\nweekend might feel just as good as taking a delicious bite of double chocolate cake.\nIn fact, people like sharing their attitudes so much that they are even willing to pay money to do it.\nIn another study, Tamir and Mitchell asked people to complete a number of trials of a basic choice\ntask. Participants could choose either to hang out for a few seconds or answer a question about\nthemselves (such as “How much do you like sandwiches?”) and share it with others. Respondents\nmade hundreds of these quick choices. But to make it even more interesting, Tamir and Mitchell\nvaried the amount that people got paid for choosing a particular option. In some trials people could\nget paid a couple of cents more for choosing to wait for a few seconds. In others they could get paid a\ncouple of cents more for choosing to self-disclose.\nThe result? People were willing to forgo money to share their opinions. Overall, they were willing\nto take a 25 percent pay cut to share their thoughts. Compared with doing nothing for five seconds,\npeople valued sharing their opinion at just under a cent. This puts a new spin on an old maxim. Maybe\ninstead of giving people a penny for their thoughts, we should get paid a penny for listening.\n—————\nIt’s clear that people like to talk about themselves, but what makes people talk about some of their\nthoughts and experiences more than others?\nPlay a game with me for a minute. My colleague Carla drives a minivan. I could tell you many\nother things about her, but for now, I want to see how much you can deduce based solely on the fact\nthat she drives a minivan. How old is Carla? Is she twenty-two? Thirty-five? Fifty-seven? I know you\nknow very little about her, but try to make an educated guess.\nDoes she have any kids? If so, do they play sports? Any idea what sports they play?\nOnce you’ve made a mental note of your guesses, let’s talk about my friend Todd. He’s a really\ncool guy. He also happens to have a Mohawk. Any idea what he’s like? How old he is? What type of\nmusic he likes? Where he shops?\nI’ve played this game with hundreds of people and the results are always the same. Most people\nthink Carla is somewhere between thirty and forty-five years old. All of them—yes, 100 percent—\nbelieve she has kids. Most are convinced those kids play sports, and almost everyone who believes\nthat guesses that soccer is the sport of choice. All that from a minivan.\nNow Todd. Most people agree that he’s somewhere between fifteen and thirty. The majority guess\nthat he’s into some sort of edgy music, whether punk, heavy metal, or rock. And almost everyone\nthinks he buys vintage clothes or shops at some sort of surf/skate store. All this from a haircut.\nLet’s be clear. Todd doesn’t have to listen to edgy music or shop at Hot Topic. He could be fiftythree\nyears old, listen to Beethoven, and buy his clothes at any other place he wanted. It’s not like\nGap would bar the door if he tried to buy chinos.\nThe same thing is true of Carla. She could be a twenty-two-year-old riot grrrl who plays drums and\nbelieves kids are for the boring bourgeoisie.\nBut the point is that we didn’t think those things about Carla and Todd. Rather, we all made similar\ninferences because choices signal identity. Carla drives a minivan, so we assumed she was a soccer\nmom. Todd has a Mohawk, so we guessed he’s a young punk-type guy. We make educated guesses\nabout other people based on the cars they drive, the clothes they wear, and the music they listen to.\nWhat people talk about also affects what others think of them. Telling a funny joke at a party makes\npeople think we’re witty. Knowing all the info about last night’s big game or celebrity dance-off\nmakes us seem cool or in the know.\nSo, not surprisingly, people prefer sharing things that make them seem entertaining rather than\nboring, clever rather than dumb, and hip rather than dull. Consider the flip side. Think about the last\ntime you considered sharing something but didn’t. Chances are you didn’t talk about it because it\nwould have made you (or someone else) look bad. We talk about how we got a reservation at the\nhottest restaurant in town and skip the story about how the hotel we chose faced a parking lot. We talk\nabout how the camera we picked was a Consumer Reports Best Buy and skip the story about how the\nlaptop we bought ended up being cheaper at another store.\nWord of mouth, then, is a prime tool for making a good impression—as potent as that new car or\nPrada handbag. Think of it as a kind of currency. Social currency. Just as people use money to buy\nproducts or services, they use social currency to achieve desired positive impressions among their\nfamilies, friends, and colleagues.\nSo to get people talking, companies and organizations need to mint social currency. Give people a\nway to make themselves look good while promoting their products and ideas along the way. There\nare three ways to do that: (1) find inner remarkability; (2) leverage game mechanics; and (3) make\npeople feel like insiders.\nINNER REMARKABILITY\nImagine it’s a sweltering day and you and a friend stop by a convenience store to buy some drinks.\nYou’re tired of soda but you feel like something with more flavor than just water. Something light and\nrefreshing. As you scan the drink case, a pink lemonade Snapple catches your eye. Perfect. You grab\nit and take it up to the cash register to pay.\nOnce outside, you twist the top off and take a long drink. Feeling sufficiently revitalized, you’re\nabout to get in your friend’s car when you notice something written on the inside of the Snapple cap.\nReal Fact # 27: A ball of glass will bounce higher than a ball of rubber.\nWow. Really?\nYou’d probably be pretty impressed (after all, who even knew glass could bounce), but think for a\nmoment about what you’d do next. What would you do with this newfound tidbit of information?\nWould you keep it to yourself or would you tell your friend?\n—————\nIn 2002, Marke Rubenstein, executive VP of Snapple’s ad agency, was trying to think of new ways\nto entertain Snapple customers. Snapple was already known for its quirky TV ads featuring the\nSnapple Lady, a peppy, middle-aged woman with a thick New York accent, who read and answered\nletters from Snapple fans. She was a real Snapple employee, and the letter writers ranged from\npeople asking for dating advice to people soliciting Snapple to host a soiree at a senior citizens\nhome. The ads were pretty funny, and Snapple was looking for something similarly clever and\neccentric.\nDuring a marketing meeting, someone suggested that the space under the cap was unused real\nestate. Snapple had tried putting jokes under the cap with little success. But the jokes were terrible\n(“If the #2 pencil is the most popular, why is it still #2?”), so it was hard to tell if it was the strategy\nor the jokes that were failing. Rubenstein and her team wondered whether real facts might work\nbetter. Something “out of the ordinary that [Snapple drinkers] wouldn’t know and wouldn’t even\nknow they’d want to know.”\nSo Rubenstein and her team came up with a long list of clever trivia facts and began putting them\nunder the caps—visible only after customers have purchased and opened the bottles.\nFact #12, for example, notes that kangaroos can’t walk backward. Fact #73 says that the average\nperson spends two weeks over his/her lifetime waiting for traffic lights to change.\nThese facts are so surprising and entertaining that it’s hard not to want to share them with someone\nelse. Two weeks waiting for the light to change? That’s unbelievable! How do they even calculate\nsomething like that? Think of what else we could do with that time! If you’ve ever happened to drink\na Snapple with a friend, you’ll find yourself telling each other which fact you received—similar to\nwhat happens when your family breaks open fortune cookies after a meal at a Chinese restaurant.\nSnapple facts are so infectious that they’ve become embedded in popular culture. Hundreds of\nwebsites chronicle the various facts. Comedians poke fun at them in their routines. Some of the facts\nare so unbelievable that people even debate back and forth whether they are actually correct. (Yes,\nthe idea that kangaroos can’t walk backward does seem pretty crazy, but it’s true.)\nDid you know that frowning burns more calories than smiling? That an ant can lift fifty times its\nown weight? You probably didn’t. But people share these and similar Snapple facts because they are\nremarkable. And talking about remarkable things provides social currency.\n—————\nRemarkable things are defined as unusual, extraordinary, or worthy of notice or attention.\nSomething can be remarkable because it is novel, surprising, extreme, or just plain interesting. But the\nmost important aspect of remarkable things is that they are worthy of remark. Worthy of mention.\nLearning that a ball of glass will bounce higher than a ball of rubber is just so noteworthy that you\nhave to mention it.\nRemarkable things provide social currency because they make the people who talk about them\nseem, well, more remarkable. Some people like to be the life of the party, but no one wants to be the\ndeath of it. We all want to be liked. The desire for social approval is a fundamental human\nmotivation. If we tell someone a cool Snapple fact it makes us seem more engaging. If we tell\nsomeone about a secret bar hidden inside a hot dog restaurant, it makes us seem cool. Sharing\nextraordinary, novel, or entertaining stories or ads makes people seem more extraordinary, novel, and\nentertaining. It makes them more fun to talk to, more likely to get asked to lunch, and more likely to get\ninvited back for a second date.\nNot surprisingly, then, remarkable things get brought up more often. In one study, Wharton\nprofessor Raghu Iyengar and I analyzed how much word of mouth different companies, products, and\nbrands get online. We examined a huge list of 6,500 products and brands. Everything from big brands\nlike Wells Fargo and Facebook to small brands like the Village Squire Restaurants and Jack Link’s.\nFrom every industry you can imagine. Banking and bagel shops to dish soaps and department stores.\nThen we asked people to score the remarkability of each product or brand and analyzed how these\nperceptions were correlated with how frequently they were discussed.\nThe verdict was clear: more remarkable products like Facebook or Hollywood movies were\ntalked about almost twice as often as less remarkable brands like Wells Fargo and Tylenol. Other\nresearch finds similar effects. More interesting tweets are shared more, and more interesting or\nsurprising articles are more likely to make the New York Times Most E-Mailed list.\nRemarkability explains why people share videos of eight-year-old girls flawlessly reciting rap\nlyrics and why my aunt forwarded me a story about a coyote who was hit by a car, got stuck in the\nbumper for six hundred miles, and survived. It even explains why doctors talk about some patients\nmore than others. Every time there is a patient in the ER with an unusual story (such as someone\nswallowing a weird foreign object), everyone in the hospital hears about it. A code pink (baby\nabduction) makes big news even if it’s a false alarm, while a code blue (cardiac arrest) goes largely\nunmentioned.\nRemarkability also shapes how stories evolve over time. A group of psychologists from the\nUniversity of Illinois recruited pairs of students for what seemed like a study of group planning and\nperformance. Students were told they would get to cook a small meal together and were escorted to a\nreal working kitchen. In front of them were all the ingredients necessary to cook a meal. Piles of leafy\ngreen vegetables, fresh chicken, and succulent pink shrimp, all ready to be chopped and thrown into a\npan. But then things got interesting. Hidden among the vegetables and chicken, the researchers had\nplanted a small—but decidedly creepy—family of cockroaches. Eww! The students shrieked and\nrecoiled from the food.\nAfter the bedlam subsided, the experimenter said that someone must be playing a joke on them and\nquickly canceled the study. But rather than send people home early, he suggested that they go\nparticipate in another study that was (conveniently) taking place just next door.\nThey all walked over, but along the way they were quizzed about what had happened during the\naborted experiment. Half were asked by the experimenter, while the other half were asked by what\nseemed like another student (who was actually covertly helping the experimenter).\nDepending on whom participants happened to tell the story to, it came out differently. If they were\ntalking to another student—that is, if they were trying to impress and entertain rather than simply\nreport the facts—the cockroaches were larger, more numerous, and the entire experience more\ndisgusting. The students exaggerated the details to make the story more remarkable.\nWe’ve all had similar experiences. How big was the trout we caught last time we went fishing in\nColorado? How many times did the baby wake up crying during the night?\nOften we’re not even trying to exaggerate; we just can’t recall all the details of the story. Our\nmemories aren’t perfect records of what happened. They’re more like dinosaur skeletons patched\ntogether by archeologists. We have the main chunks, but some of the pieces are missing, so we fill\nthem in as best we can. We make an educated guess.\nBut in the process, stories often become more extreme or entertaining, particularly when people\ntell them in front of a group. We don’t just guess randomly, we fill in numbers or information to make\nus look good rather than inept. The fish doubles in size. The baby didn’t wake just twice during the\nnight—that wouldn’t be remarkable enough—she woke seven times and required skillful parenting\neach time to soothe her back to sleep.\nIt’s just like a game of telephone. As the story gets transmitted from person to person, some details\nfall out and others are exaggerated. And it becomes more and more remarkable along the way.\n—————\nThe key to finding inner remarkability is to think about what makes something interesting,\nsurprising, or novel. Can the product do something no one would have thought possible (such as blend\ngolf balls like Blendtec)? Are the consequences of the idea or issue more extreme than people ever\ncould have imagined?\nOne way to generate surprise is by breaking a pattern people have come to expect. Take low-cost\nairlines. What do you expect when you fly a low-cost carrier? Small seats, no movies, limited snacks,\nand a generally no-frills experience. But people who fly JetBlue for the first time often tell others\nbecause the experience is remarkably different. You get a large, comfortable seat, a variety of snack\nchoices (from Terra Blues chips to animal crackers), and free DIRECTV programming from your\nown seat-back television. Similarly, by using Kobe beef and lobster, and charging one hundred\ndollars, Barclay Prime got buzz by breaking the pattern of what people expected from a cheesesteak.\nMysteries and controversy are also often remarkable. The Blair Witch Project is one of the most\nfamous examples of this approach. Released in 1999, the film tells the story of three student\nfilmmakers who hiked into the mountains of Maryland to film a documentary about a local legend\ncalled the Blair Witch. They supposedly disappeared, however, and viewers were told that the film\nwas pieced together from “rediscovered” amateur footage that was shot on their hike. No one was\nsure if this was true.\nWhat do we do when confronted with a controversial mystery like this? Naturally, we ask others to\nhelp us sort out the answer. So the film garnered a huge buzz simply from people wondering whether\nit depicted real events or not. It undermined a fundamental belief (that witches don’t exist), so people\nwanted the answer, and the fact that there was disagreement led to even more discussion. The buzz\ndrove the movie to become a blockbuster. Shot on a handheld camera with a budget of about $35,000,\nthe movie grossed more than $248 million worldwide.\nThe best thing about remarkability, though, is that it can be applied to anything. You might think that\na product, service, or idea would have to be inherently remarkable—that remarkability isn’t\nsomething you can impose from the outside. New high-tech gadgets or Hollywood movies are\nnaturally more remarkable than, say, customer service guidelines or toasters. What could be\nremarkable about a toaster?\nBut it’s possible to find the inner remarkability in any product or idea by thinking about what\nmakes that thing stand out. Remember Blendtec, the blender company we talked about in the\nIntroduction? By finding the product’s inner remarkability, the company was able to get millions of\npeople to talk about a boring old blender. And they were able to do it with no advertising and a fiftydollar\nmarketing budget.\nToilet paper? Hardly seems remarkable. But a few years ago I made toilet paper one of the most\ntalked-about conversation topics at a party. How? I put a roll of black toilet paper in the bathroom.\nBlack toilet paper? No one had ever seen black toilet paper before. And that remarkability provoked\ndiscussion. Emphasize what’s remarkable about a product or idea and people will talk.\nLEVERAGE GAME MECHANICS\nI was short by 222 miles.\nA few years ago I was booking a round-trip flight from the East Coast to California. It was late\nDecember, and the end of the year is always slow, so it seemed like a perfect time to visit friends. I\nwent online, scanned a bunch of options, and found a direct flight that was cheaper than the connecting\nones. Lucky me! I went to go find my credit card.\nBut as I entered my frequent flier number, information about my status tier appeared on the screen. I\nfly a decent amount, and the previous year I had flown enough on United Airlines to achieve Premier\nstatus. Calling the perks I was receiving “Premier” seemed like a marketing person’s idea of a sick\njoke, but it was slightly better treatment than you usually get in economy class. I could check bags for\nfree, have access to seats with slightly more leg room, and theoretically get free upgrades to business\nclass (though that never actually seemed to happen). Nothing to write home about, but at least I didn’t\nhave to pay to check a bag.\nThis year had been even busier. I tend to stick with one airline if I can, and in this case, it seemed it\nmight just pay off. I had almost achieved the next status level: Premier Executive.\nBut the key word here is “almost.” I was 222 miles short. Even with the direct flights to California\nand back, I wouldn’t have enough miles to make it to Premier Executive.\nThe perks for being a Premier Executive were only slightly better than those for Premier. I’d get to\ncheck a third bag for free, have access to special airline lounges if I flew internationally, and board\nthe plane seconds earlier than I would have before. Nothing too exciting.\nBut I was so close! And I had only a few days left to fly the required extra miles. This trip to San\nFrancisco was my last chance.\nSo I did what people do who are so focused on achieving something that they lose their common\nsense. I paid more money to book a connecting flight.\nRather than take a direct flight home, I flew a circuitous route, stopping in Boston for two hours\njust to make sure I had enough miles to make it over the threshold.\n—————\nThe first major frequent flier program was created in 1981 by American Airlines. Originally\nconceptualized as a method to give special fares to frequent customers, the program soon morphed\ninto the current system of rewards. Today, more than 180 million people accumulate frequent flier\nmiles when they travel. These programs have motivated millions of people to pledge their loyalty to a\nsingle airline and stop over in random cities or fly at inopportune times just to ensure that they accrue\nmiles on their desired carrier.\nWe all know that miles can be redeemed for free travel, hotel stays, and other perks. Still, most\npeople never cash in the miles they accumulate. In fact, less than 10 percent of miles are redeemed\nevery year. Experts estimate that as many as 10 trillion frequent flier miles are sitting in accounts,\nunused. Enough to travel to the moon and back 19.4 million times. That’s a lot of miles.\nSo if they’re not actually using them, why are people so passionate about racking up miles?\nBecause it’s a fun game.\n—————\nThink about your favorite game. It can be a board game, a sport, or even a computer game or an\napp. Maybe you love solitaire, enjoy playing golf, or go crazy for Sudoku puzzles. Ever stopped to\nthink about why you enjoy these games so much? Why you can’t seem to stop playing?\nGame mechanics are the elements of a game, application, or program—including rules and\nfeedback loops—that make them fun and compelling. You get points for doing well at solitaire, there\nare levels of Sudoku puzzles, and golf tournaments have leaderboards. These elements tell players\nwhere they stand in the game and how well they are doing. Good game mechanics keep people\nengaged, motivated, and always wanting more.\nOne way game mechanics motivate is internally. We all enjoy achieving things. Tangible evidence\nof our progress, such as solving a tough Solitaire game or advancing to the next level of Sudoku\npuzzles, makes us feel good. So discrete markers motivate us to work harder, especially when we get\nclose to achieving them. Take the buy-ten-get-one-free coffee punch cards that are sometimes offered\nat local cafés. By increasing motivation, the cards actually spur people to buy coffee more frequently\nas they get closer to their tenth cup and claiming their reward.\nBut game mechanics also motivate us on an interpersonal level by encouraging social comparison.\nA few years ago, students at Harvard University were asked to make a seemingly straightforward\nchoice: which would they prefer, a job where they made $50,000 a year (option A) or one where they\nmade $100,000 a year (option B)?\nSeems like a no-brainer, right? Everyone should take option B. But there was one catch. In option\nA, the students would get paid twice as much as others, who would only get $25,000. In option B,\nthey would get paid half as much as others, who would get $200,000. So option B would make the\nstudents more money overall, but they would be doing worse than others around them.\nWhat did the majority of people choose?\nOption A. They preferred to do better than others, even if it meant getting less for themselves. They\nchose the option that was worse in absolute terms but better in relative terms.\nPeople don’t just care about how they are doing, they care about their performance in relation to\nothers. Getting to board a plane a few minutes early is a nice perk of achieving Premier status. But\npart of what makes this a nice perk is that you get to board before everyone else. Because levels work\non two, well, levels. They tell us where we are at any time in absolute terms. But they also make\nclear where we stand relative to everyone else.\nJust like many other animals, people care about hierarchy. Apes engage in status displays and dogs\ntry to figure out who is the alpha. Humans are no different. We like feeling that we’re high status, top\ndog, or leader of the pack. But status is inherently relational. Being leader of the pack requires a\npack, doing better than others.\nGame mechanics help generate social currency because doing well makes us look good. People\nlove boasting about the things they’ve accomplished: their golf handicaps, how many people follow\nthem on Twitter, or their kids’ SAT scores. A friend of mine is a Delta Airlines Platinum Medallion\nmember. Every time he flies he finds a way to brag about it on Facebook. Talking about how a guy he\nsaw in the Delta Sky Club lounge is hitting on a waitress. Or mentioning the free upgrade he got to\nfirst class. After all, what good is status if no one else knows you have it?\nBut every time he proudly shares his status, he’s also spreading the word about Delta.\nAnd this is how game mechanics boosts word of mouth. People are talking because they want to\nshow off their achievements, but along the way they talk about the brands (Delta or Twitter) or\ndomains (golf or the SAT) where they achieved.\nBuilding a Good Game\nLeveraging game mechanics requires quantifying performance. Some domains like golf handicaps and\nSAT scores have built-in metrics. People can easily see how they are doing and compare themselves\nwith others without needing any help. But if a product or idea doesn’t automatically do that, it needs\nto be “gamified.” Metrics need to be created or recorded that let people see where they stand—for\nexample, icons for how much they have contributed to a community message board or different\ncolored tickets for season ticket holders.\nAirlines have done this nicely. Frequent flier programs didn’t always exist. True, people have\nflown commercially for more than half a century. But flying was gamified relatively recently, with\nairlines recording miles flown and awarding status levels. And because this provides social\ncurrency, people love to talk about it.\nLeveraging game mechanics also involves helping people publicize their achievements. Sure,\nsomeone can talk about how well she did, but it’s even better if there is a tangible, visible symbol\nthat she can display to others. Foursquare, the location-based social networking website, lets users\ncheck in at bars, restaurants, and other locations using their mobile devices. Checking in helps people\nfind their friends, but Foursquare also awards special badges to users based on their check-in history.\nCheck in to the same venue more than anyone else in a sixty-day period and you’ll be crowned the\nmayor of that location. Check in to five different airports and get a Jetsetter badge. Not only are these\nbadges posted on users’ Foursquare accounts, but because they provide social currency, users also\nprominently display them on their Facebook pages.\nJust like my Platinum Medallion friend, people display their badges to show off or because they’re\nproud of themselves. But along the way they are also spreading the Foursquare brand.\nGreat game mechanics can even create achievement out of nothing. Airlines turned loyalty into a\nstatus symbol. Foursquare made it a mark of distinction to be a fixture at the corner bar. And by\nencouraging players to post their achievements on Facebook, online game makers have managed to\nconvince people to proclaim loudly—even boast—that they spend hours playing computer games\nevery day.\n—————\nEffective status systems are easy to understand, even by people who aren’t familiar with the\ndomain. Being the mayor sounds good, but if you asked most people on the street, I bet they couldn’t\ntell you whether that is better or worse than having a School Night badge, a Super User badge, or any\none of the more than one hundred other badges Foursquare offers.\nCredit card companies struggled with the same issue. Gold cards used to be restricted to people\nwho spent heavily and had a stellar credit history. But as companies started offering them to people\nwith all types of credit, the gold card lost its meaning. So companies came up with new options for\ntheir truly wealthy customers: the platinum card, the sapphire card, and the diamond card, among\nothers. But which has more status, a diamond or a sapphire card? Is platinum better or worse than\nsapphire? This bewildering mix of colors, minerals, and exclusive words creates a chaos of\nconsumer confusion such that people don’t know how well they are doing—much less how they\ncompare with anyone else.\nContrast that with medals given out at the Olympics or your local track meet. If entrants tell you\nthey won silver, you know exactly how well they did. Even someone who knows almost nothing about\ntrack can tell right away whether an entrant is a star or just doing okay.\nMany British supermarkets use a similarly intuitive labeling system. Just as with stoplights, they\nuse red, yellow, or green circles to denote how much sugar, fat, and salt are in different products.\nLow-sodium sandwiches are marked with a green circle for salt while salty soups get a red circle.\nAnyone can immediately pick up on the system and understand how to behave as a result.\n—————\nMany contests also involve game mechanics. Burberry created a website called “Art of the\nTrench” that is a montage of Burberry and all the people who wear it. Some photos were taken by the\nworld’s leading photographers, but people can also send in photos of themselves or their friends\nwearing the iconic Burberry trench coat. If you’re lucky, Burberry posts your image on its website.\nYour photo then becomes part of a set of images reflecting personal style from across the globe.\nImagine if your photo was picked for the site. What would be your first impulse? You’d tell\nsomeone else! And not just one person. Lots of people.\nAs apparently everyone did. The Burberry site garnered millions of views from more than a\nhundred different countries. And the contest helped drive sales up 50 percent.\nRecipe websites encourage people to post photos of their finished meals. Weight loss or fitness\nprograms encourage before-and-after photos so people can show others how much better they look. A\nnew bar in D.C. even named a drink, the Kentucky Irby, after my best friend (his last name is Irby).\nHe felt so special he told everyone he knows about the drink and along the way helped spread the\nword about this new establishment.\nGiving awards works on a similar principle. Recipients of awards love boasting about them—it\ngives them the opportunity to tell others how great they are. But along the way they have to mention\nwho gave them the award.\nWord of mouth can also come from the voting process itself. Deciding the winner by popular vote\nencourages contestants to drum up support. But in telling people to vote for them, contestants also\nspread awareness about the product, brand, or initiative sponsoring the contest. Instead of marketing\nitself directly, the company uses the contest to get people who want to win to do the marketing\nthemselves.\nAnd this brings us to the third way to generate social currency: making people feel like insiders.\nMAKE PEOPLE FEEL LIKE INSIDERS\nIn 2005, Ben Fischman became CEO of SmartBargains.com. The discount shopping website sold\neverything from apparel and bedding to home decor and luggage. The business model was\nstraightforward: companies wanting to offload clearance items or extra merchandise would sell them\ncheap to SmartBargains, and SmartBargains would pass the deals on to the consumer. There was a\nbroad variety of merchandise, and prices were often up to 75 percent lower than retail.\nBut by 2007 the website was floundering. Margins had always been low, but excitement about the\nbrand had dissipated, and momentum was slowing. A number of related websites had also sprung up,\nand SmartBargains was struggling to differentiate itself from similar competitors.\nA year later Fischman started a new website called Rue La La. It carried high-end designer goods\nbut focused on “flash sales” in which the deals were available for only a limited time—twenty-four\nhours or a couple of days at most. And the site followed the same model as sample sales in the\nfashion industry. Access was by invitation only. You had to be invited by an existing member.\nSales took off, and the site did extremely well. So well, in fact, that in 2009 Ben sold both\nwebsites for $350 million.\nRue La La’s success is particularly noteworthy, given one tiny detail.\nIt sold the same products as SmartBargains. The exact same dresses, skirts, and suits. The same\nshoes, shirts, and slacks.\nSo what transformed what could have been a ho-hum website into one people were clamoring to\nget access to? How come Rue La La was so much more successful?\nBecause it made people feel like insiders.\n—————\nWhen trying to figure out how to save SmartBargains, Fischman noticed that one part of the\nbusiness was doing incredibly well. Its Smart Shopper loyalty club allowed people who signed up to\nget reduced shipping fees and access to a private shopping area. Deals that no one else could see. It\nwas a small part of the site, but growth was through the roof.\nAt the same time, Fischman learned about a concept in France called vente privée, or private sale.\nOnline flash sales that were available only for a day. Fischman decided that this was the perfect way\nto put a unique spin on his business.\nAnd it was. Rue La La hit the ground running because it smartly leveraged the urgency factor. Part\nof this started by accident. Every morning the site posted new deals at 11:00 a.m. But in the first\ncouple of months demand was so much higher than expected that by 11:03 a.m. everything would be\nsold out. Gone. So customers learned that if they didn’t get there right away, they’d miss out.\nAs it has grown, Rue La La has maintained this limited availability. It still sells out 40 percent to\n50 percent of items in the first hour. Sales have grown, but it’s not that revenue gets bigger across the\ncourse of the day. The traffic spikes at 11:00 a.m. have simply reached higher and higher levels.\nGoing to a membership-only model also made the site’s members feel like insiders. Just as with the\nvelvet rope that prevents regular partygoers from just walking into an exclusive nightclub, people\nassumed that if you had to be a member, the site must be really desirable.\nRue La La’s members are its best ambassadors. They proselytize better than any ad campaign ever\ncould. As Fischman noted:\nIt’s like the concierge at a hotel. You go down to the concierge to find out about a restaurant\nand he tells you a name right away. The assumption is that he is getting paid to suggest that\nplace and the restaurant is probably mediocre. But if a friend recommends a place you can’t\nwait to get there. Well when a friend tells you you’ve gotta try Rue La La, you believe them.\nAnd you try it.\nRue La La unleashed the power of friends telling friends.\n—————\nWhile it might not be obvious right away, Rue La La actually has a lot in common with Please\nDon’t Tell, the secret bar we talked about at the beginning of the chapter. Both used scarcity and\nexclusivity to make customers feel like insiders.\nScarcity is about how much of something is offered. Scarce things are less available because of\nhigh demand, limited production, or restrictions on the time or place you can acquire them. The secret\nbar Please Don’t Tell has only forty-five seats and doesn’t allow more people than that in. Rue La\nLa’s deals were available for only twenty-four hours; some are even gone within thirty minutes.\nExclusivity is also about availability, but in a different way. Exclusive things are accessible only\nto people who meet particular criteria. When we think of exclusivity, we tend to think of flashy\n$20,000 diamond-encrusted Rolexes or hobnobbing in St. Croix with movie stars. But exclusivity\nisn’t just about money or celebrity. It’s also about knowledge. Knowing certain information or being\nconnected to people who do. And that is where Please Don’t Tell and Rue La La come in. You don’t\nhave to be a celebrity to get into Please Don’t Tell, but because it is hidden, only certain people know\nit exists. Money can’t buy you access to Rue La La. Access is by invitation only, so you have to know\nan existing user.\nScarcity and exclusivity help products catch on by making them seem more desirable. If something\nis difficult to obtain, people assume that it must be worth the effort. If something is unavailable or\nsold out, people often infer that lots of other people must like it, and so it must be pretty good\n(something we’ll talk more about in the Public chapter). People evaluate cookbooks more favorably\nwhen they are in limited supply, find cookies tastier when they are scarce, and perceive pantyhose as\nhigher end when it’s less available.\nDisney uses this same concept to increase demand for decades-old movies. It takes prime animated\nfeatures like Snow White and Pinocchio off the market and puts them in the “Disney Vault” until it\ndecides to reissue them. This limited availability makes us feel like we have to act now. If we don’t\nwe might miss the opportunity even if we might not have otherwise wanted the opportunity in the first\nplace.*\nScarcity and exclusivity boost word of mouth by making people feel like insiders. If people get\nsomething not everyone else has, it makes them feel special, unique, high status. And because of that\nthey’ll not only like a product or service more, but tell others about it. Why? Because telling others\nmakes them look good. Having insider knowledge is social currency. When people who waited hours\nin line finally get that new tech gadget, one of the first things they do is show others. Look at me and\nwhat I was able to get!\nAnd lest you think that only exclusive categories like bars and clothes can benefit from making\npeople feel like insiders, let me tell you about how McDonald’s created social currency around a mix\nthat includes tripe, heart, and stomach meat.\n—————\nIn 1979, McDonald’s introduced Chicken McNuggets. They were a huge hit and every franchise\nacross the country wanted them. But at the time McDonald’s didn’t have an adequate system to meet\nthe demand. So Executive Chef Rene Arend was tasked with devising another new product to give to\nthe unlucky franchises that couldn’t get enough chicken. Something that would keep them happy\ndespite the shortages.\nArend came up with a pork sandwich called the McRib. He had just come back from a trip to\nCharleston, South Carolina, and was inspired by Southern barbecue. He loved the rich, smoky flavor\nand thought it would be a perfect addition to the McDonald’s menu.\nBut contrary to what the name suggests, there is actually very little rib meat on the McRib. Instead,\nimagine a pork patty shaped into something that looks like a rack of ribs. Subtract the bones (and most\nof the higher-quality meat), add barbecue sauce, top it off with onions and pickles, toss it in a bun,\nand you pretty much have the McRib.\nLack of rib meat aside, the product test-marketed quite well. McDonald’s was excited and soon\nadded the product to the nationwide menu. McRibs were everywhere from Florida to Seattle.\nBut then the sales numbers came in. Unfortunately, they were much lower than expected.\nMcDonald’s tried promotions and features, but not much worked. So after a few years it dropped the\nMcRib, citing Americans’ lack of interest in pork.\nA decade later, however, McDonald’s figured out a clever way to increase demand for the McRib.\nIt didn’t spend more money on advertising. It didn’t change the price. It didn’t even change the\ningredients.\nIt just made the product scarce.\nSometimes it would bring the product back nationally for a limited time; in other cases it would\noffer it at certain locations but not others. One month it would be offered only at franchises in Kansas\nCity, Atlanta, and Los Angeles. Two months later it would be offered only in Chicago, Dallas, and\nTampa.\nAnd its strategy worked. Consumers got excited about the sandwich. Facebook groups started\npopping up asking the company to “bring back the McRib!” Supporters used Twitter to proclaim their\nlove for the snack (“Lucky me, the McRib is back”) and to learn where they could find one (“I only\nreally use Twitter to find out when the McRib is available”). Someone even created an online McRib\nlocator so fans could share locations that offered the sandwich with others. All for what is mostly a\nmix of tripe, heart, and stomach meat.\nMaking people feel like insiders can benefit all types of products and ideas. Regardless of whether\nthe product is hip and cool, or a mix of leftover pig parts. The mere fact that something isn’t readily\navailable can make people value it more and tell others to capitalize on the social currency of\nknowing about it or having it.\nA BRIEF NOTE ON MOTIVATION\nA few years ago I went through a fundamental male rite of passage. I joined a fantasy football league.\nFantasy football has become one of America’s most popular unofficial pastimes. For those\nunfamiliar with the game, it’s essentially like being the general manager of an imaginary team.\nMillions of people spend countless hours scouting players, tweaking their rosters, and watching their\nperformance each week.\nIt always seemed funny to me that people spent so much time on what is essentially a spectator\nsport. But when a group of friends needed one more person and asked me if I’d play, I said why not.\nAnd sure enough, I got sucked in. I spent hours every week scanning through cheat sheets, reading\nup on players I’d never heard of, and trying to find sleepers other people hadn’t drafted. Once the\nseason started I found myself watching football, something I had never done before. And it wasn’t to\nsee whether my local team won. I was watching teams I knew nothing about, checking out which of\nmy players were doing better, and tweaking my roster each week.\nBut the most interesting part?\nI did this all for free.\nNo one paid me for the hours I spent, and my friends and I didn’t even have a bet riding on the\noutcome. We were just playing for fun. And, of course, bragging rights. But since doing better than\nothers is social currency, everyone was motivated to do well. Even without a monetary incentive.\nThe moral? People don’t need to be paid to be motivated. Managers often default to monetary\nincentives when trying to motivate employees. Some gift or other perk to get people to take action.\nBut that’s the wrong way to think about it. Lots of people will refer a friend if you pay them a hundred\ndollars to do so. Offer people the chance to win a gold Lamborghini and they’ll do almost anything.\nBut as with many monetary incentives, handing out gold Lamborghinis is costly.\nFurthermore, as soon as you pay people for doing something, you crowd out their intrinsic\nmotivation. People are happy to talk about companies and products they like, and millions of people\ndo it for free every day, without prompting. But as soon as you offer to pay people to refer other\ncustomers, any interest they had in doing it for free will disappear. Customers’ decisions to share or\nnot will no longer be based on how much they like a product or service. Instead, the quality and\nquantity of buzz will be proportional to the money they receive.\nSocial incentives, like social currency, are more effective in the long term. Foursquare doesn’t pay\nusers to check in to bars, and airlines don’t give discounts to frequent flier members. But by\nharnessing people’s desire to look good to others, their customers did these things anyway—and\nspread word of mouth for free.\nPLEASE DON’T TELL? WELL, OKAY. MAYBE JUST ONE PERSON . . .\nHow do we get people talking and make our products and ideas catch on? One way is to mint social\ncurrency. People like to make a good impression, so we need to make our products a way to achieve\nthat. Like Blendtec’s Will It Blend? we need to find the inner remarkability. Like Foursquare or\nairlines with frequent flier tiers, we need to leverage game mechanics. Like Rue La La, we need to\nuse scarcity and exclusivity to make people feel as if they’re insiders.\nThe drive to talk about ourselves brings us back full circle to Please Don’t Tell. The proprietors\nare smart. They understand that secrets boost social currency, but they don’t stop there. After you’ve\npaid for your drinks, your server hands you a small business card. All black, almost like the calling\ncard of a psychic or wizard. In red script the card simply says “Please Don’t Tell” and includes a\nphone number.\nSo while everything else suggests the proprietors want to keep the venue under wraps, at the end of\nthe experience they make sure you have their phone number. Just in case you want to share their\nsecret.\n* Note that making access difficult is different from making it impossible. Sure, getting a reservation at Please Don’t Tell is tough, but if\npeople call enough they should be able to snag a reservation. And while Rue La La is open only to members, it recently instituted a policy\nwhere even nonmembers can get access by signing up with an e-mail address. Using scarcity and exclusivity early on and then relaxing\nthe restrictions later is a particularly good way to build demand.\nAlso be wary of how restricting availability can come off as snooty or standoffish. People are used to getting what they want and if\nthey hear “no” too much they may go elsewhere. Jim Meehan at Please Don’t Tell addresses this problem explicitly by instructing his\nstaff that if they need to say “no” they should try to figure out a way to say “no, but.” Such as, “No, we are all booked up at eight-thirty,\nunfortunately, but how about eleven?” or “No, we don’t have brand X but we have brand Y, would you like to try it?” By managing the\ndisappointment, they maintain the allure while also maintaining customer satisfaction.\n2. Triggers\nWalt Disney World. Say those words to children under the age of eight and just wait for their\nexcited screams. More than 18 million people from all over the world visit the Orlando, Florida,\ntheme park annually. Older kids love the frightening plummet down Space Mountain and the Tower of\nTerror. Younger ones savor the magic of Cinderella’s castle and the thrill of exploring the rivers of\nAfrica in the Jungle Cruise. Even adults beam joyously when shaking hands with beloved Disney\ncharacters like Mickey Mouse and Goofy.\nMemories of my own first visit in the early 1990s still make me smile. My cousin and I were\npicked from the audience to play Gilligan and the Skipper in a reenactment of Gilligan’s Island. The\nlook of wild triumph on my face when I successfully steered the boat to safety—after being doused\nwith dozens of buckets of water—is still family lore.\nNow compare these exhilarating images with a box of Honey Nut Cheerios. Yes, the classic\nbreakfast cereal with a bee mascot that “packs the goodness of Cheerios with the irresistible taste of\ngolden honey.” Considered reasonably healthy, Honey Nut Cheerios is still sugary enough to appeal\nto children and anyone with a sweet tooth and has become a staple of many American households.\nWhich of these products—Disney World or Honey Nut Cheerios—do you think gets more word of\nmouth? The Magic Kingdom? The self-described place where dreams come true?\nOr Cheerios? The breakfast cereal made of whole grain oats that can help reduce cholesterol?\nClearly, the answer is Disney World, right? After all, talking about your adventures there is much\nmore interesting than discussing what you ate for breakfast. If word-of-mouth pundits agree on\nanything, it’s that being interesting is essential if you want people to talk. Most buzz marketing books\nwill tell you that. So will social media gurus. “Nobody talks about boring companies, boring\nproducts, or boring ads,” argues one prominent word-of-mouth advocate.\nUnfortunately, he’s wrong. And so is everyone else who subscribes to the interest-is-king theory.\nAnd lest you think this contradicts what we talked about in the previous chapter about Social\nCurrency, read on. People talk about Cheerios more than Disney World. The reason? Triggers.\nBUZZING FOR BZZAGENT\nNo one would mistake Dave Balter for a Madison Avenue shark as portrayed in the popular TV\nseries Mad Men. He’s young—just forty—and looks even younger, with downy cheeks, wire-rimmed\nglasses, and a wide-open grin. He’s also genuinely passionate about marketing. Yes, marketing. To\nDave, marketing isn’t about trying to convince people to purchase things they don’t want or need.\nMarketing is about tapping into their genuine enthusiasm for products and services that they find\nuseful. Or fun. Or beautiful. Marketing is about spreading the love.\nDave started out as a so-called loyalty marketer figuring out ways to reward customers for sticking\nwith a particular brand. He then created and sold two promotional agencies before founding his\ncurrent firm, BzzAgent.\nHere’s how BzzAgent works. Say you’re Philips, the maker of the Sonicare electric toothbrush.\nSales are good, but the product is new and most people aren’t aware of what it is or why they would\nwant to buy one. Existing Sonicare customers are beginning to spread the word, but you want to\naccelerate things, get more people talking.\nThat’s where BzzAgent comes in.\nOver the years, the company has assembled a network of more than 800,000 BzzAgents, people\nwho have said that they are interested in learning about and trying new products. Agents span a broad\nrange of ages, incomes, and occupations. Most are between eighteen and fifty-four years old, are well\neducated, and have a reasonable income. Teachers, stay-at-home moms, working professionals,\nPhDs, and even CEOs are BzzAgents.\nIf you wonder what type of person would be a BzzAgent, the answer is you. Agents reflect the U.S.\npopulation at large.\nWhen a new client calls, Dave’s team culls through its large database to find BzzAgents who fit the\ndesired demographic or psychographic profile. Philips believes its toothbrush will primarily appeal\nto busy professionals aged twenty-five to thirty-five from the East Coast? No problem, Dave has\nseveral thousand on call. You’d prefer working moms who care about dental hygiene? He’s got them,\ntoo. BzzAgent then contacts the appropriate agents in its network and invites them to join a campaign.\nThose who agree get a kit in the mail containing information about the product and coupons or a free\ntrial. Participants in the Sonicare campaign, for example, received a free toothbrush and ten-dollar\nmail-in rebates for additional toothbrushes to give to others. Participants in a Taco Bell campaign\nreceived free taco coupons. Because actual tacos are difficult to send in the mail.\nThen, over the next few months, BzzAgents file reports describing the conversations they had about\nthe product. Importantly, BzzAgents are not paid. They’re in it for the chance to get free stuff and\nlearn about new products before the rest of their friends and families. And they’re never pressured to\nsay anything other than what they honestly believe, whether they like the product or not.\n—————\nWhen people first hear about BzzAgent, some argue that it can’t possibly work. People don’t just\nspontaneously mention products in everyday conversations, they protest. It just wouldn’t seem natural.\nBut what most people don’t realize is that they naturally talk about products, brands, and\norganizations all the time. Every day, the average American engages in more than sixteen word-ofmouth\nepisodes, separate conversations where they say something positive or negative about an\norganization, brand, product, or service. We suggest restaurants to coworkers, tell family members\nabout a great sale, and recommend responsible babysitters to neighbors. American consumers\nmention specific brands more than 3 billion times a day. This kind of social talk is almost like\nbreathing. It’s so basic and frequent that we don’t even realize we’re doing it.\nIf you want to get a better sense for yourself, try keeping a conversation diary for twenty-four\nhours. Carry pen and paper with you and write down all the things you mention over the course of a\nday. You’ll be surprised at all the products and ideas you talk about.\nCurious about how a BzzCampaign worked, I joined. I’m a big fan of soy milk, so when Silk did a\ncampaign for almond milk, I had to try it. (After all, how can they get milk from an almond?) I used a\ncoupon, got the product from the store, and tried it. It was delicious.\nNot only was the product good, it was so good I simply had to tell others about it. I mentioned Silk\nalmond milk to friends who don’t drink regular milk and gave them coupons to try it themselves. Not\nbecause I had to. No one was looking over my shoulder to make sure I talked. I just liked the product\nand thought others might as well.\nAnd this is exactly why BzzAgent and other word-of-mouth marketing firms are effective. They\ndon’t force people to say nice things about products they hate. Nor do they entice people to insert\nproduct recommendations artificially into conversations. BzzAgent simply harnesses the fact that\npeople already talk about and share products and services with others. Give people a product they\nenjoy, and they’ll be happy to spread the word.\nWHY DO PEOPLE BUZZ ABOUT SOME PRODUCTS MORE THAN OTHERS?\nBzzAgent has run hundreds of campaigns for clients as diverse as Ralph Lauren, the March of Dimes,\nand Holiday Inn Express. Some campaigns were more successful at generating word of mouth than\nothers. Why? Did some products or ideas just get lucky? Or were there some underlying principles\ndriving certain products to get talked about more?\nI offered to help find the answer. Enthusiastic at the prospect, Dave gave my colleague Eric\nSchwartz and me access to data from the hundreds of campaigns he’d run over the years.\nWe started by testing an intuitive idea: interesting products get talked about more than boring ones.\nProducts can be interesting because they’re novel, exciting, or confound expectations in some way. If\ninterest drives talking, then action flicks and Disney World should be talked about more than\nCheerios and dish soap.\nIntuitively this makes sense. As we discussed in the Social Currency chapter, when we talk to\nothers, we’re not only communicating information; we’re also saying something about ourselves.\nWhen we rave about a new foreign film or express disappointment with the Thai restaurant around the\ncorner, we’re demonstrating our cultural and culinary knowledge and taste. Since we want others to\nthink we’re interesting, we search for interesting things to tell them. After all, who’d want to invite\npeople to a cocktail party if all they talked about was dish soap and breakfast cereal?\nBased on this idea, advertisers often try to create surprising or even shocking ads. Dancing\nmonkeys or ravenous wolves chasing a marching band. Guerrilla and viral marketing campaigns are\nbuilt on the same notion: Have people dress in chicken suits and hand out fifty-dollar bills on the\nsubway. Do something really different or people won’t talk.\nBut is this actually true? Do things have to be interesting to be discussed?\nTo find out, we took the hundreds of products that had taken part in BzzCampaigns and asked\npeople how interesting they found each of them. An automatic shower cleaning device? A service that\npreserves newborn babies’ umbilical cords? Both seemed pretty interesting. Mouthwash and trail\nmix? Not so interesting.\nThen we looked at the relationship between a product’s interest score and how frequently it was\ntalked about over the ten-week campaign.\nBut there was none. Interesting products didn’t receive any more word of mouth than boring ones.\nPuzzled, we took a step back. Maybe “interest” was the wrong term, potentially too vague or\ngeneral a concept? So we asked people to score the products on more concrete dimensions, like how\nnovel or surprising they were. An electronic toothbrush was seen as more novel than plastic storage\nbags; dress shoes designed to be as comfortable as sneakers were seen as more surprising than bath\ntowels.\nBut there was still no relationship between novelty or surprise scores and overall word of mouth.\nMore novel or surprising products didn’t get more buzz.\nMaybe it was the people scoring the products. We had first used undergraduate college students, so\nwe recruited a new set of people, of all ages and backgrounds.\nNope. Again the results remained the same. No correlation between levels of interest, novelty, or\nsurprise and the number of times people talked about the products.\nWe were truly bewildered. What were we doing wrong?\nNothing, as it turned out. We just weren’t asking the right questions.\nTHE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN IMMEDIATE AND ONGOING WORD OF MOUTH\nWe had been focused on whether certain aspects matter—specifically, whether more interesting,\nnovel, or surprising products get talked about more. But as we soon realized, we also should have\nbeen examining when they matter.\nSome word of mouth is immediate, while some is ongoing. Imagine you’ve just gotten an e-mail\nabout a new recycling initiative. Do you talk about it with your coworkers later that day? Mention it\nto your spouse that weekend? If so, you’re engaging in immediate word of mouth. This occurs when\nyou pass on the details of an experience, or share new information you’ve acquired, soon after it\noccurs.\nOngoing word of mouth, in contrast, covers the conversations you have in the weeks and months\nthat follow. The movies you saw last month or a vacation you took last year.\nBoth types of word of mouth are valuable, but certain types are more important for certain products\nor ideas. Movies depend on immediate word of mouth. Theaters are looking for success right off the\nbat, so if a film isn’t doing well right away, they’ll replace it with something else. New food products\nare under similar pressure. Grocery stores have limited shelf space. If consumers don’t immediately\nstart buying a new anticholesterol spread, the store may stop stocking it. In such cases, immediate\nword of mouth is critical.\nFor most products or ideas, however, ongoing word of mouth is also important. Antibullying\ncampaigns not only want to get students talking right after the campaign is introduced, they want them\nto keep spreading the word until bullying is eradicated. New policy initiatives certainly benefit from\nhuge discussion when they are proposed, but to sway voter opinion, people need to keep mentioning\nthem all the way up until Election Day.\nBut what leads someone to talk about something soon after it occurs? And are these the same things\nthat drive them to keep talking about it for weeks or months after?\nTo answer these questions, we divided the data on each BzzCampaign into two categories:\nimmediate and ongoing word of mouth. Then we looked at how much of each type of buzz different\ntypes of products generated.\nAs we suspected, interesting products received more immediate word of mouth than boring\nproducts. This reinforces what we talked about in the Social Currency chapter: interesting things are\nentertaining and reflect positively on the person talking about them.\nBut interesting products did not sustain high levels of word-of-mouth activity over time. Interesting\nproducts didn’t get any more ongoing word of mouth than boring ones.\nImagine I walked into work one day dressed as a pirate. A bright red satin bandana, long black\nwaistcoat, gold earrings, and a patch over one eye. It would be pretty remarkable. People in my office\nwould probably gossip about it all day. (“What in the world is Jonah doing? Casual Friday is\nsupposed to be relaxed, but this is taking it too far!”)\nBut while my pirate getup would get lots of immediate word of mouth, people probably wouldn’t\nkeep talking about it every week for the next two months.\nSo if interest doesn’t drive ongoing word of mouth, what does? What keeps people talking?\nFROM MARS BARS TO VOTING: HOW TRIGGERS AFFECT BEHAVIOR\nAt any given moment, some thoughts are more top of mind, or accessible, than others. Right now, for\nexample, you might be thinking about the sentence you are reading or the sandwich you had for lunch.\nSome things are chronically accessible. Sports fanatics or foodies will often have those subjects\ntop of mind. They are constantly thinking of their favorite team’s latest stats, or about ways to\ncombine ingredients in tasty dishes.\nBut stimuli in the surrounding environment can also determine which thoughts and ideas are top of\nmind. If you see a puppy while jogging in the park, you might remember that you’ve always wanted to\nadopt a dog. If you smell Chinese food while walking past the corner noodle shop, you might start\nthinking about what to order for lunch. Or if you hear an advertisement for Coke, you might remember\nthat you ran out of soda last night. Sights, smells, and sounds can trigger related thoughts and ideas,\nmaking them more top of mind. A hot day might trigger thoughts about climate change. Seeing a sandy\nbeach in a travel magazine might trigger thoughts of Corona beer.\nUsing a product is a strong trigger. Most people drink milk more often than grape juice, so milk is\ntop of mind more often. But triggers can also be indirect. Seeing a jar of peanut butter not only\ntriggers us to think about peanut butter, it also makes us think about its frequent partner, jelly. Triggers\nare like little environmental reminders for related concepts and ideas.\n—————\nWhy does it matter if particular thoughts or ideas are top of mind? Because accessible thoughts and\nideas lead to action.\nBack in mid-1997, the candy company Mars noticed an unexpected uptick in sales of its Mars bar.\nThe company was surprised because it hadn’t changed its marketing in any way. It wasn’t spending\nadditional money on advertising, it hadn’t changed its pricing, and it hadn’t run any special\npromotions. Yet sales had gone up. What had happened?\nNASA had happened. Specifically, NASA’s Pathfinder mission.\nThe mission was designed to collect samples of atmosphere, climate, and soil from a nearby\nplanet. The undertaking took years of preparation and millions of dollars in funding. When the lander\nfinally touched down on the alien landscape, the entire world was rapt, and all news outlets featured\nNASA’s triumph.\nPathfinder’s destination? Mars.\nMars bars are named after the company’s founder, Franklin Mars, not the planet. But the media\nattention the planet received acted as a trigger that reminded people of the candy and increased sales.\nPerhaps the makers of Sunny Delight should encourage NASA to explore the sun.\nMusic researchers Adrian North, David Hargreaves, and Jennifer McKendrick examined how\ntriggers might affect supermarket buying behavior more broadly. You know the Muzak you’re used to\nhearing while you shop for groceries? Well, North, Hargreaves, and McKendrick subtly replaced it\nwith music from different countries. Some days they played French music while other days they\nplayed German music—what you’d expect to hear outside a French café on the banks of the Seine and\nwhat you might expect to hear at Oktoberfest. Then they measured the type of wine people purchased.\nWhen French music was playing, most customers bought French wine. When German music was\nplaying most customers bought German wine. By triggering consumers to think of different countries,\nthe music affected sales. The music made ideas related to those countries more accessible, and those\naccessible ideas spilled over to affect behavior.\nPsychologist Gráinne Fitzsimons and I conducted a related study on how to encourage people to eat\nmore fruits and vegetables. Promoting healthy eating habits is tough. Most people realize they should\neat more fruits and vegetables. Most people will even say that they mean to eat more fruits and\nvegetables. But somehow when the time comes to put fruits and vegetables into shopping carts or onto\ndinner plates, people forget. We thought we’d use triggers to help them remember.\nStudents were paid twenty dollars to report what they ate every day for breakfast, lunch, and dinner\nat their nearby dining hall. Monday: a bowl of Frosted Flakes cereal, two helpings of turkey lasagna\nwith a side salad, and a pulled pork sandwich with spinach and fries. Tuesday: yogurt with fruit and\nwalnuts, pepperoni pizza with Sprite, and shrimp pad thai.\nHalfway through the two weeks we’d designated for the study, the students were asked to\nparticipate in what seemed like an unrelated experiment from a different researcher. They were asked\nto provide feedback on a public-health slogan targeting college students. Just to be sure they\nremembered the slogan, they were shown it more than twenty times, printed in different colors and\nfonts.\nOne group of students saw the slogan “Live the healthy way, eat five fruits and veggies a day.”\nAnother group saw “Each and every dining-hall tray needs five fruits and veggies a day.” Both\nslogans encouraged people to eat fruits and vegetables, but the tray slogan did so using a trigger. The\nstudents lived on campus, and many of them ate in dining halls that used trays. So we wanted to see if\nwe could trigger healthy eating behavior by using the dining room tray to remind students of the\nslogan.\nOur students didn’t care for the tray slogan. They called it “corny” and rated it as less than half as\nattractive as the more generic “live healthy” slogan. Further, when asked whether the slogan would\ninfluence their own fruit and vegetable consumption, the students who had been shown the “tray”\nslogan were significantly more likely to say no.\nBut when it came to actual behavior, the effects were striking. Students who had been shown the\nmore generic “live healthy” slogan didn’t change their eating habits. But students who had seen the\n“tray” slogan and used trays in their cafeterias markedly changed their behavior. The trays reminded\nthem of the slogan and they ate 25 percent more fruits and vegetables as a result. The trigger worked.\nWe were pretty excited by the results. Getting college students to do anything—let alone eat more\nfruits and vegetables—is an impressive feat.\nBut when a colleague of ours heard about the study he wondered whether triggers would impact an\neven more consequential behavior: voting.\n—————\nWhere did you cast your ballot in the last election?\nMost people will answer this question with the name of their city or state. Evanston. Birmingham.\nFlorida. Nevada. If asked to clarify, they might add “near my office” or “across from the\nsupermarket.” Few will be more specific. And why should they be? Although geography clearly\nmatters in voting—the East Coast leans Democratic while the South skews Republican—few people\nwould think that the exact venue in which they vote matters.\nBut it does.\nPolitical scientists usually assume that voting is based on rational and stable preferences: people\npossess core beliefs and weigh costs and benefits when deciding how to vote. If we care about the\nenvironment, we vote for candidates who promise to protect natural resources. If we’re concerned\nabout health care, we support initiatives to make it more affordable and available to greater numbers\nof people. In this calculating, cognitive model of voting behavior, the particular kind of building\npeople happen to cast their ballot in shouldn’t affect behavior.\nBut in light of what we were learning about triggers, we weren’t so sure. Most people in the United\nStates are assigned to vote at a particular polling location. They are typically public buildings—\nfirehouses, courthouses, or schools—but can also be churches, private office buildings, or other\nvenues.\nDifferent locations contain different triggers. Churches are filled with religious imagery, which\nmight remind people of church doctrine. Schools are filled with lockers, desks, and chalkboards,\nwhich might remind people of children or early educational experiences. And once these thoughts are\ntriggered, they might change behavior.\nCould voting in a church lead people to think more negatively about abortion or gay marriage?\nCould voting in a school lead people to support education funding?\nTo test this idea, Marc Meredith, Christian Wheeler, and I acquired data from each polling place in\nArizona’s 2000 general election. We used the name and address of each polling location to determine\nwhether it was a church, a school, or some other type of building. Forty percent of people were\nassigned to vote in churches, 26 percent in schools, 10 percent in community centers, and the rest in a\nmix of apartment buildings, golf courses, and even RV parks.\nThen we examined whether people voted differently at different types of polling places. In\nparticular, we focused on a ballot initiative that proposed raising the sales tax from 5.0 percent to 5.6\npercent to support public schools. This initiative had been hotly debated, with good arguments on\nboth sides. Most people support education but few people enjoy paying more taxes. It was a tough\ndecision.\nIf where people voted didn’t matter, then the percent supporting the initiative should be the same at\nschools and other polling locations.\nBut it wasn’t. More than ten thousand more people voted in favor of the school funding initiative\nwhen the polling place was a school. Polling location had a dramatic impact on voting behavior.\nAnd the initiative passed.\nThis difference persisted even after we controlled for things like regional differences in political\npreferences and demographics. We even compared two similar groups of voters to double-check our\nfindings. People who lived near schools and were assigned to vote at one versus people who lived\nnear schools but were assigned to vote at a different type of polling place (such as a firehouse). A\nsignificantly higher percentage of the people who voted in schools were in favor of increasing\nfunding for schools. The fact that they were in a school when they voted triggered more schoolfriendly\nbehavior.\nA ten-thousand-vote difference in a statewide election might not seem like much. But it was more\nthan enough to shift a close election. In the 2000 presidential election the difference between George\nBush and Al Gore came down to less than 1,000 votes. If 1,000 votes is enough to shift an election,\n10,000 certainly could. Triggers matter.\nSo how do triggers help determine whether products and ideas catch on?\nSEARCHING FOR “FRIDAY” ON . . . FRIDAY\nIn 2011, Rebecca Black accomplished a momentous achievement. The thirteen-year-old released\nwhat many music critics dubbed the worst song ever.\nBorn in 1997, Rebecca was just a kid when she released her first full-length song. But this was far\nfrom her first foray into music. She had auditioned for shows, had attended music summer camp, and\nhad sung publicly for a number of years. After hearing from a classmate who had turned to outside\nhelp for her music career, Rebecca’s parents paid four thousand dollars to ARK Music Factory, a Los\nAngeles label, to write a song for their daughter to sing.\nThe result was decidedly, well, awful. Entitled “Friday,” the tune was a whiny, overproduced\nnumber about teenage life and the joys of the weekend. The song starts with her getting up in the\nmorning and getting ready to go to school:\nSeven a.m., waking up in the morning\nGotta be fresh, gotta go downstairs\nGotta have my bowl, gotta have cereal\nThen she hustles down to the bus stop, sees her friends drive by, and ponders whether to sit in the\nfront seat or the back. Finally, after all those tough decisions, she hits the chorus, an ode to her\nexcitement about the impending two days of freedom:\nIt’s Friday, Friday\nGotta get down on Friday\nEverybody’s lookin’ forward to the weekend, weekend.\nAll in all, the piece sounds more like a monologue of the random thoughts going through an\nespecially vacant teenager’s head than a real song.\nYet this song was one of the most viral videos of 2011. It was viewed more than 300 million times\non YouTube, and many millions more listened to it over other channels.\nWhy? The song was terrible, but lots of songs are terrible. So what made this one a success?\nTake a look at the number of daily searches for “Rebecca Black” on YouTube in March 2011, soon\nafter the song was first released. See if you notice a pattern.\nSearches for “Rebecca Black” on YouTube March 2011\nNotice the spike once every week? Look closer and you’ll see that the spike happens on the same\nday every week. There was one on March 18, seven days later on March 25, and seven days later, on\nApril 1.\nThe particular day of the week? You guessed it. Friday—just like the name of Rebecca Black’s\nsong.\nSo while the song was equally bad every day of the week, each Friday it received a strong trigger\nthat contributed to its success.\nTRIGGERED TO TALK\nAs discussed in the Social Currency chapter, some word of mouth is motivated by peoples’ desire to\nlook good to others. Mentioning clever or entertaining things makes people seem clever and\nentertaining. But that isn’t the only factor that drives us to share.\nMost conversations can be described as small talk. We chat with parents at our kids’ soccer games\nor schmooze with coworkers in the break room. These conversations are less about finding interesting\nthings to say to make us look good than they are about filling conversational space. We don’t want to\nsit there silently, so we talk about something. Anything. Our goal isn’t necessarily to prove that we\nare interesting, funny, or intelligent. We just want to say something to keep the conversation going.\nAnything to prove that we’re not terrible conversationalists.\nSo what do we talk about? Whatever is top of mind is a good place to start. If something is\naccessible, it’s usually relevant to the situation at hand. Did you read about the new bridge\nconstruction? What did you think about the game last night?\nWe talk about these topics because they are going on in the surrounding environment. We saw the\nbulldozers on our drive in, so construction is on our mind. We bump into a friend who likes sports, so\nwe think about the big game. Triggers boost word of mouth.\nReturning to the BzzAgent data, triggers helped us answer why some products get talked about\nmore. More frequently triggered products got 15 percent more word of mouth. Even mundane\nproducts like Ziploc bags and moisturizer received lots of buzz because people were triggered to\nthink about them so frequently. People who use moisturizer often apply it at least once a day. People\noften use Ziploc bags after meals to wrap up leftovers. These everyday activities make those products\nmore top of mind and, as a result, lead them to be talked about more.\nFurthermore, not only did triggered products get more immediate word of mouth, they also got\nmore word of mouth on an ongoing basis.\nIn this way, Ziploc bags are the antithesis of me going to teach dressed like a pirate. The pirate\nstory is interesting, but it’s here today, gone tomorrow. Ziploc bags may be boring, but they get\nmentioned week in and week out because they are frequently triggered. By acting as reminders,\ntriggers not only get people talking, they keep them talking. Top of mind means tip of tongue.\n—————\nSo rather than just going for a catchy message, consider the context. Think about whether the\nmessage will be triggered by the everyday environments of the target audience. Going for interesting\nis our default tendency. Whether running for class president or selling soda, we think that catchy or\nclever slogans will get us where we need to go.\nBut as we saw in our fruits and vegetables study, a strong trigger can be much more effective than a\ncatchy slogan. Even though they hated the slogan, college students ate more fruits and vegetables\nwhen cafeteria trays triggered reminders of the health benefits. Just being exposed to a clever slogan\ndidn’t change behavior at all.\nA few years ago, auto insurance company GEICO ran ads that said switching to GEICO was so\nsimple that even a caveman could do it. On the cleverness dimension the ads were great. They were\nfunny and made the point that switching to GEICO was easy.\nBut judged on triggers, the ads fail. We don’t see many cavemen in our daily lives, so the ad is\nunlikely to come to mind often, making it less likely to be talked about.\nContrast that with the Budweiser beer “Wassup?” campaign. Two guys are talking on the phone\nwhile drinking Budweiser and watching a basketball game on television. A third friend arrives. He\nyells, “Wassup?” One of the first two guys yells “Wassup?” back. This kicks off an endless cycle of\nwassups between a growing number of Budweiser-drinking buddies.\nNo, it wasn’t the cleverest of commercials. But it became a global phenomenon. And at least part\nof its success was due to triggers. Budweiser considered the context. “Wassup” was a popular\ngreeting among young men at the time. Just greeting friends triggered thoughts of Budweiser in\nBudweiser’s prime demographic.\nThe more the desired behavior happens after a delay, the more important being triggered becomes.\nMarket research often focuses on consumers’ immediate reaction to an advertising message or\ncampaign. That might be valuable in situations where the consumer is immediately offered a chance to\nbuy the product. But in most cases, people hear an ad one day and then go to the store days or weeks\nlater. If they’re not triggered to think about it, how will they remember that ad when they’re at the\nstore?\nPublic health campaigns would also benefit from considering the context. Take messages that\nencourage college students to drink responsibly. While the messages might be really clever and\nconvincing, they’re posted at the campus health center, far away from the frat houses or other places\nwhere students actually drink. So while students may agree with the message when they read it, unless\nthey are triggered to think about it when they are actually drinking, the message is unlikely to change\nbehavior.\nTriggers even shed light on when negative word of mouth has positive effects. Economist Alan\nSorensen, Scott Rasmussen, and I analyzed hundreds of New York Times book reviews to see how\npositive and negative reviews affected book sales.\nIn contrast to the notion that any publicity is good publicity, negative reviews hurt sales for some\nbooks. But for books by new or relatively unknown authors, negative reviews increased sales by 45\npercent. A book called Fierce People, for example, got a terrible review. The Times noted that the\nauthor “does not have a particularly sharp eye” and complained that “the change in tone is so abrupt\nthat the dissonance it creates is almost distasteful.” Yet sales more than quadrupled after the review.\nTriggers explain why. Even a bad review or negative word of mouth can increase sales if it\ninforms or reminds people that the product or idea exists. That’s why a sixty-dollar Tuscan red wine\nsaw sales rise by 5 percent after a prominent wine website described it as “redolent of stinky socks.”\nIt’s also one reason why the Shake Weight, a vibrating dumbbell that was widely ridiculed by the\nmedia and consumers, went on to do $50 million in sales. Even negative attention can be useful if it\nmakes products and ideas top of mind.\nKIT KAT AND COFFEE: GROWING THE HABITAT\nOne product that used triggers brilliantly is Kit Kat.\n“Give me a break, give me a break, break me off a piece of that Kit Kat bar!” Introduced in the\nUnited States in 1986, the Kit Kat tune is one of the most iconic jingles ever made. Sing the first\ncouple of words to almost anyone over twenty-five and the person can finish the line. Researchers\neven deemed it one of the top ten “earworms”—a melody that gets stuck in your head—of all time.\nEven more memorable than “YMCA” (take that, Village People).\nBut in 2007, Colleen Chorak was tasked with reviving the Kit Kat brand. In the twenty-plus years\nsince the jingle was first introduced, the brand had run out of gas. Hershey produces everything from\nReese’s Pieces and Hershey’s Kisses to Almond Joy, Twizzlers, and Jolly Ranchers. With this huge\nslate of different items, it’s not surprising that a brand can get lost. And that is exactly what had\nhappened with Kit Kat. Hershey had floundered with replacing the “give me a break” campaign.\nSales were declining around 5 percent a year, and the brand had contracted considerably. People still\nloved the product, but consumer interest was way down.\nColleen needed a way to get consumers to start thinking about the brand again. To make Kit Kat\nmore top of mind. And given the years of failed new directions, upper management was unwilling to\nspend the money to put the brand back on TV. Any financial support would be modest at best.\nSo she did some research. Colleen looked at when people actually consumed Kit Kats. She found\ntwo things: consumers often ate Kit Kats to take a break, and many consumed it in coordination with a\nhot beverage.\nShe had an idea.\nKit Kat and coffee.\nColleen pulled the campaign together in a matter of months. Described as “a break’s best friend,”\nthe radio spots featured the candy bar sitting on a counter next to a cup of coffee, or someone grabbing\ncoffee and asking for a Kit Kat. Kit Kat and coffee. Coffee and Kit Kat. The spots repeatedly paired\nthe two together.\nThe campaign was a hit.\nBy the end of the year it had lifted sales by 8 percent. After twelve months, sales were up by a\nthird. Kit Kat and coffee put Kit Kat back on the map. The then-$300 million brand has since grown\nto $500 million.\nMany things contributed to the campaign’s success. “Kit Kat and coffee” has a nice alliteration, and\nthe idea of taking a break to have a Kit Kat fits well with the existing notion of a coffee break. But I’d\nlike to add one more reason to the list.\nTriggers. “Kit Kat and cantaloupe” is equally alliterative, and break dancing would also have\nfitted with the break concept. But coffee is a particularly good thing to link the brand to because it is a\nfrequent stimulus in the environment. A huge number of people drink coffee. Many drink it a number\nof times throughout the day. And so by linking Kit Kat to coffee, Colleen created a frequent trigger to\nremind people of the brand.\n—————\nBiologists often talk about plants and animals as having habitats, natural environments that contain\nall necessary elements for sustaining an organism’s life. Ducks need water and grasses to eat. Deer\nthrive in areas that contain open spaces for grazing.\nProducts and ideas also have habitats, or sets of triggers that cause people to think about them.\nTake hot dogs. Barbecues, summertime, baseball games, and even wiener dogs (dachshunds) are\njust a few of the triggers that make up the habitat for hot dogs.\nCompare that with the habitat for Ethiopian food. What triggers most people to think of Ethiopian\nfood? Ethiopian food is certainly delicious, but its habitat is not as prevalent.\nMost products or ideas have a number of natural triggers. Mars bars and Mars the planet are\nalready naturally connected. The Mars company didn’t need to do anything to create that link.\nLikewise, French music is a natural trigger for French wine, and the last day of the workweek is a\nnatural trigger for Rebecca Black’s song “Friday.”\nBut it’s also possible to grow an idea’s habitat by creating new links to stimuli in the environment.\nKit Kat wouldn’t normally be associated with coffee, but through repeated pairing, Colleen Chorak\nwas able to link the two. Similarly, our trays experiment created a link between dining-room trays\nand a message to eat fruits and vegetables by repeatedly pairing the two ideas together. And by\nincreasing the habitat for the message, these newly formed links helped the desired behavior catch on.\nConsider an experiment we conducted with BzzAgent and Boston Market. This fast-casual\nrestaurant is best known for home-style comfort food (rotisserie chicken and mashed potatoes) and\nwas primarily viewed as a lunch place. Management wanted to generate more buzz. We thought we\ncould help by growing Boston Market’s habitat.\nDuring a six-week campaign, some people were exposed to messages that repeatedly paired the\nrestaurant with dinner. “Thinking about dinner? Think about Boston Market!”. Other people received\na similar advertising campaign that contained a more generic message: “Thinking about a place to\neat? Think about Boston Market!” We then measured how often the respective groups talked about the\nrestaurant.\nThe results were dramatic. Compared to the generic message, the message that grew the habitat (by\nassociating Boston Market with dinner) increased word of mouth by 20 percent among people who\npreviously had associated the brand only with lunch. Growing the habitat boosted buzz.\n—————\nCompetitors can even be used as a trigger.\nHow can public health organizations compete against the marketing strength of better-funded rivals\nlike cigarette companies? One way to combat this inequality is to transform a weakness into a\nstrength: by making a rival’s message act as a trigger for your own.\nA famous antismoking campaign, for example, spoofed Marlboro’s iconic ads by captioning a\npicture of one Marlboro cowboy talking to another with the words: “Bob, I’ve got emphysema.” So\nnow whenever people see a Marlboro ad, it triggers them to think about the antismoking message.\nResearchers call this strategy the poison parasite because it slyly injects “poison” (your message)\ninto a rival’s message by making it a trigger for your own.\nWHAT MAKES FOR AN EFFECTIVE TRIGGER?\nTriggers can help products and ideas catch on, but some stimuli are better triggers than others.\nAs we discussed, one key factor is how frequently the stimulus occurs. Hot chocolate would also\nhave fitted really well with Kit Kat, and the sweet beverage might have even complemented the\nchocolate bar’s flavor better than coffee. But coffee is a more effective trigger because people think\nabout and see it much more frequently. Most people drink hot chocolate only in the winter, while\ncoffee is consumed year-round.\nSimilarly, Michelob ran a successful campaign in the 1970s that linked weekends with the beer\nbrand (“Weekends are made for Michelob”). However, that wasn’t the slogan when the campaign\nstarted out. Originally the slogan was “Holidays are made for Michelob.” But this proved ineffective\nbecause the chosen stimuli—holidays—don’t happen that often. So Anheuser-Busch revised the\nslogan to “Weekends are made for Michelob,” which was much more successful.\nFrequency, however, must also be balanced with the strength of the link. The more things a given\ncue is associated with, the weaker any given association. It’s like poking a hole in the bottom of a\npaper cup filled with water. If you poke just one hole, a strong stream of water will gush out. But\npoke more holes, and the pressure of the stream from each opening lessens. Poke too many holes and\nyou’ll get barely a trickle from each.\nTriggers work the same way. The color red, for example, is associated with many things: roses,\nlove, Coca-Cola, and fast cars, to name just a few. As a result of being ubiquitous, it’s not a\nparticularly strong trigger for any of these ideas. Ask different people to say the word that first comes\nto their mind when they think of red and you’ll see what I mean.\nCompare that with how many people think “jelly” when you say “peanut butter” and it will be clear\nwhy stronger, more unusual links are better. Linking a product or idea with a stimulus that is already\nassociated with many things isn’t as effective as forging a fresher, more original link.\nIt is also important to pick triggers that happen near where the desired behavior is taking place.\nConsider a clever but ultimately ineffective public service ad from New Zealand. A handsome,\nmuscular man is taking a shower. In the background you hear a catchy jingle about HeatFlow, a new\ntemperature-control system that ensures you’ll always have sufficient hot water for long, luxurious\nshowers. The man turns off the water. When he opens the shower door, an attractive woman tosses\nhim a towel. He smiles. She smiles. He begins to step out of the shower stall.\nSuddenly, he slips. Falling, he cracks his head on the tile floor. As he lies there, motionless, his\narm twitches slightly. A voice-over somberly intones: “Preventing slips around your home can be as\neasy as using a bath mat.”\nWow. Definitely surprising. Extremely memorable. So memorable, I think about it every time I take\na shower in a bathroom that doesn’t have a mat on the floor.\nBut there’s only one problem.\nI can’t buy a bath mat in a bathroom. The message is physically removed from the desired\nbehavior. Unless I leave the bathroom, turn on my laptop, and buy a mat online, I have to remember\nthe message until I get to a store.\nContrast that with a New York City Department of Health (DOH) antisoda campaign. While soda\nmight seem like a relatively low-calorie item compared to all the food we eat during the course of a\nday, drinking sugary beverages actually has a big impact on weight gain. But the DOH didn’t just\nwant to tell people how much sugar was in soda, it wanted to make sure people would remember to\nchange their behavior and spread the message to others.\nSo the DOH made a video showing someone opening what seems like a normal soda can. But when\nhe starts to pour it into a glass, out spills fat. Blob after blob of white, chunky fat. The guy picks the\nglass up and knocks the fat back just as one would a regular soda—chunks and all.\nThe “Man Drinks Fat” clip closes with a huge congealed chunk of fat being dropped on a dinner\nplate. It oozes over the table as a message flashes up on the screen: “Drinking one can of soda a day\ncan make you 10 pounds fatter a year. So don’t drink yourself fat.”\nThe video is clever. But by showing fat pouring out of a can, the DOH also nicely leveraged\ntriggers. Unlike the bath mat ad, its video triggered the message (don’t consume sugary drinks) at\nprecisely the right time: when people are thinking of drinking a soda.\nCONSIDER THE CONTEXT\nThese campaigns underscore how important it is to consider the context: to think about the\nenvironments of the people a message or idea is trying to trigger. Different environments contain\ndifferent stimuli. Arizona is surrounded by desert. Floridians see lots of palm trees. Consequently,\ndifferent triggers will be more or less effective depending on where people live.\nSimilarly, the effectiveness of the hundred-dollar cheesesteak that we talked about in the\nintroduction depends on the city where it is introduced.\nA hundred-dollar sandwich is pretty remarkable, wherever you are. But how frequently people\nwill be triggered to think about it depends on geography. In places where people eat lots of\ncheesesteaks (Philadelphia), people would be triggered often, but in other places (such as Chicago)\nnot so much.\nEven within a given city or geographic region, people experience different triggers based on the\ntime of day or year. One study we conducted around Halloween, for example, found that people were\nmuch more likely to think about products associated with the color orange (such as orange soda or\nReese’s Pieces) the day before Halloween than a week later. Before Halloween, all the orange\nstimuli in the environment (pumpkins and orange displays) triggered thoughts of orange products. But\nas soon as the holiday was over, those triggers disappeared, and so did thoughts of orange products.\nPeople moved on to thinking about Christmas or whatever holiday came next.\nSo when thinking about, say, how to remember to take your reusable grocery bags to the grocery\nstore, think about what will trigger you at exactly the right time. Using reusable grocery bags is like\neating more vegetables. We know we should do it. We even want to do it (most of us have bought the\nbags). But when it comes time to take action, we forget.\nThen, right as we pull into the grocery store parking lot, we remember. Argh, I forgot the reusable\ngrocery bags! But by then it’s too late. We’re at the store and the grocery bags are at home in the\ncloset.\nIt’s no accident that we think about reusable bags right when we get to the store. The grocery is a\nstrong trigger for the bags. But unfortunately it is a badly timed one. Just as with the bath mat public\nservice announcement, the idea is coming to mind, but at the wrong time. To solve this problem, we\nneed to be reminded to bring the bags right when we are leaving the house.\nWhat’s a good trigger in this instance? Anything you have to take with you to buy groceries. Your\nshopping list, for example, is a great one. Imagine if every time you saw your shopping list, it made\nyou think of your reusable bags. It would be much harder to leave the bags at home.\nWHY CHEERIOS GETS MORE WORD OF MOUTH THAN DISNEY WORLD\nTo return to the example that started the chapter, triggers help explain why Cheerios get more word of\nmouth than Disney World. True, Disney World is interesting and exciting. To use the language of\nother chapters in the book, it has high Social Currency and evokes lots of Emotion (next chapter). But\nthe problem is that people don’t think about it very frequently. Most people don’t go to Disney World\nunless they have kids. Even those who do go don’t go that often. Once a year if that. And there are few\ntriggers to remind them about the experience after the initial excitement evaporates.\nBut hundreds of thousands of people eat Cheerios for breakfast every day. Still more see the bright\norange boxes every time they push their shopping carts down the supermarket cereal aisle. And these\ntriggers make Cheerios more accessible, increasing the chance that people will talk about the product.\nThe number of times Cheerios and Disney are mentioned on Twitter illustrates this nicely.\nCheerios are mentioned more frequently than Disney World. But examine the data closely and you’ll\nnotice a neat pattern.\nMention of Cheerios on Twitter\nMentions of Cheerios spike every day at approximately the same time. The first references occur at\n5:00 a.m. They peak between 7:30 a.m. and 8:00 a.m. And they diminish around 11:00 a.m. This\nsharp increase and corresponding decline align precisely with the traditional time for breakfast. The\npattern even shifts slightly on weekends when people eat breakfast later. Triggers drive talking.\n—————\nTriggers are the foundation of word of mouth and contagiousness. To use an analogy, think of most\nrock bands. Social Currency is the front man or woman. It’s exciting, fun, and gets lots of attention.\nTriggers could be the drummer or bassist. It’s not as sexy a concept as Social Currency, but it’s an\nimportant workhorse that gets the job done. People may not pay as much attention to it, but it lays the\ngroundwork that drives success. The more something is triggered, the more it will be top of mind, and\nthe more successful it will become.\nSo we need to consider the context. Like Budweiser’s “wassup” or Rebecca Black’s “Friday,” our\nproducts and ideas need to take advantage of existing triggers. We also need to grow the habitat. Like\nColleen Chorak’s Kit Kat and coffee, we need to create new links to prevalent triggers.\nTriggers and cues lead people to talk, choose, and use. Social currency gets people talking, but\nTriggers keep them talking. Top of mind means tip of tongue.\n3. Emotion\nBy October 27, 2008, Denise Grady had been writing about science for The New York Times for\nmore than a decade. With an eye for quirky topics and a deft narrative style, Grady won numerous\njournalism prizes by making esoteric topics accessible to lay readers.\nThat day, one of Grady’s articles rocketed up the newspaper’s Most E-Mailed list. Within hours of\nits publication thousands of people had decided to pass on the article to their friends, relatives, and\ncoworkers. Grady had scored a viral hit.\nThe topic? How fluid and gas dynamic theories were being used in medical research.\nGrady’s article detailed something called schlieren photography, in which “a small, bright light\nsource, precisely placed lenses, a curved mirror, a razor blade that blocks part of the light beam and\nother tools make it possible to see and photograph disturbances in the air.”\nSounds less than riveting, right? Join the club. When we asked people what they thought of this\narticle on a number of different dimensions, the scores were pretty low. Did it have lots of Social\nCurrency? No, they said. Did it contain a lot of practically useful information (something we’ll\ndiscuss in the Practical Value chapter)? No again.\nIn fact, if you’d gone down the checklist of characteristics traditionally believed to be\nprerequisites for viral content, Grady’s article, entitled “The Mysterious Cough, Caught on Film,”\nwould have lacked most of them. Yet Grady’s piece clearly had something special or so many people\nwouldn’t have hit the e-mail button. What was it?\n—————\nGrady’s interest in science started in high school. She was sitting in chemistry class when she read\nabout Robert Millikan’s famous experiment to determine the charge on a single electron. It was a\ncomplicated idea and a complicated experiment. The study involved suspending tiny droplets of oil\nbetween two metal electrodes, then measuring how strong the electric field had to be in order to stop\nthe droplets from falling.\nGrady read it several times. Again and again until she finally understood. But when she did, it was\nlike a flash going off. She got it. It was thrilling. The thinking behind the experiment was so clever,\nand being able to grasp it was enthralling. She was hooked.\nAfter school Grady went to work at Physics Today magazine. Eventually she worked at Discover\nand Time magazine and finally worked her way up to health editor at The New York Times. The goal\nof her articles was always the same: to give people even just a little bit of that excitement that she had\nfelt back in chemistry class decades before. An appreciation for the magic of scientific discovery.\nIn her piece that October, Grady described how an engineering professor used a photographic\ntechnique to capture a visible image of a seemingly invisible phenomenon—a human cough. The\nschlieren technique had been used for years by aeronautics and military specialists to study how\nshock waves form around high-speed aircraft. But the engineering professor had harnessed the\ntechnique in a new way: to study how airborne infections like tuberculosis, SARS, and influenza\nspread.\nIt made sense that most people thought the article wasn’t particularly useful. After all, they weren’t\nscientists studying fluid dynamics. Nor were they engineers trying to visualize complex phenomena.\nAnd while Grady is one of the best science writers out there, it made sense that the general\npopulation would tend to be more interested in articles about sports or fashion. Finally, while coughs\nwould certainly be a nice trigger to remind people of the article, cold and flu season tends to peak\naround February, four months after the article was released.\nEven Grady was bemused. As a journalist, she’s delighted when something she writes goes viral.\nAnd like most journalists, or even casual bloggers, she’d love to understand why some of her pieces\nget widely shared while others don’t.\nBut while she could make some educated guesses, neither she nor anyone else really knew why one\npiece of content gets shared more than another. What made this particular article go viral?\n—————\nAfter years of analysis, I’m happy to report that my colleagues and I have some answers. Grady’s\n2008 article was part of a multi-year study in which we analyzed thousands of New York Times\narticles to better understand why certain pieces of online content are widely shared.\nA clue comes from the picture that accompanied Grady’s piece. Earlier that October, she had been\nscanning an issue of The New England Journal of Medicine when she came across a piece entitled\n“Coughing and Aerosols.” As soon as she saw it she knew the research would be the perfect basis for\nan article in the Times. Some of the piece was pretty technical, with discussions of infectious\naerosols and velocity maps. But above all the jargon was a simple image, an image that made Grady\ndecide to write her article.\nSimply put, it was amazing. The reason people shared Grady’s article was emotion. When we\ncare, we share.\nMOST E-MAILED LISTS AND THE IMPORTANCE OF SHARING\nHumans are social animals. As discussed in the chapter on Social Currency, people love to share\nopinions and information with others. And our tendency to gossip—for good or ill—shapes our\nrelationships with friends and colleagues alike.\nThe Internet has become increasingly engineered to support these natural inclinations. If people\ncome across a blog post about a new bike sharing program or find a video that helps kids solve tough\nalgebra problems, they can easily hit the Share button or copy and paste the link into an e-mail.\nMost major news or entertainment websites take the extra step of documenting what has been\npassed along most frequently. Listing which articles, videos, and other content have been most\nviewed or shared over the past day, week, or month.\nPeople often use these lists as shortcuts. There is way too much content available to sift through it\nall—hundreds of millions of websites and blogs, billions of videos. For news alone, dozens of highly\nreputable outlets continuously produce new articles.\nFew people have time to seek out the best content in this ocean of information. So they start by\nchecking out what others have shared.\nAs a result, most-shared lists have a powerful ability to shape public discourse. If an article about\nfinancial reform happens to make the list, while one about environmental reform barely falls short,\nthat initially small difference in interest can quickly become magnified. As more people see and share\nthe article about financial reform, citizens may become convinced that financial reform deserves more\ngovernmental attention than environmental reform, even if the financial issue is mild and the\nenvironmental issue severe.\nSo why does some content make the Most E-Mailed list while other content does not?\nFor something to go viral, lots of people have to pass along the same piece of content at around the\nsame time. You might have enjoyed Denise Grady’s cough article, and maybe you shared it with a\ncouple of friends. But for the piece to make the Most E-Mailed list, a large number of people had to\nmake the same decision you did.\nIs this just random? Or might there be some consistent patterns underlying viral success?\nSYSTEMATICALLY ANALYZING THE MOST E-MAILED LIST\nThe life of a Stanford graduate student is far from grand. My office, if you could call it that, was a\nhigh-walled cubicle. It was tucked up in a windowless attic of a 1960s-era building whose\narchitectural style has often been described as “brutalist.” A short, squat structure with concrete\nwalls so thick they could probably withstand a direct hit from a small grenade launcher. Sixty of us\nwere clustered together in a cramped space, and my own ten-by-ten fluorescent-lit box was shared\nwith another student.\nThe one upside was the elevator. Graduate students were expected to be working at all times of\nday and night, so the school gave us a keycard that allowed twenty-four-hour access to a special lift.\nNot only did it take us up to our windowless workstations, it also gave us access to the library, even\nafter it closed. Not the most lavish perk, but a useful one.\nBack then the distribution of online content was not as sophisticated as it is today. Content\nwebsites now post their most e-mailed lists online, but some newspapers published these lists in their\nprint editions as well. Every day The Wall Street Journal published a list of the five most read\narticles and the five most e-mailed articles from the previous day’s news. After scanning a couple of\nthese lists, I was enthralled. It seemed like the perfect data source to study why some things get\nshared more than others.\nSo just as a stamp collector collects stamps, I began to collect the Journal’s Most Emailed list.\nOnce every couple of days I would use the special elevator to go hunting. I would take my trusty\nscissors down to the library late at night, find a stack of the most recent print editions of the Journal,\nand carefully clip out the Most Emailed lists.\nAfter a few weeks, my collection had grown. I had a big stack of news clippings and was ready to\ngo. I entered the lists in a spreadsheet and began looking for patterns. One day “Dealing with the\nDead Zone: Spouses Too Tired to Talk” and “Disney Gowns Are for Big Girls” were two of the most\ne-mailed articles. A few days later “Is an Economist Qualified to Solve Puzzle of Autism?” and\n“Why Birdwatchers Now Carry iPods and Laser Pointers” made the list.\n—————\nHmm. On the face of it, these articles had few characteristics in common. What did tired spouses\nhave to do with Disney gowns? And what did Disney have to do with economists studying autism?\nThe connections were not going to be obvious.\nFurther, reading one or two articles at a time wasn’t going to cut it. To get a handle on things I\nneeded to work faster and more efficiently.\nLuckily my colleague Katherine Milkman suggested a vastly improved method. Rather than pull this\ninformation from the print newspaper by hand, why not automate the process?\nWith the help of a computer programmer, we created a Web crawler. Like a never tiring reader, the\nprogram automatically scanned The New York Times home page every fifteen minutes, recording what\nit saw. Not only the text and title of each article, but also who wrote it and where it was featured\n(posted on the main screen or hidden in a trail of links). It also recorded in which section of the\nphysical paper (health or business, for example) and on what page the article appeared (such as the\nfront page or the back of the third section).\nAfter six months we had a huge data set—every article published by The New York Times over that\nperiod. Almost seven thousand articles. Everything from world news and sports to health and\ntechnology, as well as which articles made the Most E-Mailed list for those same six months.\nNot just what one person shared, but a measure of what all readers, regardless of their age, wealth,\nor other demographics, were sharing with others.\nNow our analysis could begin.\n—————\nFirst, we looked at the general topic of each article. Things like health, sports, education, or\npolitics.\nThe results showed that education articles were more likely to make the Most E-Mailed list than\nsports articles. Health pieces were more viral than political ones.\nNice. But we were more interested in understanding what drives sharing than in simply describing\nthe attributes of content that was shared. Okay, so sports articles are less viral than dining articles.\nBut why? It’s like saying people like to share pictures of cats or talk about paintball more than Ping-\nPong. That doesn’t really tell us much about why that is happening or allow us to make predictions\nbeyond the narrow domains of cat stuff or sports that start with the letter P.\nTwo reasons people might share things are that they are interesting and that they are useful. As we\ndiscussed in the Social Currency chapter, interesting things are entertaining and reflect positively on\nthe person who shares them. Similarly, as we’ll discuss in the Practical Value chapter, sharing useful\ninformation helps others and makes the sharer look good in the process.\nTo test these theories, we hired a small army of research assistants to score New York Times\narticles on whether they contained useful information and how interesting they were. Articles about\nthings like how Google uses search data to track the spread of the flu were scored as highly\ninteresting, while an article about the change in the cast of a Broadway play was scored as less\ninteresting. Articles about how to control your credit score were scored as being very useful, while\nthe obituary of an obscure opera singer was scored as not useful. We fed these scores into a statistical\nanalysis program that compared them with the Most E-Mailed lists.\nAs we expected, both characteristics influenced sharing. More interesting articles were 25 percent\nmore likely to make the Most E-Mailed list. More useful articles were 30 percent more likely to make\nthe list.\nThese results helped explain why health and education articles were highly shared. Articles about\nthese topics are often quite useful. Advice on how to live longer and be happier. Tips for getting the\nbest education for your kids.\nBut there was still one topic that stood out like a sore thumb: science articles. For the most part,\nthese articles did not have as much Social Currency or Practical Value as articles from more\nmainstream sections. Yet science articles, like Denise Grady’s piece about the cough, made the Most\nE-Mailed list more than politics, fashion, or business news. Why?\nIt turns out that science articles frequently chronicle innovations and discoveries that evoke a\nparticular emotion in readers. That emotion? Awe.\nTHE POWER OF AWE\nImagine standing on the very edge of the Grand Canyon. The bloodred gorge stretches as far as you\ncan see in every direction. The canyon floor drops precipitously below your feet. You feel dizzy and\nstep back from the edge. Hawks circle through rock crevasses so barren and stripped of vegetation\nyou could as well be on the moon. You are amazed. You are humbled. You feel elevated. This is awe.\nAccording to psychologists Dacher Keltner and Jonathan Haidt, awe is the sense of wonder and\namazement that occurs when someone is inspired by great knowledge, beauty, sublimity, or might. It’s\nthe experience of confronting something greater than yourself. Awe expands one’s frame of reference\nand drives self-transcendence. It encompasses admiration and inspiration and can be evoked by\neverything from great works of art or music to religious transformations, from breathtaking natural\nlandscapes to human feats of daring and discovery.\nAwe is a complex emotion and frequently involves a sense of surprise, unexpectedness, or mystery.\nIndeed, as Albert Einstein himself noted, “The most beautiful emotion we can experience is the\nmysterious. It is the power of all true art and science. He to whom this emotion is a stranger, who can\nno longer pause to wonder and stand rapt in awe, is as good as dead.”\nMore than any other emotion, awe described what many readers felt after looking at science pieces\nfrom The New York Times. Take “The Mysterious Cough, Caught on Film.” The photo of the cough\nwas stunning both as a visual spectacle and as an idea: that something as mundane as a cough could\nproduce this image and yield secrets capable of solving centuries-old medical mysteries.\nWe decided to test whether awe drove people to share. Our research assistants went back and\nscored the articles based on how much awe they evoked. Articles about a new treatment for AIDS or\na hockey goalie who plays even though he has brain cancer evoked lots of awe. Articles about\nholiday shopping bargains evoked little or no awe. We then used statistical analyses to compare these\nscores with whether articles were highly shared.\nOur intuition was right: awe boosted sharing.\nAwe-inspiring articles were 30 percent more likely to make the Most E-Mailed list. Articles\npreviously judged to have low Social Currency and Practical Value—Grady’s cough piece or an\narticle suggesting that gorillas may, like humans, grieve when losing loved ones—nevertheless made\nthe Most E-Mailed list because of the awe they inspired.\n—————\nSome of the Web’s most viral videos also evoke awe.\nThe snickering started as soon as the plump, matronly woman walked onto the stage. She looked\nmore like a lunch lady than a vocalist. First, she was too old to be competing on Britain’s Got\nTalent. At forty-seven, she was more than twice the age of many of the other contestants.\nBut, more important, she looked, well, frumpy. The other competitors were already dressed to be\nthe next big thing. Sexy, ruggedly handsome, or hip. They wore form-fitting dresses, tailored vests,\nand summer scarves. But this woman looked more like an example of what not to wear. Her outfit\nlooked like a cross between an old set of drapes and a secondhand Easter dress.\nAnd she was nervous. When the judges started asking her questions she got stuck and stumbled on\nher words. “What’s the dream?” they inquired. When she replied that she wanted to be a professional\nsinger you could just see the thoughts going through their heads. That’s rich! You? A professional\nsinger? The cameras zoomed in on members of the audience laughing and rolling their eyes. Even the\njudges smirked. They clearly wanted her to get off the stage as soon as possible. All signs pointed to\nher giving a terrible performance and being booted from the show, pronto.\nBut just as it seemed that it couldn’t get any worse, she started singing.\nAnd time stopped.\nIt was breathtaking.\nAs the opening chords from “I Dreamed a Dream” from Les Misérables wafted over the speakers,\nSusan Boyle’s exquisite voice shone through like a beacon. So powerful, so beautiful that it makes the\nhair on the back of your neck stand up. The judges were awed, the audience screamed, and everyone\nbroke out into wild applause. Some started tearing up as they listened. The performance left people\nspeechless.\nSusan Boyle’s first appearance on Britain’s Got Talent is one of the most viral videos ever. In just\nnine short days, the clip accumulated more than 100 million views.\nIt’s hard to watch this video and not be awed by her strength and heart. It’s not only moving, it’s\nawe-inspiring. And that emotion drove people to pass it on.\nDOES ANY EMOTION BOOST SHARING?\nOur initial New York Times findings brought up other questions. What about awe makes people share?\nMight other emotions have the same effect?\nThere are reasons to believe that experiencing any sort of emotion might encourage people to\nshare. Talking to others often makes emotional experiences better. If we get promoted, telling others\nhelps us celebrate. If we get fired, telling others helps us vent.\nSharing emotions also helps us connect. Say I watch a really awe-inspiring video, like Susan\nBoyle’s performance. If I share that video with a friend, he’s likely to feel similarly inspired. And the\nfact that we both feel the same way helps deepen our social connection. It highlights our similarities\nand reminds us how much we have in common. Emotion sharing is thus a bit like social glue,\nmaintaining and strengthening relationships. Even if we’re not in the same place, the fact that we both\nfeel the same way bonds us together.\nBut these benefits of sharing emotion don’t just arise from awe alone. They happen for all sorts of\nemotions.\nIf you send a coworker a joke that cracks both of you up, it underscores your connection. If you\nsend your cousin an op-ed piece that makes you both angry, it strengthens the fact that you share the\nsame views.\nSo would any type of emotional content be more likely to be shared?\nTo answer this, we picked another emotion, sadness, and dove back into the data. We asked our\nresearch assistants to score each article based on how much sadness it evoked. Articles about things\nlike someone paying tribute to his deceased grandmother were scored as evoking a good deal of\nsadness, while articles about things like a winning golfer were scored as low sadness. If any emotion\nboosted sharing, then sadness—like awe—should also increase sharing.\nBut it didn’t. In fact, sadness had the opposite effect. Sadder articles were actually 16 percent less\nlikely to make the Most E-Mailed list. Something about sadness was making people less likely to\nshare. What?\n—————\nThe most obvious difference between different emotions is their pleasantness or positivity. Awe is\nrelatively pleasant, while sadness is unpleasant. Might positive emotions increase sharing, but\nnegative emotions decrease it?\nPeople have long speculated about how positive and negative emotions influence what people talk\nabout and share. Conventional wisdom suggests that negative content should be more viral. Consider\nthe old news adage “If it bleeds, it leads.” This phrase is based on the notion that bad news generates\nmore attention and interest than good news. That’s why the nightly news always starts with something\nlike: “The hidden health hazard that’s lurking in your basement. Find out more, next, on the six\no’clock news.” Editors and producers believe that negative stories will help draw, and keep,\nviewers’ attention.\nThat said, you could also make a case for the opposite: that people prefer sharing good news. After\nall, don’t most of us want to make others feel happy or positive rather than anxious or sad? Similarly,\nas we discussed in the chapter on Social Currency, whether people share something often depends on\nhow it makes them look to others. Positive things may be shared more because they reflect positively\non the person doing the sharing. After all, no one wants to be Debbie Downer, always sharing things\nthat are sad and gloomy.\nSo which is it? Is positive information more likely to be shared than negative, or vice versa?\nWe went back to our database and measured the positivity of each article. This time we used a\ntextual analysis program developed by psychologist Jamie Pennebaker. The program quantifies the\namount of positivity and negativity in a passage of text by counting the number of times hundreds of\ndifferent emotional words appear. The sentence “I loved the card; that was so nice of her,” for\nexample, is relatively positive because it contains positive words like “love” and “nice.” The\nsentence “That was so nasty of her; it really hurt my feelings,” on the other hand, is relatively negative\nbecause of negative words like “hurt” and “nasty.” We scored each article based on its positivity or\nnegativity and then examined how that related to whether it made the Most E-Mailed list.\nThe answer was definitive: positive articles were more likely to be highly shared than negative\nones. Stories about things like newcomers falling in love with New York City were, on average, 13\npercent more likely to make the Most E-Mailed list than pieces that detailed things like the death of a\npopular zookeeper.\n—————\nFinally we were feeling confident that we understood how emotion shapes transmission. It seemed\nlike people share positive things and avoid sharing negative ones.\nBut just to be sure that we were correct that negative emotions decrease sharing, we gave our\nresearch assistants one final task. We asked them to score each article on two other major negative\nemotions: anger and anxiety.\nArticles about things like Wall Street fat cats getting hefty bonuses during the economic downturn\ninduced lots of anger, while articles about topics like summer T-shirts evoked no anger at all.\nArticles about things like the stock market tanking made people pretty anxious, while articles about\nthings like Emmy Award nominees evoked no anxiety. If it were true that people share positive\ncontent and avoid sharing negative content, then anger and anxiety should, like sadness, reduce\nsharing.\nBut this wasn’t the case. In fact, it was the opposite. Articles that evoked anger or anxiety were\nmore likely to make the Most E-Mailed list.\nNow we were really confused. Clearly, something more complicated than whether an article was\npositive or negative determined how widely things were shared. But what?\nKINDLING THE FIRE: THE SCIENCE OF PHYSIOLOGICAL AROUSAL\nThe idea that emotions can be categorized as positive or pleasant and negative or unpleasant has been\naround for hundreds if not thousands of years. Even a child can tell you that happiness or excitement\nfeels good and anxiety or sadness feels bad.\nMore recently, however, psychologists have argued that emotions can also be classified based on a\nsecond dimension. That of activation, or physiological arousal.\nWhat is physiological arousal? Think about the last time you gave a speech in front of a large\naudience. Or when your team was on the verge of winning a huge game. Your pulse raced, your palms\nsweated, and you could feel your heart pounding in your chest. You may have had similar feelings the\nlast time you saw a scary movie or went camping and heard a weird noise outside your tent. Though\nyour head kept saying you weren’t really in danger, your body was convinced otherwise. Every sense\nwas heightened. Your muscles were tensed and you were alert to every sound, smell, and movement.\nThis is arousal.\nArousal is a state of activation and readiness for action. The heart beats faster and blood pressure\nrises. Evolutionarily, it comes from our ancestors’ reptilian brains. Physiological arousal motivates a\nfight-or-flight response that helps organisms catch food or flee from predators.\nWe no longer have to chase our dinner or worry about being eaten, but the activation arousal\nprovides still facilitates a host of everyday actions. When aroused we do things. We wring our hands\nand pace back and forth. We pump our fists in the air and run around the living room. Arousal kindles\nthe fire.\nSome emotions, like anger and anxiety, are high-arousal. When we’re angry we yell at customer\nservice representatives. When we’re anxious we check and recheck things. Positive emotions also\ngenerate arousal. Take excitement. When we feel excited we want to do something rather than sit still.\nThe same is true for awe. When inspired by awe we can’t help wanting to tell people what happened.\nOther emotions, however, have the opposite effect: they stifle action.\nTake sadness. Whether dealing with a tough breakup or the death of a beloved pet, sad people tend\nto power down. They put on some cozy clothes, curl up on the couch, and eat a bowl of ice cream.\nContentment also deactivates. When people are content, they relax. Their heart rates slow, and their\nblood pressure decreases. They’re happy, but they don’t particularly feel like doing anything. Think\nof how you feel after a long hot shower or a relaxing massage. You’re more likely to relax and sit\nstill than leap into another activity.\nHIGH AROUSAL\nLOW AROUSAL\nPOSITIVE\nAwe\nExcitement\nAmusement (Humor)\nContentment\nNEGATIVE\nAnger\nAnxiety\nSadness\nOnce we realized the important role that emotional arousal might play, we returned to our data. Just\nto recap, so far we had found that awe increased sharing and that sadness decreased it. But rather than\nfinding a simple matter of positive emotions increasing sharing and negative emotions decreasing it,\nwe found that some negative emotions, like anger or anxiety, actually increased sharing. Would\nphysiological arousal be the key to the puzzle?\nIt was.\nUnderstanding arousal helps integrate the different results we had found so far. Anger and anxiety\nlead people to share because, like awe, they are high-arousal emotions. They kindle the fire, activate\npeople, and drive them to take action.\nArousal is also one reason funny things get shared. Videos about the aftereffects of a kid having\nanesthesia at the dentist (“David After Dentist”), a baby biting his brother’s finger (“Charlie Bit My\nFinger—Again!”), or a unicorn going to Candy Mountain and getting his kidney stolen (“Charlie the\nUnicorn”) are some of the most popular on YouTube. Taken together they have been viewed more\nthan 600 million times.\nBut while it is tempting to say that these things went viral simply because they are funny, a more\nfundamental process is at work. Think about the last time you heard a really hilarious joke or were\nforwarded a humorous clip and felt compelled to pass it along. Just like inspiring things, or those that\nmake us angry, funny content is shared because amusement is a high-arousal emotion.\nLow-arousal emotions, however, like sadness, decrease sharing. Contentment has the same effect.\nContentment isn’t a bad feeling. Being content feels pretty good. But people are less likely to talk\nabout or share things that make them content because contentment decreases arousal.\n—————\nUnited Airlines learned the hard way that arousal can drive people to share. Dave Carroll was a\npretty good musician. His group, Sons of Maxwell, wasn’t a blockbuster act, but they made enough\nmoney from album sales, touring, and merchandising to pull together a decent living. People weren’t\ntattooing Dave’s name on their arms, but he was doing all right.\nWhile traveling to a gig in Nebraska, Dave and his band had to take a connecting flight through\nChicago with United Airlines. It’s hard enough to find overhead space for even a small carry-on, but\nmusicians have it even tougher. Dave’s group couldn’t fit their guitars in the overhead, so they had to\ncheck them with the rest of their baggage.\nBut as they were about to deplane at O’Hare Airport, a woman cried out, “My god, they’re\nthrowing guitars out there!” Dave looked out the window in horror just in time to see the baggage\nhandlers roughly tossing his treasured instruments through the air.\nHe jumped up and pleaded with the flight attendant for help, but to no avail. One flight attendant\ntold him to talk to the lead agent, but that agent said it wasn’t her responsibility. Another employee\ngave him the run-around and told him to take up the matter with the gate agent when he landed in his\nfinal destination.\nWhen Dave landed in Omaha at 12:30 a.m., he found the airport deserted. No employees in sight.\nDave made his way to baggage claim and carefully opened his guitar case. His worst fears were\nconfirmed. His $3,500 guitar had been smashed.\nBut that was only the start of Dave’s story. He spent the next nine months negotiating with United\nfor some kind of compensation. He filed a claim asking United to fix the guitar, but it denied his\nrequest. Among a long list of justifications, United argued that it couldn’t help him because he had\nmissed the brief twenty-four-hour window for claiming damages described in the small print of his\nticket.\nFurious with the way he’d been treated, Dave channeled his emotions the way any good musician\nwould: he wrote a song about it. He described his experience, put it to music, and posted it as a short\nclip on YouTube entitled “United Breaks Guitars.”\nWithin twenty-four hours of uploading the video, he’d received almost 500 comments, most of them\nfrom other angry United customers who’d had similar experiences. In less than four days the video\nhad more than 1.3 million views. Within ten days, more than 3 million views and 14,000 comments.\nIn December 2009, Time magazine listed “United Breaks Guitars” as one of the Top 10 Viral Videos\nof 2009.\nUnited appears to have felt the negative effects almost immediately. Within four days of the video\nbeing posted, its stock price fell 10 percent—the equivalent of $180 million. Although United\neventually donated $3,000 to the Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz as a “gesture of goodwill,” many\nindustry observers felt that it suffered permanent damage as a result of the incident.\nFOCUS ON FEELINGS\nMarketing messages tend to focus on information. Public health officials note how much healthier\nteens will be if they don’t smoke or if they eat more vegetables. People think that if they just lay out\nthe facts in a clear and concise way, it will tip the scales. Their audience will pay attention, weigh\nthe information, and act accordingly.\nBut many times information is not enough. Most teens don’t smoke because they think it’s good for\nthem. And most people who scarf down a Big Mac and large fries and wash it down with a\nsupersized Coke are not oblivious to the health risks. So additional information probably won’t get\nthem to change their behavior. They need something more.\nAnd that is where emotion comes in. Rather than harping on features or facts, we need to focus on\nfeelings; the underlying emotions that motivate people to action.\nSome products or ideas may seem better suited than others for evoking emotion. It seems easier to\nget people excited about a new, hip lounge than logistics management. Pets and babies seem to lend\nthemselves to emotional appeals more than banking or nonprofit financial strategy does.\nBut any product or service can focus on feelings, even those that don’t possess any obvious\nemotional hook.\nTake online search engines. Search engines seem like one of the least emotional products you can\nthink of. People want the most accurate search results in the least time possible. And underneath those\nresults is a tangle of confusing technology: link weighting, indexing, and PageRank algorithms. A\ndifficult product to get people fired up or teary eyed about, right?\nWell, Google did exactly that with its “Parisian Love” campaign.\n—————\nWhen Anthony Cafaro graduated from New York’s School of Visual Arts in 2009, he wasn’t\nexpecting to become a Googler. No one from Visual Arts had gone to work for Google before, and the\ncompany was known as a place for techies, not designers. But when Cafaro learned Google was\ninterviewing graphic-design graduates, he thought he’d give it a shot.\nThe interview was a blast. By the end, the interviewers seemed less like examiners and more like\nold friends. Cafaro turned down a slew of offers from traditional ad agencies to join a newly formed\nGoogle design team called the Creative Lab.\nAfter a few months, though, Anthony realized that the Creative Lab’s approach wasn’t exactly in\nline with the company’s overall ethos. Great graphic design is visceral. Like art, it moves people and\nevokes their innermost feelings. But Google was about analytics, not emotion.\nIn a telling story, a designer once suggested using a certain shade of blue for the toolbar based on\nits visual appeal. But the product manager resisted using the color, asking the designer to justify that\nchoice with quantitative research. At Google, colors aren’t just colors, they’re mathematical\ndecisions.\nThe same issues came up in one of Cafaro’s first projects. The Creative Lab was asked to create\ncontent to highlight the functionality of Google’s new search interface. Features like finding flights,\nautocorrect, and language translation. One potential solution was a little tutorial on how to search\nbetter. A how-to of the different functions. Another was “A Google a Day,” an online trivia game that\ninvolved using search features to solve complex puzzles.\nCafaro liked both ideas but felt something was missing. Emotion.\nGoogle had a great interface and useful search results, but an interface doesn’t make you laugh. An\ninterface doesn’t make you cry. A demo would show how the interface worked, but that would be it.\nCafaro wanted to humanize the interface. He wanted not only to show features, but to move people.\nBuild an emotional connection.\nSo together with the Creative Lab team, Cafaro developed a video entitled “Parisian Love.” The\nclip tells a budding love story, using Google searches that evolve over time. No images of people, or\neven voices—just the phrases entered in the search bar and the results that emerge.\nIt starts when a guy enters “study abroad Paris France” and clicks on one of the top search results\nto learn more. Later he searches for “cafés near the Louvre,” and scans to find one he thinks he’ll like.\nYou hear a female laugh in the background as his next entry is “translate tu es très mignon,” which he\nsoon learns is French for “you are very cute.” Quickly he then seeks advice on how to “impress a\nFrench girl,” reads up on the suggestions, and searches for chocolate shops in Paris.\nThe music builds as the plot unfolds. We follow the searcher as he transitions from seeking longdistance\nrelationship advice to job hunting in Paris. We see him tracking a plane’s landing time and\nthen searching for Paris churches (to the accompaniment of church bells in the background). Finally,\nas the music crescendos, we see him asking how to assemble a crib. The video ends with a simple\nmessage. “Search on.”\nYou cannot watch this clip without having your heartstrings tugged. It’s romantic, joyous, and\ninspiring all at once. I still feel tingles every time I see it, and I’ve watched it dozens of times.\nWhen the Creative Lab presented the clip to the Google Search marketing team, everyone loved it.\nGoogle’s CEO’s wife loved it. Everyone wanted to pass it on. In fact, the clip did so well internally\nthat Google decided to release it to the larger public. By focusing on feelings, Google turned a normal\nad into a viral hit.\n—————\nIt doesn’t require a costly ad agency or millions of dollars in focus groups to get people to feel\nemotion. Cafaro created the clip with four other students who had been brought in from design\nprograms across the country. Rather than simply highlighting the latest gee-whiz feature, Cafaro’s\nteam reminded people what they love about Google Search. As one Creative Lab team member put it,\n“The best results don’t show up in a search engine, they show up in people’s lives.” Well said.\nIn their wonderful book Made to Stick, Chip and Dan Heath talk about using the “Three Whys” to\nfind the emotional core of an idea. Write down why you think people are doing something. Then ask\n“Why is this important?” three times. Each time you do this, note your answer, and you’ll notice that\nyou drill down further and further toward uncovering not only the core of an idea, but the emotion\nbehind it.\nTake online search. Why is search important? Because people want to find information quickly.\nWhy do they want to do that? So they can get answers to what they are looking for.\nWhy do they want those answers? So they can connect with people, achieve their goals, and fulfill\ntheir dreams. Now that’s starting to get more emotional.\nWant people to talk about global warming and rally to change it? Don’t just point out how big the\nproblem is or list key statistics. Figure out how to make them care. Talk about polar bears dying or\nhow their children’s health will be affected.\nKINDLING THE FIRE WITH HIGH-AROUSAL EMOTIONS\nWhen trying to use emotions to drive sharing, remember to pick ones that kindle the fire: select higharousal\nemotions that drive people to action.\nOn the positive side, excite people or inspire them by showing them how they can make a\ndifference. On the negative side, make people mad, not sad. Make sure the polar bear story gets them\nfired up.\nSimply adding more arousal to a story or ad can have a big impact on people’s willingness to share\nit. In one experiment we changed the details of a story to make it evoke more anger. In another\nexperiment, we made an ad funnier.\nIn both cases, the results were the same. More anger or more humor led to more sharing. Adding\nthese emotions boosted transmission by boosting the amount of arousal the story or ad evoked.\nNegative emotions can also drive people to talk and share. Marketing messages usually try to paint\nproducts and ideas in the most positive light possible. From razors to refrigerators, ads typically\nshow smiling customers who extol the benefits they derive from using the product. Marketers tend to\navoid negative emotions out of fear they could taint the brand.\nBut if used correctly, negative emotions can actually boost word of mouth.\nBMW kindled the fire beautifully in a 2001 campaign. The German automobile company created a\nseries of short Internet films entitled The Hire. Rather than being typical feel-good commercials\nshowing BMWs driving down various idyllic country roads, the movies were riddled with\nkidnappings, FBI raids, and near-death experiences. While the fear and anxiety they evoked were far\nfrom positive, the clips so highly aroused viewers that the series racked up more than 11 million\nviews within four months. Over the same period, BMW sales increased 12 percent.\nOr consider public health messages. It’s often hard to put a positive spin on things when you’re\ntrying to get people to realize that smoking causes lung cancer, or that obesity reduces life expectancy\nby more than three years. But certain types of negative emotional appeals should be more effective in\ngetting people to spread the word than others.\nThink back to the “Man Drinks Fat” public service announcement we talked about in the Triggers\nchapter. A huge glob of white fat plopping down on a plate? Gross! But because disgust is a highly\narousing emotion, it encouraged people to talk about and share the PSA. Designing messages that\nmake people anxious or disgusted (high arousal) rather than sad (low arousal) will boost\ntransmission. Negative emotions, when used correctly, can be a powerful driver of discussion.\nAnd that brings us to babywearing.\nBABYWEARING, BOYCOTTS, AND BLUNTING BAD BUZZ\nThe year 2008 had many firsts. The first time China hosted the Olympics, the first African American\nelected president of the United States, and one that you might not have been aware of. The inaugural\ncelebration of International Babywearing Week.\nThe practice of carrying your baby in a sling or similar carrier has been around for thousands of\nyears. Some experts have even argued that the practice strengthens the maternal bond, improving the\nhealth of the baby and the mother. But as strollers and other gadgets have been popularized, many\nparents have moved away from this practice. So in 2008, a celebration was held to raise awareness\nand encourage people around the world to reconsider the benefits of babywearing.\nMcNeil Consumer Healthcare, the maker of painkiller Motrin, saw this swell of interest as a\nperfect opportunity. Motrin’s motto at the time was “We feel your pain.” So in an attempt to show\nsolidarity with mothers, the company created an ad centered on the aches and pains mothers can suffer\nfrom carrying their babies in slings. The ad noted that while babywearing can be great for the baby, it\ncan put a ton of strain on the back, neck, and shoulders of the mom.\nThe company was trying to be supportive. It wanted to show that it understood mom’s pain and\nMotrin was there to help. But a number of so-called mommy bloggers saw things differently. The\nmom’s voice-over in the ad said babywearing “totally makes me look like an official mom. And so if\nI look tired and crazy, people will understand why.”\nDeeply offended on two fronts—by the implication that they wore their babies as fashion\nstatements and that they looked crazy—mothers took to their blogs and Twitter accounts. The anger\nspread.\nSoon thousands of people were involved. “A baby will never be a fashion statement. How\noutrageous is that thinking!” one cried. The posts multiplied. Many of the writers said they would\nboycott the company. The topic started to trend on Twitter, and the movement got picked up by The\nNew York Times, Ad Age , and a host of other media outlets. Soon seven out of the top ten searches for\n“Motrin” and “headache” on Google referred to the marketing debacle.\nFinally, after too long a delay, Motrin took the advertisement down from its website and issued a\nlengthy apology.\n—————\nTechnology has made it easier for people to organize behind a common interest or goal. By\nallowing people to connect quickly and easily, social media enable like-minded individuals to find\none another, share information, and coordinate plans of action.\nThese technologies are particularly useful when people either live far apart or are dealing with an\nissue that has delicate political or social meaning. Many people point to social media as the catalyst\nbehind the Arab Spring, the wave of antigovernment protests that broke out across the Arab world,\neventually toppling the governments of Tunisia and Egypt, among others.\nSome of these burgeoning social movements are positive. Enabling citizens to rise up against\ndictatorships or helping teens facing harassment to realize that life gets better.\nBut in other cases the comments and movements are negative in nature. False rumors may start to\ngain traction. Vicious gossip may circulate and build. Is it possible to predict which flare-ups will\nremain isolated comments and which will snowball?\nPart of the answer comes back to physiological arousal. Certain types of negativity may be more\nlikely to escalate because they evoke arousal and are thus more likely to go viral. Angry tirades about\nbad customer service, or anxious rumors about how a new health plan may take away benefits, should\nbe more likely to circulate than expressions of sadness or disappointment.\nSo teachers and principals should be particularly wary of hurtful rumors that carry an arousing\npunch because they are more likely to get passed around. Similarly, Motrin’s maker could have\nstemmed the boycott before it started by monitoring online chatter. By looking for words like “pissed\noff,” “angry,” or “mad” in people’s posts, tweets, or status updates the company could have\naddressed unsatisfied customers before the anger built. Fixing these high-arousal emotions early can\nmitigate the negativity before it snowballs.\nEXERCISE MAKES PEOPLE SHARE\nOur emotional odyssey has one last stop.\nAt Wharton, we have a behavioral lab where people are paid to do various psychology and\nmarketing experiments. These tasks often involve clicking boxes in an online survey or circling items\non a sheet of paper.\nBut when people came in for an experiment of mine one November a few years ago, the\ninstructions were a bit more unusual.\nHalf the participants were asked to sit still in their chairs for sixty seconds and relax. Easy enough.\nThe other half, however, were asked to jog lightly in place for a minute. Regardless of whether\nthey were wearing sneakers or pumps, jeans or slacks, they were asked to run in place for sixty\nseconds in the middle of the laboratory.\nOkay. Sure. I guess. Some participants gave us a puzzled look when we made the request, but all\ncomplied.\nAfter they were done, they participated in what seemed like a second, unrelated experiment. They\nwere told the experimenters were interested in what people share with others and were given a recent\narticle from the school newspaper. Then, after reading it, they were given the option of e-mailing it to\nanyone they liked.\nIn actuality, this “unrelated study” was part of my initial experiment. I wanted to test a simple but\nintriguing hypothesis. At this point we knew that emotionally arousing content or experiences would\nbe more likely to be shared. But I wondered whether the effects of arousal might be even broader than\nthat. If arousal induces sharing, then might any physiologically arousing experience drive people to\nshare stories and information with others?\nRunning in place provided the perfect test. Running doesn’t evoke emotion, but it is just as\nphysiologically arousing. It gets your heart rate up, increases blood pressure, etc. So if arousal of any\nsort boosts sharing, then running in place should lead people to share things with others. Even if the\nthings people are talking about or sharing have nothing to do with the reason they are experiencing\narousal.\nAnd it did. Among students who had been instructed to jog, 75 percent shared the article—more\nthan twice as many as the students who had been in the “relaxed” group. Thus any sort of arousal,\nwhether from emotional or physical sources, and even arousal due to the situation itself (rather than\ncontent), can boost transmission.\n—————\nUnderstanding that arousing situations can drive people to pass things on helps shed light on socalled\noversharing, when people disclose more than they should. Ever been stuck next to someone on\na plane who won’t stop sharing what seem like extremely personal details? Or find yourself in a\nconversation where later on you realize that you may have shared way more than you meant to? Why\ndoes this happen?\nSure, we may feel more comfortable with someone than we thought we would or we may have had\none too many margaritas. But there is also a third reason. If situational factors end up making us\nphysiologically aroused, we may end up sharing more than we planned.\nSo be careful the next time you step off the treadmill, barely avoid a car accident, or experience a\nturbulent plane ride. Because you’ve been aroused by these experiences, you may overshare\ninformation with others in the aftermath.\nThese ideas also suggest that one way to generate word of mouth is to find people when they are\nalready fired up. Exciting game shows like Deal or No Deal or anxiety-inducing crime dramas like\nCSI are more likely to get people aroused than documentaries about historical figures. These shows\nshould get more chatter themselves, sure, but the boosted heart rate they induce should also spill over\nand make people more likely to talk about the commercials that appear during the break. Ads at the\ngym may provoke lots of discussion simply because people are already so amped. Work groups may\nbenefit from taking walks together because it will encourage people to share their ideas and opinions.\nThe same idea holds for online content. Certain websites, news articles, or YouTube videos evoke\nmore arousal than others. Blogs about financial markets, articles about political cronyism, and\nhilarious videos are all likely to boost activation, which, in turn, should increase the transmission of\nads or other content that appears on those pages.\nAd timing also matters. Although a show may be generally arousing, a specific scene in that show\nmay be more activating than others. In crime shows, for example, the anxiety often peaks somewhere\nin the middle. When the crime is solved at the end, all tension dissipates. In game shows, excitement\n—and therefore arousal—is highest when contestants are about to find out how much they’ve won.\nWe may end up talking more about ads that show up close to these exciting moments.\n—————\nEmotions drive people to action. They make us laugh, shout, and cry, and they make us talk, share,\nand buy. So rather than quoting statistics or providing information, we need to focus on feelings. As\nAnthony Cafaro, the designer who helped develop the “Parisian Love” video at Google, noted:\nWhether it’s a digital product, like Google, or a physical product, like sneakers, you should\nmake something that will move people. People don’t want to feel like they’re being told\nsomething—they want to be entertained, they want to be moved.\nSome emotions kindle the fire more than others. As we discussed, activating emotion is the key to\ntransmission. Physiological arousal or activation drives people to talk and share. We need to get\npeople excited or make them laugh. We need to make them angry rather than sad. Even situations\nwhere people are active can make them more likely to pass things on to others.\nFluid dynamics and online search seem like two of the least moving topics out there. But by\nrelating these abstract topics to people’s own lives and evoking underlying emotion, Denise Grady\nand Anthony Cafaro got us to care, and share.\n4. Public\nKen Segall was Steve Jobs’s right hand man. For twelve years, Ken worked as creative director at\nJobs’s ad agency. He started with Apple’s account in the early 1980s. When Jobs was fired and\nstarted NeXT Computer, Ken moved to be part of the project. And when Jobs returned to Apple in\n1997, Ken came along as well. Ken worked on the “Think Different” campaign, was on the team that\ndeveloped the “Crazy Ones” ad, and started the iCraze by naming Apple’s bulbous all-in-one egglooking\ndesktop the iMac.\nDuring those later years, Ken’s team would sit down with Jobs every two weeks. It was a status\nmeeting of sorts. Ken’s team would share everything they were working on advertisingwise:\npromising ideas, new copy, and potential layouts. Jobs would do the same. He would update Ken’s\nteam on how Apple was doing, which products were selling, and whether anything new was coming\ndown the pipeline that they might need a campaign for.\nOne week, Jobs approached Ken’s team with a conundrum. Jobs was obsessed with the absolute\nbest possible user experience. He always put the customer first. Customers shelled out all that money;\nthey should be treated right. So Apple carried this mantra into all aspects of product design. From\nopening the box to calling for tech support. Ever notice the slow delay when you first pull the cover\noff the box of your new iPhone? That’s because Apple has been hard at work designing that\nexperience to provide the perfect feeling of luxury and heft.\nThe conundrum concerned the design of the new PowerBook G4. The laptop was going to be a\nmarvel of technology and design. Its titanium body was revolutionary—stronger than steel yet lighter\nthan aluminum. And, at less than one inch thick, it would be one of the thinnest laptops ever.\nBut Jobs wasn’t concerned about the laptop’s strength or weight. He was concerned about the\ndirection of the logo.\nThe cover of PowerBook laptops always had a small apple with a bite taken out of the side.\nConsistent with their user focus, Apple wanted the logo to look right to the owner of the computer.\nThis was particularly important given the frequency with which laptops are opened and closed.\nPeople stuff the laptops in their backpacks or bags only to pull them out later and start working. And\nwhen you pull the laptop out it’s hard to know which way is up. Which side has the latch and so\nshould face toward you when you set the laptop down on a desk or table?\nJobs wanted this experience to be as fluid as possible, so he used the logo as a compass. It faced\nthe user when the computer was closed so that the user could easily orient the laptop when he set it\ndown.\nBut the problem came when a person opened the laptop. Once the users had found a seat at the\ncoffee shop and sat down with their macchiato, they would open their computer to start working. And\nonce they opened the laptop the logo would flip. To everyone around them the logo would be upside\ndown.\nJobs was a big believer in branding, and seeing all those upside-down logos wasn’t a great feeling.\nHe was even worried it might be hurting the brand.\nSo Jobs asked Ken’s team a question. Which is more important—to have the logo look right to the\ncustomers before they opened their PowerBook, or to make it look right to the rest of the world when\nthe laptop was in use?\n—————\nAs you can see the next time you glance at an Apple laptop, Ken and Jobs reversed their long-held\nbeliefs and flipped the logo. The reason? Observability. Jobs realized that seeing others do something\nmakes people more likely to do it themselves.\nBut the key word here is “seeing.” If it’s hard to see what others are doing, it’s hard to imitate it.\nMaking something more observable makes it easier to imitate. Thus a key factor in driving products to\ncatch on is public visibility. If something is built to show, it’s built to grow.\nTHE PSYCHOLOGY OF IMITATION\nImagine you’re in an unfamiliar city. You’re out of town on a business trip or vacationing with a\nfriend and by the time you finally land, check into the hotel, and take a quick shower you’re famished.\nIt’s time for dinner.\nYou want to go somewhere good, but you don’t know the city that well. The concierge is busy and\nyou don’t want to spend a lot of time reading reviews on the Internet, so you decide to just find a\nplace nearby.\nBut when you step out onto the bustling street you’re struck by dozens of options. A cute Thai place\nwith a purple awning. A hip-looking tapas bar. An Italian bistro. How do you choose?\nIf you’re like most people you’d probably follow a time-tested rule of thumb: look for a restaurant\nfull of people. If lots of people are eating there, it’s probably good. If a place is empty, you should\nprobably keep on walking.\nThis is just one example of a much broader phenomenon. People often imitate those around them.\nThey dress in the same styles as their friends, pick entrées preferred by other diners, and reuse hotel\ntowels more when they think others are doing the same. People are more likely to vote if their spouse\nvotes, more likely to quit smoking if their friends quit, and more likely to get fat if their friends\nbecome obese. Whether making trivial choices like what brand of coffee to buy or important\ndecisions like paying their taxes, people tend to conform to what others are doing. Television shows\nuse canned laugh tracks for this reason: people are more likely to laugh when they hear others\nlaughing.\nPeople imitate, in part, because others’ choices provide information. Many decisions we make on a\ndaily basis are like choosing a restaurant in a foreign city, albeit with a little more information.\nWhich one is the salad fork again? What’s a good book to take on vacation? We don’t know the right\nanswer, and even if we have some sense of what to do, we’re not entirely sure.\nSo to help resolve our uncertainty, we often look to what other people are doing and follow that.\nWe assume that if other people are doing something, it must be a good idea. They probably know\nsomething we don’t. If our tablemates seem to be using the smaller fork to pick at the arugula, we do\nthe same. If lots of people seem to be reading that new John Grisham thriller, we buy it for our\nupcoming vacation.\nPsychologists call this idea “social proof.” This is why baristas and bartenders seed the tip jar at\nthe beginning of their shift by dropping in a handful of ones and maybe a five. If the tip jar is empty,\ntheir customers may assume that other people aren’t really tipping and decide not to tip much\nthemselves either. But if the tip jar is already brimming with money, they assume that everyone must\nbe tipping, and thus they should tip as well.\nSocial proof even plays a role in matters of life and death.\nImagine one of your kidneys fails. Your body relies on this organ to filter the toxins and waste\nproducts from your blood, but when it stops working, your whole body suffers. Sodium builds up,\nyour bones weaken, and you’re at risk of developing anemia or heart disease. If not treated quickly,\nyou will die.\nMore than 40,000 people in the United States come down with end-stage renal disease every year.\nTheir kidneys fail for one reason or another and they have two options: either go through timeconsuming\nback-and-forth visits to a treatment center three times a week for five-hour dialysis\ntreatments, or get a kidney transplant.\nBut there are not enough kidneys available for transplant. Currently more than 100,000 patients are\non the wait list; more than 4,000 new patients are added each month. Not surprisingly, people on the\nwait list for a kidney are eager to get one.\nImagine you are on that list. It is managed on a first-come, first-served basis, and available kidneys\nare offered first to people at the top of the list, who usually have been waiting the longest. You\nyourself have been waiting for months for an available kidney. You’re fairly low on the list, but\nfinally one day you’re offered a potential match. You’d take it, right?\nClearly, people who need a kidney to save their lives should take one when offered. But\nsurprisingly, 97.1 percent of kidney offers are refused.\nNow, many of those refusals are based on the kidney not being a good match. In this respect, getting\nan organ transplant is a bit like getting your car repaired. You can’t put a Honda carburetor in a\nBMW. Same with a kidney. If the tissue or blood type doesn’t match yours, the organ won’t work.\nBut when she looked at hundreds of kidney donations, MIT professor Juanjuan Zhang found that\nsocial proof also leads people to turn down available kidneys. Say you are the one hundredth person\non the list. A kidney would have first been offered to the first person on the list, then the second, and\nso on. So to finally reach you, it must have been turned down by ninety-nine other people. This is\nwhere social proof comes into play. If so many others have refused this kidney, people assume it must\nnot be very good. They infer it is low quality and are more likely to turn it down. In fact, such\ninferences lead one in every ten people who refuse a kidney to do so in error. Thousands of patients\nturn down kidneys they should have accepted. Even though people can’t communicate directly with\nothers on the list, they make their decisions based on others’ behavior.\n—————\nSimilar phenomena play out all the time.\nIn New York City, Halal Chicken and Gyro offers delicious platters of chicken and lamb, lightly\nseasoned rice, and pita bread. New York magazine ranked it as one of the top twenty food carts in the\ncity, and people wait up to an hour to get one of Halal’s tasty but inexpensive meals. Go during\ncertain times of day and the line will stretch all the way down the block.\nNow I know what you are thinking. People must wait that long because the food is really good. And\nyou’re partially right: the food is quite good.\nBut the same owners operate an almost identical food cart called Halal Guys right across the street.\nSame food, same packaging, basically an identical product. But there is no line. In fact, Halal Guys\nhas never developed the same devout following as its sibling. Why?\nSocial proof. People assume that the longer the line, the better the food must be.\nThis herd mentality even affects the type of careers people consider. Every year I ask my secondyear\nMBA students to do a short exercise. Half the students are asked what they thought they wanted\nto do with their life right when they started the MBA program. The other half are asked what they\nwant to do now. Neither group gets to see the question the other was asked and responses are\nanonymous.\nThe results are striking. Before they start the MBA program, students have a broad range of\nambitions. One wanted to reform the health care system, another wanted to build a new travel\nwebsite, and a third wanted to get involved in the entertainment industry. Someone wanted to run for\npolitical office and another student thought about becoming an entrepreneur. A handful say they want\nto go into investment banking or consulting. Overall, they possess a diverse set of interests, goals, and\ncareers paths.\nThe responses from students when asked what they want to do a year into the program are much\nmore homogeneous and concentrated. More than two-thirds say they want to get into investment\nbanking or consulting, with a small sprinkling of other careers.\nThe convergence is remarkable. Sure, people may learn about different opportunities during the\nMBA program, but part of this herding is driven by social influence. People aren’t sure what career\nto choose, so they look to others. And it snowballs. While less than 20 percent of people might have\nbeen interested in investment banking and consulting going into the program, that number is larger than\nany other career. A few people see that 20 percent and switch. A few more see those people switch,\nand they follow along. Soon the number is 30 percent. Which makes other people even more likely to\nswitch. Soon that 20 percent has become much larger. So through social influence this initially small\nadvantage gets magnified. Social interaction led students who originally preferred different paths to\ngo in the same direction.\nSocial influence has a big effect on behavior, but to understand how to use it to help products and\nideas catch on, we need to understand when its effects are strongest. And that brings us to Koreen\nJohannessen.\nTHE POWER OF OBSERVABILITY\nKoreen Johannessen started at the University of Arizona as a clinical social worker. Originally, she\nwas hired by the mental health group to help students deal with problems like depression and drug\nabuse. But after years of treating students, Johannessen realized that she was working on the wrong\nend of the problem. Sure, she could try to fix the ongoing issues that afflicted students, but it would be\nmuch better to prevent them before they started. So Johannessen moved over to the campus health\ngroup and took over health education, eventually becoming the director of health promotion and\npreventive services.\nAs at most universities in the United States, one of the biggest issues at Arizona was alcohol abuse.\nMore than three-quarters of American college students under the legal drinking age report drinking\nalcohol. But the bigger concern was the quantity that students consume. Forty-four percent of students\nbinge-drink, and more than 1,800 U.S. college students die every year from alcohol-related injuries.\nAnother 600,000 are injured while under the influence of alcohol. It’s a huge issue.\nJohannessen addressed the problem head-on. She papered the campus with flyers detailing the\nnegative consequences of bingeing. She placed ads in the school paper with information about how\nalcohol affects cognitive functioning and performance in school. She even set up a coffin at the\nstudent center with statistics about the number of alcohol-related deaths. But none of these initiatives\nseemed to put much of a dent in the problem. Simply educating students about the risks of alcohol\ndidn’t seem to be enough.\nSo Johannessen tried asking the students how they felt about drinking.\nSurprisingly, she found that most students said they were not comfortable with the drinking habits\nof their peers. Sure, they might enjoy a casual drink once in a while, just like most adults. But they\nweren’t into the heavy binge drinking they saw among other students. They spoke distastefully about\nthe times they nursed a hungover roommate or held someone’s hair while she threw up in the toilet.\nSo while their peers seemed fine with the drinking culture, they weren’t.\nJohannessen was pleased. The fact that most students were against binge drinking seemed to bode\nwell for eliminating the drinking problem—until she thought about it closely.\nIf most students were uncomfortable with the drinking culture, then why was it happening in the\nfirst place? Why were students drinking so much if they don’t actually like it?\nBecause behavior is public and thoughts are private.\nPut yourself in a college student’s situation. When you look around, you’d see a lot of drinking.\nYou’d see tailgates at the football games, keg parties at the frat house, and open bars at the sorority\nformal. You’d witness your peers drinking and seeming happy about it, so you’d assume that you are\nthe outlier and that everyone else likes drinking more than you do. So you’d have another drink.\nBut what students don’t realize is that everyone is having similar thoughts. Their peers are having\nthe same experience. They see others drinking, so they drink, too. And the cycle continues because\npeople can’t read one another’s thoughts. If they could, they’d realize that everyone felt the same way.\nAnd they wouldn’t feel all this social proof compelling them to drink as much.\nFor a more familiar example, think about the last time you sat through a bewildering PowerPoint\npresentation. Something about equity diversification or supply chain reorganization. At the end of the\ntalk, the speaker probably asked the audience if anyone had any questions.\nThe response?\nSilence.\nBut not because everyone else understood the presentation. The others were probably just as\nbewildered as you were. But while they would have liked to raise their hands, they didn’t because\neach one is worried that he or she is the only person who didn’t understand. Why? Because no one\nelse was asking questions. No one saw any public signal that others were confused so everyone keeps\nhis doubts to him- or herself. Because behavior is public and thoughts are private.\n—————\nThe famous phrase “Monkey see, monkey do” captures more than just the human penchant for\nimitation. People can imitate only when they can see what others are doing. College students may\npersonally be against binge drinking, but they binge because that is what they observe others doing. A\nrestaurant might be extremely popular, but if it’s hard to see inside (e.g., the front windows are\nfrosted), there is no way passersby can use that information to inform their own choices.\nObservability has a huge impact on whether products and ideas catch on. Say a clothing company\nintroduces a new shirt style. If you see someone wearing it and decide you like it, you can go buy the\nsame shirt, or something similar. But this is much less likely to happen with socks.\nWhy?\nBecause shirts are public and socks are private. They’re harder to see.\nThe same goes for toothpaste versus cars. You probably don’t know what kind of toothpaste your\nneighbors use. It’s hidden inside their house, inside their bathroom, inside a cabinet. You’re more\nlikely to know what car they drive. And because car preferences are easier to observe, it’s much\nmore likely that your neighbors’ purchase behavior can influence yours.\nMy colleagues Blake McShane, Eric Bradlow, and I tested this idea using data on 1.5 million car\nsales. Would a neighbor buying a new car be enough to get you to buy a new one?\nSure enough, we found a pretty impressive effect. People who lived in, say, Denver, were more\nlikely to buy a new car if other Denverites had bought new cars recently. And the effect was pretty\nbig. Approximately one out of every eight cars sold was because of social influence.\nEven more impressive was the role of observability in these effects. Cities vary in how easy it is to\nsee what other people are driving. People in Los Angeles tend to commute by car, so they are more\nlikely to see what others are driving than New Yorkers, who commute by subway. In sunny places\nlike Miami, you can more easily see what the person next to you is driving than in rainy cities like\nSeattle. By affecting observability, these conditions also determined the effect of social influence on\nauto purchases. People were more influenced by others’ purchases in places like Los Angeles and\nMiami, where it is easier to see what others were driving. Social influence was stronger when\nbehavior was more observable.\nObservable things are also more likely to be discussed. Ever walked into someone’s office or\nhome and inquired about a weird paperweight on the desk or a colorful art print on the living room\nwall? Imagine if those items were locked in a safe or tucked away in the basement. Would they get\ntalked about as much? Probably not. Public visibility boosts word of mouth. The easier something is\nto see, the more people talk about it.\nObservability also spurs purchase and action. As we discussed in the Triggers chapter, cues in the\nenvironment not only boost word of mouth but also remind people about things they already wanted to\nbuy or do. You may have meant to eat healthier or visit that new website your friend mentioned, but\nwithout a visible trigger to jog your memory, you’re more likely to forget. The more public a product\nor service is, the more it triggers people to take action.\nSo how can products or ideas be made more publicly observable?\nMAKING THE PRIVATE PUBLIC . . . WITH MOUSTACHES\nEvery fall I teach about sixty MBA students at the Wharton School, and by the end of October I’ve\ngotten some sense of most of the students in the class. I know who is going to be five minutes late\nevery day, who will be the first to raise a hand, and who will be dressed like a prima donna.\nSo I was a bit surprised a few years ago when I walked into class in early November to see what\nI’d thought was a pretty buttoned-down guy sporting a big moustache. It wasn’t simply that he had\nforgotten to shave; he had a full handlebar with ends almost ready to curl up on the sides. He looked\nlike a cross between Rollie Fingers and a villain in an old black-and-white movie.\nAt first I thought he must be trying a facial hair experiment. But then when I looked around the room\nI noticed two other new moustache devotees. A trend seemed to be catching on. What precipitated the\nsudden outburst of moustaches?\n—————\nEvery year, cancer claims the lives of more than 4.2 million men worldwide. More than 6 million\nnew cases are diagnosed each year. Thanks to generous donations, great headway has been made in\nresearch and treatment. But how can organizations that work to fight this disease leverage social\ninfluence to increase donations?\nUnfortunately, as with many causes, whether you support a particular cancer fund is typically a\nprivate matter. If you’re like most people, you probably have little idea which of your neighbors,\ncoworkers, or even friends have donated to help fight this disease. So there is no way for their\nbehavior to influence yours or vice versa.\nAnd that is where the moustaches come in.\nIt all started one Sunday afternoon in 2003. A group of friends from Melbourne, Australia, were\nsitting around drinking beers. The conversation meandered in various directions and finally ended up\non 1970s and 80s fashion. “What ever happened to the moustache?” one guy asked. A few beers more\nand they came up with a challenge: to see who could grow the best moustache. The word spread to\ntheir other friends, and eventually they had a small group of thirty people. All grew moustaches for\nthe thirty days of November.\nEveryone had so much fun that the next November they decided to do it again. But this time they\ndecided to put a cause behind their efforts. Inspired by the work being done with breast cancer\nawareness, they wanted to do something similar for men’s health. So they formed the Movember\nFoundation and adopted the tagline “Changing the face of men’s health.” That year 450 guys raised\n$54,000 for the Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia.\nIt grew from there. Next year there were more than 9,000 participants. The following year, more\nthan 50,000. Soon the annual event started spreading around the world. In 2007, events were launched\neverywhere from Ireland and Denmark to South Africa and Taiwan. The organization has since raised\nmore than $174 million worldwide. Not bad for a few tufts of facial hair.\nNow, every November, men pledge to raise awareness and money by growing moustaches. The\nrules are simple. Start the first of the month with a clean-shaven face. For the rest of the month, grow\nand groom a moustache. Oh—and along the way, conduct yourself like a true country gentleman.\nThe Movember Foundation succeeded because they figured out how to make the private public.\nThey figured out how to take support for an abstract cause—something not typically observable—and\nmake it something that everyone can see. For the thirty days of November people who sport a\nmoustache effectively become walking, talking billboards for the cause. As noted on Movember’s\nwebsite,\nThrough their actions and words they [participants] raise awareness by prompting private\nand public conversations around the often-ignored issue of men’s health.\nAnd start conversation it does. Seeing someone you know suddenly sprout a moustache generates\ndiscussion. People usually gossip a bit among themselves until someone gets up the courage to ask the\nwearer what prompted the new facial hair. And when he explains, he shares the social currency and\ngenerates new devotees. Each year I see more and more of my students sporting moustaches come\nNovember. Making the cause public helped it catch on more quickly than it ever could have\notherwise.\n—————\nMost products, ideas, and behaviors are consumed privately. What websites do your coworkers\nlike? Which ballot initiatives do your neighbors support? Unless they tell you, you may never know.\nAnd though that might not matter to you personally, it matters a lot for the success of organizations,\nbusinesses, and ideas. If people can’t see what others are choosing and doing, they can’t imitate them.\nAnd, like the binge-drinking college students, people might change their behavior for the worse\nbecause they feel their views aren’t supported.*\nSolving this problem requires making the private public. Generating public signals for private\nchoices, actions, and opinions. Taking what was once an unobservable thought or behavior and\ntransforming it into a more observable one.\nKoreen Johannessen was able to reduce Arizona students’ drinking by making the private public.\nShe created ads in the school newspaper that merely stated the true norm. That most students had only\none or two drinks, and 69 percent have four or fewer drinks, when they party. She didn’t focus on the\nhealth consequences of drinking, she focused on social information. By showing students that the\nmajority of their peers weren’t bingeing, she helped them realize that others felt the same way. That\nmost students didn’t want to binge. This corrected the false inferences students had made about\nothers’ behavior and led them to reduce their own drinking as a result. By making the private public,\nJohannessen was able to decrease heavy drinking by almost 30 percent.\nADVERTISING ITSELF: SHARING HOTMAIL WITH THE WORLD\nOne way to make things more public is to design ideas that advertise themselves.\nOn July 4, 1996, Sabeer Bhatia and Jack Smith introduced a new e-mail service called Hotmail. At\nthe time, most people got their e-mail through Internet service providers like AOL. You’d pay a\nmonthly fee, dial up from home using a phone line, and access your messages through the AOL\ninterface. It was restricting. You could connect only from the place where you had the service\ninstalled. You were chained to one computer.\nBut Hotmail was different. It was one of the first Web-based e-mail services, which allowed\npeople to access their inbox from any computer anywhere in the world. All they needed was an\nInternet connection and a Web browser. Independence Day was chosen for the announcement to\nsymbolize how the service freed people from being locked into their current provider.\nHotmail was a great product, and it also scored well on a number of the word-of-mouth drivers\nwe’ve talked about so far. At the time, it was quite remarkable to be able to access e-mail from\nanywhere. So early adopters liked talking about it because it gave them Social Currency. The product\nalso offered users significant benefits over other e-mail services (for starters, it was free!), so many\npeople shared it for its Practical Value.\nBut the creators of Hotmail did more than just create a great product. They also cleverly leveraged\nobservability to help their product catch on.\nEvery e-mail sent from a Hotmail account was like a short plug for the growing brand. At the\nbottom was a message and link that simply said “Get Your Private, Free E-mail from Hotmail at\nwww.hotmail.com.” Every time current Hotmail customers sent an e-mail, they also sent prospective\ncustomers a bit of social proof—an implicit endorsement for this previously unknown service.\nAnd it worked. In a little over a year Hotmail signed up more than 8.5 million subscribers. Soon\nafter, Microsoft bought the burgeoning service for $400 million. Since then more than 350 million\nusers have signed up.\nApple and BlackBerry have adopted the same strategy. The signature lines at the bottom of their emails\noften say “Sent using BlackBerry” or “Sent from my iPhone.” Users can easily change this\ndefault message to something else (one of my colleagues changed his signature to say “Sent by Carrier\nPigeon”), but most people don’t, in part because they like the Social Currency the notes provide. And\nby leaving these notes on their e-mail, people also help spread awareness about the brand and\ninfluence others to try it.\n—————\nAll these examples involve products that advertise themselves. Every time people use the product\nor service they also transmit social proof or passive approval because usage is observable.\nMany companies apply this idea through prominent branding. Abercrombie & Fitch, Nike, and\nBurberry all garnish their products with brand names or distinctive logos and patterns. For Sale signs\nbroadcast which Realtor the seller is working with.\nFollowing the notion that more is better, some companies have increased the size of their logos.\nRalph Lauren has always been known for its characteristic polo player, but its Big Pony shirts made\nthis famous emblem sixteen times larger. Not to be outdone in the escalation for logo supremacy,\nLacoste made a similar move. The alligator on its Oversized Croc polo shirt is so large it looks as if\nit will bite the arm off of any person wearing it.\nBut large logos aren’t the only way products can advertise themselves. Take Apple’s decision to\nmake iPod headphones white. When Apple first introduced the iPod, there was lots of competition in\nthe digital music player space. Diamond Multimedia, Creative, Compaq, and Archos all offered\nplayers, and music on one company’s device couldn’t easily be transferred to another. Further, it\nwasn’t clear which, if any, of these competing standards would stick around, and whether it was\nworth switching from a portable CD player or Walkman to buy this new, expensive device.\nBut because most devices came with black headphones, Apple’s white headphone cords stood out.\nBy advertising themselves, the headphones made it easy to see how many other people were\nswitching away from the traditional Walkman and adopting the iPod. This was visible social proof\nthat suggested the iPod was a good product and made potential adopters feel more comfortable about\npurchasing it as well.\nShapes, sounds, and a host of other distinctive characteristics can also help products advertise\nthemselves. Pringles come in a unique tube. Computers using the Microsoft operating system make a\ndistinctive sound when they boot up. In 1992, French footwear designer Christian Louboutin felt his\nshoes lacked energy. Looking around, he noticed the striking red Chanel nail polish an employee was\nwearing. That’s it! he thought, and applied the polish to his shoes’ soles. Now Louboutin shoes\nalways come with red-lacquered soles, making them instantly recognizable. They’re distinctive and\neasy to see, even for people who know little about the brand.\nSimilar ideas can be applied to a host of products and services. Tailors give away suit bags\nimprinted with the tailor’s name. Nightclubs use sparklers to broadcast when someone pays to get\nbottle service. Tickets usually sit in people’s pockets, but if theater companies and minor league\nteams could use buttons or stickers as the “ticket” instead, “tickets” would be much more publicly\nobservable.\nDesigning products that advertise themselves is a particularly powerful strategy for small\ncompanies or organizations that don’t have a lot of resources. Even when there is no money to buy\ntelevision ads or a spot in the local paper, existing customers can act as advertisements if the product\nadvertises itself. It’s like advertising without an advertising budget.\n—————\nA product, idea, or behavior advertises itself when people consume it. When people wear certain\nclothes, attend a rally, or use a website, they make it more likely that their friends, coworkers, and\nneighbors will see what they are doing and imitate it.\nIf a company or organization is lucky, people consume its product or service often. But what about\nthe rest of the time? When consumers are wearing other clothes, supporting a different cause, or doing\nsomething else entirely? Is there something that generates social proof that sticks around even when\nthe product is not being used or the idea is not top of mind?\nYes. And it’s called behavioral residue.\nLIVESTRONG WRISTBANDS AS BEHAVIORAL RESIDUE\nScott MacEachern had a tough decision to make. In 2003, Lance Armstrong was a hot commodity. As\nhis sponsor at Nike, MacEachern was trying to figure out the best way to harness all the attention\nLance was getting.\nLance had a powerful story. Diagnosed with life-threatening testicular cancer seven years earlier,\nLance had been given only a 40 percent chance of survival. But he surprised everyone not only by\nreturning to cycling, but by coming back stronger than ever. Since his return, he had won the Tour de\nFrance an astounding five times in a row and inspired millions of people along the way. From fifteenyear-\nolds dealing with cancer to college students trying to stay in shape, Lance helped people to\nbelieve. If he could come back from cancer, they could overcome the challenges in their own lives.\n(Note that in the decade since 2003, it has become apparent that Armstrong may have achieved his\nsuccess through the use of performance-enhancing drugs. But given the powerful success of\nLivestrong wristbands, and the Lance Armstrong Foundation more generally, it is worth considering\nhow they became popular, outside of whether Armstrong’s personal story is tainted or not.)\nMacEachern wanted to capitalize on this enthusiasm. Lance had transcended sports. He had\nbecome not only a hero, but a cultural icon. MacEachern wanted to recognize Lance’s achievements\nand celebrate his upcoming attempt at a record sixth Tour de France victory. He also wanted to use\nthe outpouring of interest and support to raise funds and awareness for the Lance Armstrong\nFoundation.\nMacEachern developed two potential ideas.\nThe first idea was a bike ride across America. People would set a mileage goal for themselves and\nget friends or family members to sponsor their ride. It would get more people to exercise, boost\ninterest in cycling, and raise money for the Lance Armstrong Foundation. Lance might even do part of\nthe trip. The event would take weeks and likely garner significant media coverage both nationally and\nlocally in all the cities the ride covered.\nThe second idea was a wristband. Nike had recently begun selling Baller Bands, silicone rubber\nbands with inspirational messages like “TEAM” or “RESPECT” on the inside. Basketball players\nwore them to stay focused and increase motivation. Why not make a wristband focused on\nArmstrong? Nike could make 5 million of the bands, sell them for a dollar each, and give all the\nproceeds to the Lance Armstrong Foundation.\nMacEachern liked the wristband idea, but when he pitched it to Lance’s advisors they weren’t\nconvinced. The foundation thought the bands would be a dud. Bill Stapleton, Armstrong’s agent,\nthought they had no chance of success and called them “a stupid idea.” Even Armstrong was\nincredulous, saying, “What are we going to do with the 4.9 million that we don’t sell?”\nMacEachern was stuck. While he liked the wristband idea, he wasn’t sure it would fly. But then he\nmade one seemingly innocuous decision that had a big impact on the product’s success. MacEachern\nmade the wristbands yellow.\n—————\nYellow was chosen because it is the color of the race leader’s jersey in the Tour de France. It’s\nalso not strongly associated with either gender, making it easy for both men and women to wear.\nBut it was also a smart decision from an observability perspective. Yellow is a color people\nalmost never see.\nAnd it is striking. Yellow stands out against almost anything people wear, making it easy to see a\nLivestrong wristband from far away.\nThis public visibility helped make the product a huge success. Not only did Nike sell the first 5\nmillion bands, but it did so within the first six months of release. Production couldn’t keep up with\ndemand. The wristbands were such a hot item that people started bidding ten times the retail price to\nsnag them on eBay. In the end, more than 85 million wristbands were sold. You might even know\nsomeone who wears one to this day. Not bad for a little piece of plastic.\nIt’s hard to know how well the ride across America would have done if Nike had implemented it.\nAnd it’s easy to Monday-morning-quarterback a successful strategy and say it was obviously the\nbetter choice. But regardless, one thing is clear: the wristband creates more behavioral residue than\nthe cross-country ride ever could have. As MacEachern keenly noted:\nThe nice thing about a wristband is that it lives on. The bike ride doesn’t. There’ll be pictures\nof the bike ride and people will talk about the bike ride, but unless it goes on every year—\neven if it does go on every year, it doesn’t live on as a reminder every day of this sort of stuff.\nBut the wristband does.\nBehavioral residue is the physical traces or remnants that most actions or behaviors leave in their\nwake. Mystery lovers have shelves full of mystery novels. Politicos frame photos of themselves\nshaking hands with famous politicians. Runners have trophies, T-shirts, or medals from participating\nin 5Ks.\nAs discussed in the chapter on Social Currency, items like the Livestrong wristband provide\ninsight into who people are and what they like. Even things that would otherwise be difficult to\nobserve, like whether a person donates to a particular cause or prefers mysteries to historical fiction.\nBut when publicly visible, these remnants facilitate imitation and provide chances for people to\ntalk about related products or ideas.\nTake voting. It’s hard to get people to turn out to vote. They have to figure out where their polling\nstations are located, take the morning off from work, and stand in line, sometimes for hours, until they\nget the chance to cast their ballots. But these hurdles are compounded by the fact that voting is a\nprivate act. Unless you actually happen to see all the people who go to the polls, you have no idea\nhow many other people decided voting was worth the effort. So there is not much social proof.\nBut in the 1980s election officials came up with a nice way to make voting more observable: the “I\nVoted” sticker. Simple enough, but by creating behavioral residue, the sticker made the private act of\nvoting much more public, even after people left the polling station. It provided a ready reminder that\ntoday is the day to vote, others are doing it, and you should too.\n—————\nBehavioral residue exists for all types of products and ideas. Tiffany, Victoria’s Secret, and a host\nof other retailers give customers disposable shopping bags to carry their purchases home. But\nbecause of the Social Currency associated with some of these retailers, many consumers reuse the\nbags rather than tossing them. They use the Victoria’s Secret bags to carry their gym clothes, toss their\nlunch into a Tiffany bag, or use Bloomingdale’s famous medium brown bag to carry papers around\ntown. People even reuse bags from restaurants, discount stores, and other places that are not status\nsymbols.\nClothing retailer Lululemon takes this idea one step further. Rather than make paper bags that are\nrelatively durable, it makes shopping bags that are hard to throw away. Made of sturdy plastic like\nreusable grocery bags, these bags are clearly meant to be reused. So people use them to carry\ngroceries or do other errands. But along the way this behavioral residue helps provide social proof\nfor the brand.\nGiveaways can also provide behavioral residue. Go to any conference, job fair, or large meeting\nwhere presenters have set up booths and you’ll be stunned by the amount of swag they give away.\nMugs, pens, and T-shirts. Beverage cozies, stress balls, and ice scrapers. A couple of years ago the\nWharton School even gave me a tie.\nBut some of these giveaways provide better behavioral residue than others. Giving away a makeup\ncarrying case is fine, but women usually apply makeup in the privacy of their bathrooms, so it doesn’t\nmake the brand that observable. Coffee mugs and gym bags might be used less frequently, but their use\nis more publicly visible.\nPeople posting their opinions and behavior online also provide behavioral residue. Reviews,\nblogs, posts, or other sorts of content all leave evidence that others can find later. For this reason,\nmany businesses and organizations encourage people to Like them—or their content—on Facebook.\nBy simply clicking the Like button, people not only show their affinity with a product, idea, or\norganization, they also help spread the word that something is good or worth paying attention to. ABC\nNews found that installing these buttons boosted its Facebook traffic by 250 percent.\nOther sites push, or automatically post, what people do to their social networking pages. Music has\nalways been a somewhat social activity, but Spotify takes this a step further. The system allows you\nto listen to whatever songs you like but also posts what you’re listening to on your Facebook page,\nmaking it easier for your friends to see what you like (and letting them know about Spotify). Many\nother websites do the same.\nBut should we always try to make things public? Are there ever instances when making something\npublic could be a bad idea?\nANTI-DRUG COMMERCIALS?\nA sprightly, dark-haired teenager walks down the stairs of her apartment building. She’s wearing a\npretty silver necklace and carrying a sweater in her hand. She could be on her way to work or to meet\nup with a friend for coffee. Suddenly a neighbor’s door opens and a voice whispers, “I got some good\npot for you.”\n“No!” She scowls and hurries down the stairs.\nA fresh-faced kid is sitting outside. He is wearing a blue sweatshirt and sports a bowl haircut that\nused to be popular among boys. He appears deeply engrossed in a video game when a voice\ninterrupts him. “Cocaine?” the voice asks. “No thanks,” the kid replies.\nA young man is standing against a wall chewing gum. “Yo, my man, want some ’ludes?” the voice\ninquires. “No way!” the man exclaims, glaring back.\n“Just Say No” is one of the most famous anti-drug campaigns of all time. Created by First Lady\nNancy Reagan during her husband’s presidency, the campaign ran public service announcements as\npart of a national effort to discourage teens from recreational drug use in the 1980s and 1990s.\nThe logic was simple. One way or another, kids are going to be asked if they want to use drugs.\nWhether by a friend, a stranger, or somebody else. And they needed to know how to say no. So the\ngovernment spent millions of dollars on anti-drug public service announcements. It hoped that the\nmessages would teach kids how to react in these situations and, as a result, decrease drug use.\nMore recent campaigns have relied on the same idea. Between 1998 and 2004, Congress\nappropriated almost $1 billion for the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign. The goal was to\neducate kids ages twelve to eighteen to enable them to reject drugs.\nCommunications professor Bob Hornik wanted to see whether anti-drug ads were actually\neffective. So he collected data on the drug use of thousands of teens over the time the anti-drug ads\nran. Whether teens had seen the ads and whether they had ever smoked marijuana. Then he looked at\nwhether the public service announcements seemed to decrease marijuana use.\nThey didn’t.\nIn fact, the messages actually seemed to increase drug use. Kids aged twelve and a half to eighteen\nwho saw the ads were actually more likely to smoke marijuana. Why?\nBecause it made drug use more public.\nThink about observability and social proof. Before seeing the message, some kids might never have\nthought about taking drugs. Others might have considered it but have been wary about doing the wrong\nthing.\nBut anti-drug ads often say two things simultaneously. They say that drugs are bad, but they also say\nthat other people are doing them. And as we’ve discussed throughout this chapter, the more others\nseem to be doing something, the more likely people are to think that thing is right or normal and what\nthey should be doing as well.\nImagine you’re a fifteen-year-old who has never considered using drugs. You’re sitting at home\nwatching cartoons one afternoon when a public service announcement comes on telling you about the\ndangers of drug use. Someone’s going to ask you if you want to try drugs and you need to be ready to\nsay no. Or even worse, the cool kids are going to be the ones asking. But you shouldn’t say yes.\nYou never see public service announcements for avoiding cutting off your hand with a saw or not\ngetting hit by a bus, so if the government spent the time and money to tell you about drugs, a lot of\nyour peers must be doing them, right? Some of them are apparently the coolest kids in school. And\nyou had no idea!\nAs Hornik said,\nOur basic hypothesis is that the more kids saw these ads, the more they came to believe that\nlots of other kids were using marijuana. And the more they came to believe that other kids\nwere using marijuana, the more they became interested in using it themselves.\nAs with many powerful tools, making things more public can have unintended consequences when\nnot applied carefully. If you want to get people not to do something, don’t tell them that lots of their\npeers are doing it.\nTake the music industry. It thought it could stop illegal downloads by showing people how big the\nproblem is. So the industry association’s website sternly warns people that “only 37 percent of music\nacquired by U.S. consumers . . . was paid for” and that in the past few years “approximately 30\nbillion songs were illegally downloaded.”\nBut I’m not sure that message has the desired effect. If anything, it may have the opposite effect.\nLess than half of people are paying for their music? Wow. Seems like you’d have to be an idiot to pay\nfor it then, right?\nEven in cases where most people are doing the right thing, talking about the minority who are doing\nthe wrong thing can encourage people to give in to temptation.\nRather than making the private public, preventing a behavior requires the opposite: making the\npublic private. Making others’ behavior less observable.\nOne way is to highlight what people should be doing instead. Psychologist Bob Cialdini and\ncolleagues wanted to decrease the number of people who stole petrified wood from Arizona’s\nPetrified Forest National Park. So they posted signs around the park that tried different strategies.\nOne asked people not to take the wood because “many past visitors have removed petrified wood\nfrom the Park, changing the natural state of the Petrified Forest.” But by providing social proof that\nothers were stealing, the message had a perverse effect, almost doubling the number of people taking\nwood!\nHighlighting what people should do was much more effective. Over a different set of trails they\ntried a different sign that stated, “Please don’t remove the petrified wood from the Park, in order to\npreserve the natural state of the Petrified Forest.” By focusing on the positive effects of not taking the\nwood, rather than on what others were doing, the park service was able to reduce theft.\n—————\nIt’s been said that when people are free to do as they please, they usually imitate one another. We\nlook to others for information about what is right or good to do in a given situation, and this social\nproof shapes everything from the products we buy to the candidates we vote for.\nBut as we discussed, the phrase “Monkey see, monkey do” captures more than just our tendency to\nfollow others. If people can’t see what others are doing, they can’t imitate them. So to get our\nproducts and ideas to become popular we need to make them more publicly observable. For Apple\nthis was as easy as flipping its logo. By cleverly leveraging moustaches, Movember drew huge\nattention and donations for men’s cancer research.\nSo we need to be like Hotmail and Apple and design products that advertise themselves. We need\nto be like Lululemon and Livestrong and create behavioral residue, discernible evidence that sticks\naround even after people have used our product or engaged with our ideas. We need to make the\nprivate public. If something is built to show, it’s built to grow.\n* Making the public private is particularly important for things that people may not have originally felt comfortable talking about. Take\nonline dating. Many people have tried it, but it is still somewhat stigmatized in the culture at large. And part of this stigma is due to the\nfact that people are unaware that many people they know have tried it. Online dating is relatively private behavior, so to help it catch on,\nonline dating companies need to make people more aware how many others are doing it. Similar issues pop up in other domains. The\nmakers of Viagra coined the term “ED” (erectile dysfunction) to get people more comfortable talking about what was once a private\nissue. Many colleges started a “wear jeans if you’re gay” day, in part just to raise awareness and discussion for the LGBT community.\n5. Practical Value\nIf you had to pick someone to make a viral video, Ken Craig probably wouldn’t be your first\nchoice. Most viral videos are made by adolescents and watched by adolescents. Crazy tricks\nsomeone did on his motorcycle or cartoon characters edited to look as if they are dancing to rap\nsongs. Things young people love.\nBut Ken Craig is eighty-six years old. And the video that went viral? It’s about shucking corn.\nKen was born on a farm in Oklahoma, one of five brothers and sisters. His family’s livelihood was\nbuilt around growing cotton. They also kept a garden to grow things for the family to eat. And among\nthose things was corn. Ken’s been eating corn since the 1920s. He’s eaten everything from corn\ncasserole and corn chowder to corn fritters and corn salad. One of his favorite ways to eat corn is\nstraight off the cob. Nice and fresh.\nBut if you’ve ever eaten corn on the cob you know that there are two problems. In addition to\nkernels getting stuck in your teeth, there are those pesky threadlike strands (called corn silk) that\nalways seem stuck to the corn. A couple of strong pulls and you can easily peel the husk off, but the\nsilk seems to cling on for dear life. You can rub the corn, carefully pick at it with tweezers, or try\nalmost anything else you like, but whatever you do there always seem to be a couple of wayward silk\nstrands left over.\nAnd this is where Ken comes in.\nLike most eighty-six-year-olds, Ken’s not really into the Internet. He doesn’t have a blog, a channel\non YouTube, or any sort of online presence. In fact, to this day he has made only one YouTube video.\nEver.\nA couple of years ago, Ken’s daughter-in-law was over at his house making dinner. She had almost\nfinished cooking the main dish, and when it got close to time to eat, she told him that the corn was\nready to be shucked. Okay, Ken said, but let me show you a little trick.\nHe took unshucked ears of corn and tossed them in a microwave. Four minutes an ear. Once they\nwere done, he took a kitchen knife and cut a half inch or so off the bottom. Then he grabbed the husk\nat the top of the corn, gave it a quick couple of shakes, and out popped the ear of corn. Clean as a\nwhistle. No silk.\nHis daughter-in-law was so impressed she said they’d have to make a video to send to her daughter\nwho was teaching English in Korea. So the next day she shot a clip of Ken in his kitchen, talking\nthrough his trick for clean ears of corn. To make it easier for her daughter to see, she posted it on\nYouTube. And along the way she sent the clip to a couple of friends.\nWell, those friends sent it to a couple of friends, who also sent it to a couple of friends. Soon\nKen’s “Clean Ears Everytime” video took off. It collected more than 5 million views.\nBut unlike most viral videos that skew toward young people, this one skewed in the opposite\ndirection. Topping the charts of the videos viewed most by people above the age of fifty-five. In fact,\nthe video might have spread even faster if more senior citizens were online.\nWhy did people share this video?\n—————\nA couple of years ago I went hiking with my brother in the mountains of North Carolina. He was\nwrapping up a tough year of medical school, and I needed a break from work, so we met at Raleigh-\nDurham Airport and drove west. Past the Tar Heel blue of Chapel Hill, past the once tobaccosaturated\ncity of Winston-Salem, and all the way to the Blue Ridge Mountains that hug the\nwesternmost portion of the state. The next morning we woke up early, packed food for the day, and\nset out on a winding mountain ridge path that led to the top of a majestic plateau.\nThe main reason people go hiking is to get away from it all. To escape from the hustle and bustle of\nthe city and to immerse themselves in nature. No billboards, no traffic, no advertising, just you and\nnature.\nBut that morning while we were hiking in the woods, we came across the most peculiar thing. As\nwe rounded the bend on a downhill portion of the trail there was a group of hikers in front of us. We\nwalked behind them for a couple of minutes, and being a curious guy, I happened to eavesdrop on\ntheir conversation. I thought they might be talking about the beautiful weather, or the long descent we\nhad just covered.\nBut they weren’t.\nThey were talking about vacuum cleaners.\nWhether one particular model was really worth its premium price, and whether another model\nwould do the job just as well.\nVacuum cleaners? There were thousands of other things these hikers could have talked about.\nWhere to stop for lunch, the rushing sixty-foot falls they had just passed, even politics. But vacuum\ncleaners?\n—————\nIt’s not easy to explain Ken Craig’s viral corn video using the dimensions we’ve talked about so\nfar in this book, but it’s even harder to explain the hikers chatting about vacuum cleaners. They\nweren’t talking about anything particularly remarkable, so Social Currency wasn’t playing much of a\nrole. While there are lots of cues for vacuums in the home, or even in a city, there aren’t many\nTriggers for vacuum cleaners in the forest. Finally, while a clever campaign could figure out how to\nmake vacuum cleaners more Emotional, the hikers were just having a basic conversation about\nfeatures different vacuums offered. So what was driving them to talk?\nThe answer is simple. People like to pass along practical, useful information. News others can use.\nIn the context of Triggers or hidden bars like Please Don’t Tell, practical value may not seem like\nthe sexiest or most exciting concept. Some might even say it’s obvious or intuitive. But that doesn’t\nmean that it’s not consequential. When writer and editor William F. Buckley Jr. was asked which\nsingle book he would take with him to a desert island, his reply was straightforward: “A book on\nshipbuilding.”\nUseful things are important.\nFurther, as the stories of Ken’s corn and the vacuum-discussing hikers illustrate, people don’t just\nvalue practical information, they share it. Offering practical value helps make things contagious.\n—————\nPeople share practically valuable information to help others. Whether by saving a friend time or\nensuring a colleague saves a couple of bucks next time he goes to the supermarket, useful information\nhelps.\nIn this way, sharing practically valuable content is like a modern-day barn raising. Barns are large\nand costly structures that are difficult for one family to pay for or to assemble by itself. So in the\neighteenth and nineteenth centuries, communities would collectively build a barn for one of their\nmembers. People would get together, volunteer their time, and help their neighbor. Next time around,\nthe barn would be built for someone else. You can think of it as an early version of the current\nprosocial ideal of “pay it forward.”\nToday, these direct opportunities to help others are fewer and farther between. Modern suburban\nlife has distanced us from our friends and neighbors. We live at the end of long driveways or high up\nin apartment buildings, often barely getting to know the person next door. Many people move away\nfrom their families for work or school, reducing face-to-face contact with our strongest social ties.\nHired labor has taken the place of community barn raising.\nBut sharing something useful with others is a quick and easy way to help them out. Even if we’re\nnot in the same place. Parents can send their kids helpful advice even if they are hundreds of miles\naway. Passing along useful things also strengthens social bonds. If we know our friends are into\ncooking, sending them a new recipe we found brings us closer together. Our friends see we know and\ncare about them, we feel good for being helpful, and the sharing cements our friendship.\nIf Social Currency is about information senders and how sharing makes them look, Practical Value\nis mostly about the information receiver. It’s about saving people time or money, or helping them\nhave good experiences. Sure, sharing useful things benefits the sharer as well. Helping others feels\ngood. It even reflects positively on the sharer, providing a bit of Social Currency. But at its core,\nsharing practical value is about helping others. The Emotions chapter noted that when we care, we\nshare. But the opposite is also true. Sharing is caring.\nYou can think about sharing practical value as akin to advice. People talk about which retirement\nplan is cheapest and which politician will balance the budget. Which medicine cures a cold and\nwhich vegetable has the most beta carotene. Think about the last time you made a decision that\nrequired you to gather and sift through large amounts of information. You probably asked one or more\npeople what you should do. And they probably either shared their opinion or sent you a link to a\nwebsite that helped you out.\nSo what makes something seem practically valuable enough to pass along?\nSAVING A COUPLE OF BUCKS\nWhen most people think about practical value, saving money is one of the first things that comes to\nmind—getting something for less than its original price or getting more of something than you usually\nwould for the same price.\nWebsites like Groupon and LivingSocial have built business models around offering consumers\ndiscounts on everything from pedicures to pilot lessons.\nOne of the biggest drivers of whether people share promotional offers is whether the offer seems\nlike a good deal. If we see an amazing deal we can’t help but talk about it or pass it on to someone\nwe think would find it useful. If the offer is just okay, though, we keep it to ourselves.\nSo what determines whether or not a promotional offer seems like a good deal?\nNot surprisingly, the size of the discount influences how good a deal seems. Saving a hundred\ndollars, for example, tends to be more exciting than saving one dollar. Saving 50 percent is more\nexciting than saving 10 percent. You don’t have to be a brain surgeon to realize that people like (and\nshare) bigger discounts more than smaller ones.\nBut it’s actually more complicated than that. Consider what you would do in the following\nexample:\nScenario A: Imagine you’re at a store looking to buy a new barbecue grill. You find a Weber Q\n320 grill that looks pretty good, and to your delight it’s also on sale. Originally priced at $350, it\nis now marked down to $250.\nWould you buy this barbecue grill or drive to another store to look at others? Take a second to\nthink about your answer. Got it? Okay, let’s do the exercise again for a different retailer.\nScenario B: Imagine you’re at a store looking to buy a new barbecue grill. You find a Weber Q\n320 grill that looks pretty good and to your delight it’s also on sale. Originally priced at $255, it\nis now marked down to $240.\nWhat would you do in this case? Would you buy this barbecue grill or drive to another store to\nlook at others? Wait until you have an answer and then read on.\nIf you’re like most people, scenario A looked pretty good. One hundred dollars off a barbecue grill\nand it’s a model you like? Seems like a good deal. You probably said you’d buy it rather than keep\nlooking.\nScenario B, however, probably didn’t look so good. After all, it’s only fifteen dollars off, nowhere\nnear as good as the first deal. You probably said you’d keep looking rather than buy that one.\nI found similar results when I gave each scenario to one hundred different people. While 75\npercent of the people who received scenario A said they’d buy the grill rather than keep looking, only\n22 percent of people who received scenario B said they’d buy the grill.\nThis all makes perfect sense—until you think about the final price at each store. Both stores were\nselling the same grill. So if anything, people should have been more likely to say they would buy it at\nthe store where the price was lower (scenario B). But they weren’t. In fact, the opposite happened.\nMore people said they would purchase the grill in scenario A, even though they would have had to\npay a higher price ($250 rather than $240) to get it. What gives?\nTHE PSYCHOLOGY OF DEALS\nOn a cold, wintry day in December 2002, Daniel Kahneman walked onstage to address a packed\nlecture hall at Sweden’s Stockholm University. The audience was filled with Swedish diplomats,\ndignitaries, and some of the world’s most prominent academics. Kahneman was there to give a talk on\nbounded rationality, a new perspective on intuitive judgment and choice. He had given related talks\nover the years, but this one was slightly different. Kahneman was in Stockholm to accept the Nobel\nPrize in Economics.\nThe Nobel Prize is one of the world’s most prestigious awards and is given to researchers who\nhave contributed great insight to their disciplines. Albert Einstein received a Nobel Prize for his\nwork on theoretical physics. Watson and Crick received a Nobel in medicine for their work on the\nstructure of DNA. In economics, the Nobel Prize is awarded to a person whose research has had a\nlarge impact on advancing economic thinking.\nBut Kahneman isn’t an economist. He is a psychologist.\nKahneman received the Nobel for his work with Amos Tversky on what they called “prospect\ntheory.” The theory is amazingly rich, but at its core, it’s based on a very basic idea. The way people\nactually make decisions often violates standard economic assumptions about how they should make\ndecisions. Judgments and decisions are not always rational or optimal. Instead, they are based on\npsychological principles of how people perceive and process information. Just as perceptual\nprocesses influence whether we see a particular sweater as red or view an object on the horizon as\nfar away, they also influence whether a price seems high or a deal seems good. Along with Richard\nThaler’s work, Kahneman and Tversky’s research is some of the earliest studying what we now think\nof as “behavioral economics.”\n—————\nOne of the main tenets of prospect theory is that people don’t evaluate things in absolute terms.\nThey evaluate them relative to a comparison standard, or “reference point.” Fifty cents for coffee\nisn’t just fifty cents for coffee. Whether that seems like a fair price or not depends on your\nexpectations. If you live in New York City, paying fifty cents for a cup of coffee seems pretty cheap.\nYou’d chuckle at your good luck and buy coffee from that place every day. You might even tell your\nfriends.\nIf you live in rural India, though, fifty cents might seem hugely expensive. It would be way more\nthan you would dream of paying for coffee and you’d never buy it. If you told your friends anything it\nwould be your outrage at the price gouging.\nYou see the same phenomenon at work if you go to the movies or the store with people in their\nseventies or eighties. They often complain about the prices. “What?” they exclaim. “No way am I\npaying eleven dollars for a movie ticket. That’s such a rip-off!”\nIt might seem that old people are stingier than the rest of us. But there is a more fundamental reason\nthat they think the prices are unfair. They have different reference points. They remember the days\nwhen a movie ticket was forty cents and steak was ninety-five cents a pound, when toothpaste was\ntwenty-nine cents and paper towels cost a dime. Because of that, it’s hard for them to see today’s\nprices as fair. The prices seem so much higher than what they remember, so they balk at paying them.\nReference points help explain the barbecue grill scenarios we discussed a few pages ago. People\nuse the price they expect to pay for something as their reference point. So the grill seemed like a\nbetter deal when it was marked down from $350 to $250 rather than when it was discounted from\n$255 to $240, even though it was the same grill. Setting a higher reference point made the first deal\nseem better even though the price was higher overall.\nInfomercials often use the same approach.\nThe amazing Miracle Blade knives last forever! Watch them slice through a pineapple, soda\ncan, or even a penny! You might expect to pay $100 or even $200 for a set of knives like these,\nbut right now you can get this incredible knife set for only $39.99!\nSound familiar? It should. Most infomercials use this technique to make whatever they are offering\nseem like a great deal. By mentioning $100 or $200 as the price you might expect to pay, the\ninfomercial sets a high reference point, making the final price of $39.99 seem like a steal.\nThis is also why retailers often list a “regular” or manufacturer’s standard retail price even when\nsomething is on sale. They want consumers to use those prices as the reference price, making the sale\nprice look even better. Consumers are so focused on getting a good deal that, as the barbecue grill\nexample showed, they sometimes even end up paying more to get it.\nReference points also work with quantities.\nBut wait, there’s more! If you call now, we’ll throw in a second set of these knives absolutely\nfree! That’s right, an extra set for the same price. And we’ll even throw in this handy knife\nsharpener. No extra charge!\nHere the infomercial is taking the reference quantity and augmenting it. You expected to pay $39.99\nfor one set of Miracle Blade knives, but now you are getting an extra set, and a knife sharpener, for\nthe same price. In addition to the price being lower than your expectations (which was set by them in\nthe first place), the additional goods makes the offer seem like an even better deal.\n—————\nHow far will the effect of putting something on sale go? Marketing scientists Eric Anderson and\nDuncan Simester wanted to find out. So a few years ago they paired up with a company that sends\nclothing catalogs to homes across the United States. Think L.L. Bean, Spiegel, or Lands’ End. Most of\nthe clothes in these catalogs are full price, but sometimes the catalog features certain sale items and\ndrops its prices. Not surprisingly, this increases sales. People like to pay less, so dropping the price\nmakes things more desirable.\nBut Anderson and Simester had a different question in mind. They wondered whether consumers\nfind the idea of a discount so powerful that merely labeling something as “on sale” would increase\npurchase.\nTo test this possibility, Anderson and Simester created two different versions of the catalog and\nmailed each to more than fifty thousand people. In one version some of the products (let’s call them\ndresses) were marked with signs that said “Pre-Season SALE.” In the other version the dresses were\nnot marked as on sale.\nSure enough, marking those items as on sale increased demand. By more than 50 percent.\nThe kicker?\nThe prices of the dresses were the same in both versions of the catalog. So using the word “sale”\nbeside a price increased sales even though the price itself stayed the same.\n—————\nAnother tenet of prospect theory is something called “diminishing sensitivity.” Imagine you are\nlooking to buy a new clock radio. At the store where you expect to buy it, you find that the price is\n$35. A clerk informs you that the same item is available at another branch of the same store for only\n$25. The store is a twenty-minute drive away and the clerk assures you that they have what you want\nthere.\nWhat would you do? Would you buy the clock radio at the first store or drive to the second store?\nIf you’re like most people, you’re probably willing to go to the other store. After all, it’s only a\nshort drive away and you save almost 30 percent on the radio. It seems like a no-brainer.\nBut consider a similar example. Imagine you are buying a new television. At the store where you\nexpect to buy it, you find that the price is $650. A clerk informs you that the same item is available at\nanother branch of the same store for only $640. The store is a twenty-minute drive away and the clerk\nassures you that they have what you want there.\nWhat would you do in this situation? Would you be willing to drive twenty minutes to save $10 on\nthe television?\nIf you’re like most people, this time around you probably said no. Why drive twenty minutes to\nsave a few bucks on a TV? You’d probably spend more on gas than what you’d save on the product.\nIn fact, when I gave each scenario to one hundred different people, 87 percent said they’d buy the\ntelevision at the first store while only 17 percent said the same for the clock radio.\nBut if you think about it, these two scenarios are essentially the same. They’re both about driving\ntwenty minutes to save $10. So people should have been equally willing to take the drive in each\nscenario.\nExcept they weren’t. While almost everyone is willing to endure the drive for the cheaper clock\nradio, almost no one is willing to do it when buying a TV. Why?\nDiminishing sensitivity reflects the idea that the same change has a smaller impact the farther it is\nfrom the reference point. Imagine that you enter a lottery at your office or your child’s school. You’re\nnot expecting to get much out of it, but to your surprise you win $10. Lucky you! Winning anything is\ngreat, so you’d probably be pretty happy about it.\nNow imagine you won $20 instead. You’d probably feel even happier. Maybe you wouldn’t be\ndoing backflips in either case, but winning $20 would feel significantly better than winning only $10.\nOkay, now let’s take that same lottery and that same $10 increase in winnings and let’s raise the\nstakes a little. Imagine you won $120 rather than $110. Or even better, $1,020 rather than $1,010.\nSuddenly that extra $10 wouldn’t matter as much. You’d probably feel essentially the same if you\nwon $120 rather than $110. If you won $1,020 rather than $1,010 you probably wouldn’t even notice.\nThe same change—gaining ten more dollars—has a smaller and smaller impact the farther you move\nfrom your reference point of zero dollars or not winning anything.\nDiminishing sensitivity helps explain why people are more willing to drive to save the money on\nthe clock radio. The clock radio was much cheaper, so a discount from $35 to $25 seems like a pretty\ngood deal. But even though the television is also $10 off, it doesn’t seem like a bargain given how\nmuch more expensive the television was in the first place.\nHIGHLIGHTING INCREDIBLE VALUE\nDeals seem more appealing when they highlight incredible value. As discussed in the Social\nCurrency chapter, the more remarkable something is, the more likely it will be discussed. We’re\nbombarded with deals all the time. If we shared every time the grocery store knocked ten cents off a\ncan of soup no one would be friends with us anymore. A deal needs to cut through the clutter to get\nshared.\nAs prospect theory illustrates, one key factor in highlighting incredible value is what people\nexpect. Promotional offers that seem surprising or surpass expectations are more likely to be shared.\nThis can be because the actual deal itself exceeds expectations (for example, the percentage off is so\nunbelievable) or because the way the deal is framed makes it seem that way.\nAnother factor that affects whether deals seem valuable is their availability. Somewhat\ncounterintuitively, making promotions more restrictive can actually make them more effective. Just as\nin the examples of Please Don’t Tell and Rue La La that we discussed in the Social Currency chapter,\nrestricting availability through scarcity and exclusivity makes things seem more valuable.\nTake timing or frequency. Putting something on sale can make it seem like a good deal. But if a\nproduct is always on sale people start to adjust their expectations. Rather than the full, “regular”\nprice being their reference point, the sale price becomes the expected price. This happens with rug\nstores that always offer 70 percent off. People come to realize that “sales” are the norm and no longer\nsee them as deals. The same is true even with the word “sale.” While noting something is on sale can\nincrease demand, if too many items in a store are listed as being on sale, it can actually reduce\npurchase.\nBut offers that are available for only a limited time seem more appealing because of the restriction.\nJust like making a product scarce, the fact that a deal won’t be around forever makes people feel that\nit must be a really good one.\nQuantity limits work the same way. Retailers sometimes create limits around the number of a given\ndiscounted item a given customer can buy. “One per household” or “Limit three per customer.” You\nmight think that by making it harder for people to get as many as they want these restrictions would\nhurt demand. But they actually have the opposite effect by making the promotion seem like an even\nbetter deal. “Wow, if I can only get one of these, it must mean that the deal is so good that the store is\nworried about running out of them. Better get one fast!” Indeed, research finds that quantity purchase\nlimits increase sales by more than 50 percent.\nEven restricting who has access can make a promotional offer seem better. Some deals are\navailable to everyone. Anyone can walk up to the discount rack at the Gap and get money off chinos,\njust as any patron can take advantage of happy hour at his or her local pub. But other deals are\ncustomized, or restricted to a certain set of customers. Hotels reward loyal members with “exclusive”\nhotel rates and restaurants have “soft openings” for a certain clientele.\nThese offers seem special. This boosts sharing not only by increasing Social Currency, but also by\nmaking the deal itself seem better. Like restrictions on quantity or timing, the mere fact that not\neveryone can get access to this promotion makes it seem more valuable. This increases Practical\nValue, which in turn, boosts sharing.\nThe Rule of 100\nAnother framing factor that impacts practical value is how promotional offers are expressed. Some\noffers are expressed in dollars off, or absolute discounts ($5 or $50 off). Other offers are expressed\nin percentage off, or relative discounts (5 percent or 50 percent off). Could whether a promotion is\nframed as money or as a percentage off affect how big the discount seems?\nTake twenty percent off a $25 shirt. The same reduction can be represented as 20 percent off or $5\noff. Which seems like a better deal?\nOr think about a $2,000 laptop. The same reduction on a $2,000 laptop can be represented as 10\npercent off or $200 off. Does one method of framing the discount make the deal seem better than the\nother?\nResearchers find that whether a discount seems larger as money or percentage off depends on the\noriginal price. For low-priced products, like books or groceries, price reductions seem more\nsignificant when they are framed in percentage terms. Twenty percent off that $25 shirt seems like a\nbetter deal than $5 off. For high-priced products, however, the opposite is true. For things like\nlaptops or other big-ticket items, framing price reductions in dollar terms (rather than percentage\nterms) makes them seem like a better offer. The laptop seems like a better deal when it is $200 off\nrather than 10 percent off.\nA simple way to figure out which discount frame seems larger is by using something called the\nRule of 100.\nIf the product’s price is less than $100, the Rule of 100 says that percentage discounts will seem\nlarger. For a $30 T-shirt or a $15 entrée, even a $3 discount is still a relatively small number. But\npercentagewise (10 percent or 20 percent), that same discount looks much bigger.\nIf the product’s price is more than $100, the opposite is true. Numerical discounts will seem\nlarger. Take a $750 vacation package or the $2,000 laptop. While a 10 percent discount may seem\nlike a relatively small number, it immediately seems much bigger when translated into dollars ($75 or\n$200).\nSo when deciding how good a promotional offer really is, or how to frame a promotional offer to\nmake it better, use the Rule of 100. Think about where the price falls relative to $100 and how that\nshifts whether absolute or relative discounts seem more attractive.\n—————\nOne last point about promotional offers is that the practical value is more effective the easier it is\nfor people to see. Take the shopper discount cards that you get at your local grocery store or\npharmacy. These cards are certainly useful. They save consumers money and sometimes even give\nthem free gifts if they have accumulated enough purchases. But one problem is that the practical value\nis not very visible. The only information people get about how much they saved is hidden among a\nhalf dozen other pieces of information on a lengthy receipt. And given that most people don’t show\ntheir receipts to others, it’s unlikely that anyone but the person who used the card will see how much\nthey saved. That makes it less likely that the information will be contagious.\nBut what if stores made the practical value easier to see? They could put up a sign at checkout that\nshows other people in line how much the person checking out saved. Or the store might ring a bell\nevery time someone saved more than twenty-five dollars. This would make two things happen. First,\npeople would get a better sense of how much they could save by getting the card, encouraging anyone\nwho doesn’t have one yet to get one. Second, it would allow people to see the impressive amounts\nthat some other shoppers were able to save, encouraging them to transmit these remarkable stories of\npractical value. As discussed in the Public chapter, it’s hard to talk about something you can’t see.\nMORE THAN MONEY\nI am terrible at investing. Too many options, too much daily volatility, and too much risk. I’d rather\nkeep my money in a cardboard box under my bed than put it in some mutual fund that could lose\nmoney. The first time I bought stocks I barely dipped my toe in. I picked two or three that seemed like\ngood long-term investments based on being strong brands and tried to leave it at that.\nBut my curiosity got the best of me. I frantically checked every day how each stock was doing. A\ndollar up today? Huge success! Thirty-five cents down the next day? Hopelessly despondent and\nconsidering giving up investing ever again.\nNeedless to say I needed help. So when it came time to put money in my 401(k) for work, I picked\nsome safe index funds that track the stock market.\nSoon after, Vanguard, the firm that manages my retirement plan, sent me a short e-mail asking if I’d\nlike to receive its monthly newsletter, MoneyWhys. Like most people, I try to avoid signing up for\nnew mailing lists, but this one actually seemed useful. Last-minute tax tips, responses to common\nquestions about investing, and an answer (or at least an opinion) on that age-old question of whether\nmoney can really buy happiness. I signed up.\nNow, once a month, Vanguard sends me a short e-mail with useful information about financial\nmanagement. One month it was tips on what homeowner’s insurance actually covers. Another month it\nprovided tips on using your PC to track personal finances.\nTo be honest, I don’t read every e-mail Vanguard sends (sorry, Vanguard), but I end up forwarding\nmany of the ones I do read to people I know who I think will find them useful. I sent the piece about\nhomeowner’s insurance to a colleague who just bought a home. I forwarded the piece about tracking\npersonal finances to a friend who is trying to become more fiscally responsible. Vanguard nicely\npackages its expertise into a short, tight bundle of useful information, and the practical value made me\npass it along. And along the way I’m spreading the word about Vanguard and its investment expertise.\n—————\nUseful information, then, is another form of practical value. Helping people do things they want to\ndo, or encouraging them to do things they should do. Faster, better, and easier.\nAs we discussed in the Emotions chapter, our analysis of The New York Times Most E-Mailed list\nfound that articles about health and education were some of the most frequently shared. Recipes and\nreviews of up-and-coming restaurants were also highly shared. One reason is that these types of\narticles all provide useful information. The health section suggests solutions for people with hearing\nloss and techniques for boosting mental fitness in middle age. The education section covers useful\nprograms for teens and provides insight into the college admissions process. Sharing this type of\ncontent with others enables them to eat, live, and learn better.\nLook at the content you’ve been e-mailed over the past few months and you’ll see similar patterns.\nArticles about sunscreen brands that Consumer Reports rated the best, tips to recover quickly from\nexercise, or hints for great pumpkin carving design around Halloween. All these things are useful.\nPractical advice is shareable advice.\nIn thinking about why some useful content gets shared more, a couple of points are worth noting.\nThe first is how the information is packaged. Vanguard doesn’t send out a rambling four-page e-mail\nwith twenty-five advice links about fifteen different topics. It sends out a short, one-page note, with a\nkey header article and three or four main links below it. It’s easy to see what the main points are, and\nif you want to find out more, you can simply click on the links. Many of the most viral articles on The\nNew York Times and other websites have a similar structure. Five ways to lose weight. Ten dating\ntips for the New Year. The next time you’re waiting in the checkout line at the grocery store, take a\nlook at the magazines and you’ll see the same idea being applied. Short lists focused around a key\ntopic.\nA cosmetic manufacturer makes a helpful iPhone application for business travelers. In addition to\nproviding local weather information, it also provides expert skin care advice that is tailored to those\nlocal conditions. Humidity, rain, and air quality affect your hair and skin, so the application tells you\nthe right way to respond. This practically valuable information not only is useful, but also\ndemonstrates the company’s knowledge and expertise in this domain.\nThe second key is the audience. Some stories or information have a broader audience than others.\nIn the United States, at least, more people follow professional football than follow water polo.\nSimilarly, you probably have more friends that like American restaurants than like Ethiopian\nrestaurants.\nYou might think that content that has a broader audience is more likely to be shared. A piece about\nfootball should be shared more than one about water polo; a review about a new American restaurant\nshould be passed on more than a review of a new Ethiopian place. After all, people have way more\nfriends with whom they could share the article, so shouldn’t it end up reaching more people overall?\nThe problem with this assumption, though, is that just because people can share with more people\ndoesn’t mean they will. In fact, narrower content may actually be more likely to be shared because it\nreminds people of a specific friend or family member and makes them feel compelled to pass it along.\nYou might have a lot of friends who like American food or football. But because so many people are\ninterested in that type of thing, no one person strongly comes to mind when you come across related\ncontent. In contrast, you may have only one friend who cares about Ethiopian restaurants or water\npolo, but if you read an article about those topics you think about your friend right away. And because\nit seems so uniquely perfect for her, you feel you have to share it.\nSo while broadly relevant content could be shared more, content that is obviously relevant to a\nnarrow audience may actually be more viral.\nA NOTE ON TRUTH\nYou may have heard that vaccines cause autism. If so, you’re not alone. In 1998, a paper was\npublished in a medical journal suggesting that an immunization against measles, mumps, and rubella\ncould cause autism in children. Health-related news spreads fast, particularly when it relates to kids,\nand soon lots of people were talking about the potential downsides to vaccines. As a result,\nchildhood vaccination rates decreased.\nAll this would be good if the link between vaccines and autism were true. But it’s not. There is no\nscientific evidence that vaccines cause autism. The original paper turned out to be a fraud. The doctor\nwho authored it had manipulated evidence, apparently owing to conflict of interest, and after being\nfound guilty of serious professional misconduct, lost his medical license. But even though the\ninformation was false, lots of people shared it.\nThe reason is practical value. People weren’t trying to share false things, they just heard something\nthey thought was useful and they wanted others’ kids to be safe. But many people didn’t hear the news\nthat the original report had been discredited, and so they continued to share an incorrect narrative.\nOur desire to share helpful things is so powerful that it can make even false ideas succeed.\nSometimes the drive to help takes a wrong turn.\nSo the next time someone tells you about a miracle cure, or warns about the health risks of a\nparticular food or behavior, try to verify that information independently before you pass it on. False\ninformation can spread just as quickly as the truth.\n—————\nPractical value is about helping. This chapter discussed the mechanics of value and the psychology\nof deals, but it’s important to remember why people share that type of information in the first place.\nPeople like to help one another. We go out of our way to give advice or send others information that\nwill make them better off. Sure, some of this may be selfish. We think we’re right and we can’t help\nbut toss our two cents into other people’s lives. But not all of it is about us. It’s also about altruism,\nthe inherent goodness of people. We care about others and we want to make their lives better.\nOf the six principles of contagiousness that we discuss in the book, Practical Value may be the\neasiest to apply.\nSome products and ideas already have lots of Social Currency, but to build it into a video for a\nblender takes some energy and creativity. Figuring out how to create Triggers also requires some\neffort, as does evoking emotion. But finding Practical Value isn’t hard. Almost every product or idea\nimaginable has something useful about it. Whether it saves people money, makes them happier,\nimproves health, or saves them time, all of these things are news you can use. So thinking about why\npeople gravitate to our product or idea in the first place will give us a good sense of the underlying\npractical value.\nThe harder part is cutting through the clutter. There are lots of good restaurants and helpful\nwebsites, so we need to make our product or idea stand out. We need to highlight incredible value\nand use the Rule of 100. Like Vanguard, we need to package our knowledge and expertise so that\npeople learn about us while they pass it along. We need to make it clear why our product or idea is so\nuseful that people just have to spread the word. News you can use.\n6. Stories\nThe war had raged for ten long years, with no finish in sight. According to legend, Odysseus\ndevised a cunning plan to end the fruitless siege. The Greeks built a giant wooden horse and hid their\nbest warriors inside. The rest of their army then sailed away, pretending to return to their homeland\nand leaving the monumental horse behind on the beach.\nThe Trojans found the horse and dragged it into Troy as a symbol of their victory. They tied ropes\naround the beast’s neck and dozens of men set huge log rollers underneath the wooden body to pull it\nslowly up from the beach. Others worked to take down the gate so that the monstrous sculpture could\nbe dragged inside the city walls.\nOnce the statue was inside, the Trojans celebrated the end of the decade-long conflict. They\ndecorated the temples with greenery, unearthed the jugs of sacrificial wine, and danced to rejoice at\nthe conclusion of their ordeal.\nBut that night, while the city lay unconscious in drunken slumber, the Greeks sprang from their\nhiding place. They slid to the ground, silenced the sentries, and opened the huge gates to the city. The\nrest of the Greek army sailed back under the cover of darkness and soon joined them, easily walking\nthrough the very gates they had fruitlessly assaulted for so many years.\nThe city was able to stand a decade of battle, but it could not withstand an attack from within. Once\ninside, the Greeks destroyed the town, decisively ending the Trojan War.\n—————\nThe story of the Trojan Horse has been passed on for thousands of years. Scientists and historians\nestimate that the battle took place around 1170 BC, but the story was not written down until many\nyears later. For centuries the tale was transmitted orally as an epic poem, spoken or sung to music.\nThe story reads like a modern-day reality show. It’s full of twists and turns that include personal\nvendettas, adultery, and double crosses. Through a potent mixture of drama, romance, and action, it\nholds listeners’ interest.\nBut the story of the Trojan Horse also carries an underlying message: “Beware of Greeks bearing\ngifts.” A more general interpretation would be “never trust your enemies, even when they seem\nfriendly.” In fact it is exactly when they are making such overtures that you should be especially\nsuspicious. So the tale of the Trojan Horse is more than just an entertaining story. It also teaches an\nimportant lesson.\nStill, if Homer and Virgil had simply wanted to teach people a lesson, couldn’t they have done it\nmore efficiently? Couldn’t they have gotten right to the point rather than writing an epic poem with\nhundreds of lines of poetry?\nOf course. But would the lesson have had the same impact? Probably not.\nBy encasing the lesson in a story, these early writers ensured that it would be passed along—and\nperhaps even be believed more wholeheartedly than if the lesson’s words were spoken simply and\nplainly. That’s because people don’t think in terms of information. They think in terms of narratives.\nBut while people focus on the story itself, information comes along for the ride.\nSTORIES AS VESSELS\nStories are the original form of entertainment. Imagine you were a Greek citizen in 1000 BC. There\nwas no Internet. No SportsCenter or six o’clock news. No radio or newspapers. So if you wanted\nentertainment, stories were the way to get it. The Trojan Horse, The Odyssey, and other famous tales\nwere the entertainment of the day. People would gather round a fire, or sit in an amphitheater, to hear\nthese epic narratives told again and again.\nNarratives are inherently more engrossing than basic facts. They have a beginning, middle, and\nend. If people get sucked in early, they’ll stay for the conclusion. When you hear people tell a good\nstory you hang on every word. You want to find out whether they missed the plane or what they did\nwith a house full of screaming nine year olds. You started down a path and you want to know how it\nends. Until it does, they’ve captured your attention.\nToday there are thousands of entertainment options, but our tendency to tell stories remains. We get\ntogether around our proverbial campfires—now water coolers or girls’/guys’ night out—and tell\nstories. About ourselves and the things that have happened to us lately. About our friends and other\npeople we know.\nPeople tell stories for the same reasons they share word of mouth. Some narratives are about\nSocial Currency. People tell the story of going through the phone booth to get into Please Don’t Tell\nbecause it makes them look cool and in the know. Other stories are driven by (high arousal) Emotion.\nPeople tell the story of Will It Blend? because they are amazed that a blender could shred marbles or\nan iPhone. Practical Value also plays a role. People share the story of how their neighbor’s dogs got\nsick after eating a certain type of chew toy because they want your dog to avoid the same fate.\nPeople are so used to telling stories that they create narratives even when they don’t actually need\nto. Take online reviews. They’re supposed to be about product features. How well a new digital\ncamera worked and whether the zoom is as good as the company suggests. But this mostly\ninformational content often ends up being embedded in a background narrative.\nMy son just turned eight so we were planning our first trip to Disney World last July. We\nneeded a digital camera to capture the experience so bought this one because my friend\nrecommended it. The zoom was great. We could easily get sharp pictures of Cinderella’s\nCastle even from far away.\nWe’re so used to telling stories that we do it even when a simple rating or opinion would have\nsufficed.\n—————\nJust like the Trojan Horse itself, stories are more than they seem. Sure, the outward shell of a story\n—we could call this the surface plot—grabs your attention and engages your interest. But peel back\nthat exterior, and you’ll usually find something hidden inside. Underneath the star-crossed lovers and\nthundering heroes there is usually something else being conveyed.\nStories carry things. A lesson or moral. Information or a take-home message. Take the famous story\n“The Three Little Pigs.” Three brothers leave home to head into the world to seek their fortune. The\nfirst little pig quickly builds his house out of straw. The second pig uses sticks. Both throw their\nhouses together as quickly as possible so they can hang out and play the rest of the day. The third pig,\nhowever, is more disciplined. He takes the time and effort to carefully build his house out of bricks,\neven while his brothers have fun around him.\nOne night, a big bad wolf comes along looking for something to eat. He goes to the first pig’s house\nand says those words so beloved by small children: “Little pig, little pig, let me in.” But when the pig\nsays no, the wolf blows the pig’s house down. He does the same to the house of sticks. But when the\nwolf tries the same thing at the third pig’s house, it doesn’t work. He huffs and he puffs but the wolf\ncan’t destroy the third pig’s house because it’s made of bricks.\nAnd that’s the moral of the story. Effort pays off. Take the time to do something right. You might not\nhave as much fun right away, but you’ll find that it’s worth it in the end.\nLessons or morals are also embedded in thousands of other fairy tales, fables, and urban legends.\n“The Boy Who Cried Wolf” warns about the dangers of lying. “Cinderella” shows that being good to\nothers pays off. Shakespeare’s plays carry valuable lessons about character and relationships, power\nand madness, love and war. These are complex lessons, but they are instructive nevertheless.\n—————\nThe ordinary stories we tell one another every day also carry information.\nTake the story of the coat my cousin bought from Lands’ End. He’d moved from California to the\nEast Coast a couple of years ago, and in preparation for his first real winter he went to a fancy\ndepartment store and bought a nice topcoat. The coat was one of those three-quarter-length wool\nvarieties that men often wear over suits. It fitted well, the color was perfect, and my cousin felt like a\ndapper English gentleman.\nThere was only one problem. It wasn’t warm enough. It was great when the temperature outside\nwas in the fifties and even the forties, but once the temperature got down to the thirties the cold\nseeped right through the coat into my cousin’s bones.\nAfter one winter of looking great but freezing every day on his way to work, he decided it was time\nto get a real winter coat. He even decided to go whole hog and get one of those goose-down numbers\nthat make you look as if you’re wearing a sleeping bag—the kind of coat that is ubiquitous in the East\nand Midwest but never seen in California. So he went online, found a great deal at Lands’ End, and\nbought a down commuter coat rated to minus thirty degrees Fahrenheit. Warm enough to withstand\neven the coldest East Coast winter.\nMy cousin really liked the coat, and indeed it was super warm. But halfway through the season he\nbroke the zipper. Ripped it right off the lining. He was devastated. He had just bought the coat a few\nmonths before and it was broken already. How much would it cost to have it fixed? And how long\nwould he have to wait to get it back from being repaired?\nIt was mid-January, not a very ideal time to be walking around without a winter coat.\nSo he called Lands’ End. How much will it cost to repair, he asked, and how long will it take to be\nfixed?\nMy cousin braced for the icy reply he was used to getting from customer service people. It always\nseems to be the customer’s problem. So sorry to hear the product broke or the service isn’t working,\ncustomer service people usually say, but unfortunately it’s not our fault. It’s outside the warranty or\nyou tried to do something beyond the normal use. But we’d be happy to repair it for twice the cost of\nthe product or send someone out to check on it. Just as long as you can stay home from work for the\nthree-hour window during which we may or may not show up. Oh, and by the way, the script the\nbrand consultants wrote reminds us to tell you that we really appreciate your business.\nBut to his surprise, the Lands’ End customer service person said something entirely different.\n“Repair?” she asked. “We’ll just send you a new one in the mail.” “How much will that cost?” my\ncousin asked nervously. “It’s free,” she replied, “and we’ll send it out two-day mail so you don’t\nhave to wait. It’s too cold this winter to go out with a broken coat.”\nA free replacement sent right away if a product breaks? Wow! That’s almost unheard of in this day\nand age of “the customer is always wrong.” Remarkable customer service. Customer service the way\nit is supposed to be. My cousin was so impressed he just had to tell me what happened.\nMy cousin’s experience makes for a nice story, but when you look closer there is also a huge\namount of useful information hidden in the narrative: (1) Topcoats look great but aren’t really warm\nenough for a bitter East Coast winter. (2) Down coats make you look like a mummy, but they’re worth\ngetting if you want to stay warm. (3) Lands’ End makes a really warm winter coat. (4) It also has\noutstanding customer service. (5) If something goes wrong, Lands’ End will fix it. These are just a\nhandful of the nuggets of knowledge woven into a deceptively simple story.\nThe same is true for most stories people tell us. How we avoided the traffic jam or how the dry\ncleaner was able to take our oil-splattered white shirt and make it look like new. These stories\ncontain helpful information: a good route to take if the highway is blocked; a great dry cleaner if you\nneed to get out tough stains.\nStories, then, can act as vessels, carriers that help transmit information to others.\nLEARNING THROUGH STORIES\nStories are an important source of cultural learning that help us make sense of the world. At a high\nlevel, this learning can be about the rules and standards of a group or society. How should a good\nemployee behave? What does it mean to be a moral person? Or on a more basic level: who’s a good\nmechanic who won’t overcharge?\nBeyond stories, think about other ways that people could acquire this information. Trial and error\nmight work, but it would be extremely costly and time-consuming. Imagine if finding an honest\nmechanic required taking your car to two dozen different places around town and getting work done at\neach one. It would be exhausting (and expensive).\nAlternatively, people could try direct observation, but that’s also tough. You’d have to cozy up to\nthe mechanics in all the different shops and convince them to let you watch what they did and tell you\nhow much they charged. Guess how well that would work.\nFinally, people could get their information from advertisements. But ads aren’t always trustworthy,\nand people are generally skeptical of persuasion attempts. Most ads for mechanics will say they have\ngreat prices and do good work, but without really checking, it’s hard to know for sure.\nStories solve this problem. They provide a quick and easy way for people to acquire lots of\nknowledge in a vivid and engaging fashion. One good story about a mechanic who fixed the problem\nwithout charging is worth dozens of observations and years of trial and error. Stories save time and\nhassle and give people the information they need in a way that’s easy to remember.\nYou can think of stories as providing proof by analogy. There is no way to be sure that if I buy\nsomething from Lands’ End, I’ll get the same wonderful customer service my cousin received. But the\nmere fact that it happened to someone who is like me makes me feel that there is a pretty good chance\nit will happen to me too.\nPeople are also less likely to argue against stories than against advertising claims. Lands’ End\nrepresentatives could tell us that they have great customer service, but as we discussed earlier, the\nfact that they are trying to sell something makes it difficult to believe them. It’s harder to argue with\npersonal stories.\nFirst, it’s hard to disagree with a specific thing that happened to a specific person. What is\nsomeone going to tell my cousin, “No, I think you’re lying, there’s no way Lands’ End would be that\nnice”? Hardly.\nSecond, we’re so caught up in the drama of what happened to so-and-so that we don’t have the\ncognitive resources to disagree. We’re so engaged in following the narrative that we don’t have the\nenergy to question what is being said. So in the end, we’re much more likely to be persuaded.\n—————\nPeople don’t like to seem like walking advertisements. The Subway sandwich chain offers seven\nsubs with less than six grams of fat. But no one is going to walk up to a friend and just spit out that\ninformation. Not only would it be weird, it would be out of context. Sure, this information is\npractically valuable if someone is trying to lose weight, but unless weight loss is the topic of\nconversation, or the situation triggers people to think about ways to lose weight, they’re not going to\nbring it up. So the fact that Subway has a bunch of low-fat options may not be brought up that often.\nContrast that with the Jared story. Jared Fogle lost 245 pounds eating Subway sandwiches. Bad\neating habits and lack of exercise led Jared to balloon to 425 pounds in college. He was so heavy that\nhe picked his courses based on whether the classroom had large-enough seats for him to be\ncomfortable rather than whether he liked the material.\nBut after his roommate pointed out that his health was getting worse, Jared decided to take action.\nSo he started a “Subway diet”: almost every day he ate a foot-long veggie sub for lunch and a six-inch\nturkey sub for dinner. After three months of this self-imposed regimen he had lost almost 100 pounds.\nBut he didn’t stop there. Jared kept up his diet. Soon his pants size had dropped from an enormous\nsixty inches to a normal thirty-four-inch waist. He lost all that weight and had Subway to thank.\nThe Jared story is so entertaining that people bring it up even when they’re not talking about weight\nloss. The amount of weight he lost is impressive, but even more astonishing is the fact that he lost it\neating Subway sandwiches. A guy loses 245 pounds eating fast food? The summary alone is enough to\ndraw people in.\nThe story gets shared for many of the reasons we talked about in prior chapters. It’s remarkable\n(Social Currency), evokes surprise and amazement (Emotion), and provides useful information about\nhealthy fast food (Practical Value).\nPeople don’t talk about Jared because they want to help Subway, but Subway still benefits because\nit is part of the narrative. Listeners learn about Jared, but they also learn about Subway along the way.\nThey learn that (1) while Subway might seem like fast food, it actually offers a number of healthy\noptions. (2) So healthy that someone could lose weight by eating them. (3) A lot of weight. Further,\n(4) someone could eat mostly Subway sandwiches for three months and still come back for more. So\nthe food must be pretty tasty. Listeners learn all this about Subway, even though people tell the story\nbecause of Jared.\nAnd that is the magic of stories. Information travels under the guise of what seems like idle\nchatter.\nBUILD A TROJAN HORSE\nStories thus give people an easy way to talk about products and ideas. Subway might have low-fat\nsubs, and Lands’ End might have great customer service, but outside of triggers in a conversation,\npeople need a reason to bring that information up. And good stories provide that reason. They\nprovide a sort of psychological cover that allows people to talk about a product or idea without\nseeming like an advertisement.\nSo how can we use stories to get people talking?\nWe need to build our own Trojan Horse—a carrier narrative that people will share, while talking\nabout our product or idea along the way.\n—————\nTim Piper never had a sister. And he grew up going to an all-boys school. So he had always\nthought it was a little ridiculous that so many of his girlfriends had beauty issues. They were always\nworried that their hair was too straight, their eyes were too light, or their complexion wasn’t clear\nenough. Piper didn’t get it. They seemed pretty enough to him.\nBut after interviewing dozens of girls, Piper started to realize that the media were to blame.\nAdvertising, and the media in general, taught young women that something was wrong with them. That\nthey needed fixing. And after years of being bombarded with those messages, women started to\nbelieve them.\nWhat would help women realize that these ads were fake? That the images being shown didn’t\nreflect reality?\nOne night his girlfriend at the time was putting on makeup to go out when it hit him. He realized that\ngirls needed to be exposed to the before before the after. What models look like before the makeup\nand hair styling and retouching and Photoshop swoop in to make them “perfect.”\nSo he created a short film.\nStephanie stares into the camera and nods her head to the crew that she is ready to begin. She is\npretty, but not in a way that would make her stand out in a crowd. Her hair is dark blond, feathered,\nand relatively straight. Her skin is nice but a few blemishes mar it here and there. She looks as though\nshe could be anyone—your neighbor, your friend, your daughter.\nA bright light turns on, and the process begins. As we watch, makeup artists darken Stephanie’s\neyes and highlight her lips with gloss. They apply foundation to her skin and blush to color her\ncheeks. They groom her eyebrows and lengthen her lashes. They curl and tease and style her hair.\nThen the photographer appears with his camera. He takes dozens of photos. Fans are turned on so\nher hair appears naturally tousled. Stephanie alternately smiles and stares provocatively at the\ncamera. Finally, the photographer gets a shot he likes.\nBut getting the perfect snapshot is only the beginning. Next comes the Photoshopping. Stephanie’s\nimage is fed into a computer, and begins to morph before our eyes. Her lips are inflated. Her neck is\nthinned and lengthened. Her eyes are enlarged. These are only a handful of the dozens of changes that\nare made.\nYou are now gazing at a snapshot of a supermodel. As the camera pans backward, you can see that\nthe image has been placed on a billboard for a makeup campaign. The screen fades to black, and\nsmall words appear in white writing. “No wonder our perception of beauty is distorted.”\nWow. This is a powerful clip. A great reminder of all that really goes on behind the scenes in the\nbeauty industry.\nBut in addition to being a great conversation piece, it’s also a clever Trojan Horse for Dove\nproducts.\n—————\nThe media in general, and the beauty industry in particular, tend to paint a skewed picture of\nwomen. Models are usually tall and skinny. Magazines show women with flawless complexions and\nperfect teeth. Ads scream that their products can transform you into a better you. Younger face, fuller\nlips, softer skin.\nNot surprisingly, these messages have a hugely negative impact on how women see themselves.\nOnly 2 percent of women describe themselves as beautiful. More than two-thirds believe that the\nmedia has set an unrealistic standard of beauty that they’ll never be able to achieve. No matter how\nhard they try. This feeling of not living up to expectations even affects young girls. Dark-haired girls\nwish they were blond. Redheads hate their freckles.\nPiper’s video, entitled “Evolution,” gives a behind-the-scenes look at what goes into making the\nimages we are bombarded with every day. It reminds people that these stunning-looking women are\nnot real. They are fantasies, fictions only loosely based on actual people. Concocted using all the\nmagic that digital editing can provide. The clip is as raw and shocking as it is thought provoking.\nBut the film wasn’t sponsored by concerned citizens or an industry watchdog group. Piper made the\nfilm in coordination with Dove, maker of health and beauty products, as part of its “Campaign for\nReal Beauty.” This was Dove’s effort to celebrate the natural physical variations we all have and\nthen to inspire women to be confident and comfortable with themselves. Another ad for soap featured\nreal women of all shapes and sizes, rather than the rail-thin models people are used to seeing.\nNot surprisingly, the campaign sparked a great deal of discussion. What does it mean to be\nbeautiful? How are the media shaping these perceptions? What can we do to make it better?\nThe campaign created more than just controversy. In addition to making the issue more Public, and\ngiving people an excuse to talk about a topic that would have otherwise been private, the campaign\nalso got them thinking, and talking, about Dove.\nThe company was commended for using real people in its campaigns and for getting people to talk\nabout this complicated but important issue. And “Evolution,” which cost only a little over one\nhundred thousand dollars to make, got more than 16 million views. It netted the company hundreds of\nmillions of dollars in exposure. The clip won numerous industry awards and more than tripled the\nwebsite traffic the company received from Dove’s 2006 Super Bowl ad. Dove experienced doubledigit\nsales growth.\n“Evolution” was widely shared because Dove latched onto something people already wanted to\ntalk about: unrealistic beauty norms. It’s a highly emotional issue, but something so controversial that\npeople might have been afraid to bring up otherwise. “Evolution” brought it out in the open. It let\npeople air their grievances and think about solutions. And along the way the brand benefited. Dove\ngot people talking by starting a conversation about beauty norms—but the brand was smuggled in as\npart of the discussion. By creating an emotional story, Dove created a vessel that carried its brand\nalong for the ride.\nAnd that brings us to the story of Ron Bensimhon.\nMAKING VIRALITY VALUABLE\nOn August 16, 2004, Canadian Ron Bensimhon carefully shed his warm-up pants and stepped to the\nedge of the three-meter springboard. He had attempted dives from this height many times before, but\nnever during an event of this magnitude. It was the Athens Olympics. The world’s biggest stage for\nsport and the pinnacle of athletic competition. But Ron did not seem fazed. He shook off the jitters\nand raised his hands high above his head. As the crowd roared, he leapt off the end of the board and\ncompleted a full belly flop.\nA belly flop? In the Olympics? Surely Ron must have been devastated. But as he emerged from the\nwater he seemed calm, happy even. He swam around for a few moments, hamming it up for the\naudience and then slowly swam to the side of the pool, where he was met by a platoon of Olympic\nofficials and security guards.\nRon had broken into the Olympics. He wasn’t actually on the Canadian swim team. In fact, he\nwasn’t an Olympic athlete at all. He was the self-proclaimed most famous streaker in the world, and\nhe had crashed the Olympics as part of a publicity stunt.\n—————\nWhen Ron jumped off the springboard, he wasn’t naked, but he wasn’t wearing swim trunks either.\nHe wore a blue tutu and white polka dot tights. And emblazoned across his chest was the name of an\nInternet casino, GoldenPalace.com.\nThis wasn’t the first Golden Palace publicity stunt (though the company did say that Ron’s stunt\nwas done without its knowledge). In 2004 it bid $28,000 on eBay for a grilled cheese sandwich that\nsome people believed displayed an image of the Virgin Mary. In 2005 it gave a woman $15,000 to\nchange her name to GoldenPalace.com. But the stunt with the “fool in the pool,” as Bensimhon has\nbeen called, was one of the biggest. Millions of people were watching, and the story got picked up by\nnews outlets around the world. It also got a huge amount of word-of-mouth chatter. Someone crashing\nthe Olympics and diving into a pool in a tutu? What a story. Pretty remarkable.\nBut as the days ticked by, people didn’t talk about the casino. Sure, some people who saw\nBensimhon’s jump went to the website to try to figure out what was going on. But most people who\nshared the story talked about the stunt, not the website. They talked about whether the interruption\nthrew off the Chinese divers, who flubbed their final dive right after the trick and lost the gold medal.\nThey talked about security at the Olympics and how someone could slip through so easily at such a\nmajor event. And they talked about Bensimhon’s trial and whether he would serve jail time.\nWhat they didn’t talk about was GoldenPalace.com. Why?\n—————\nMarketing experts talk about “the fool in the pool” as one of the worst guerrilla marketing failures\nof all time. Usually they deride it for having disrupted the competition and ruining the moment for\nathletes who had trained all their lives. They also point out that it led to Bensimhon being arrested\nand fined. These are all good reasons to consider Bensimhon’s belly flop, well, a flop.\nBut I’d like to add another one to the list. The stunt had nothing to do with the product it was trying\nto promote.\nYes, people talked about the stunt, but they didn’t talk about the casino. Polka dot tights, tutus, and\nbreaking into the Olympics to dive into a pool are all great story material. That’s why people talked\nabout them. So if the goal was to get people to think more about security at the Olympics or get\nattention for a new style of tights, the stunt succeeded.\nBut it had nothing to do with casinos. Not even in the slightest.\nSo people talked about the remarkable story but left the casino out because it was irrelevant. They\nmight have mentioned that Bensimhon was sponsored by someone but didn’t mention the casino either\nbecause it was so irrelevant that they forgot, or because it didn’t make the story any better. It’s like\nbuilding a magnificent Trojan Horse but forgetting to put anything inside.\n—————\nWhen trying to generate word of mouth, many people forget one important detail. They focus so\nmuch on getting people to talk that they ignore the part that really matters: what people are talking\nabout.\nThat’s the problem with creating content that is unrelated to the product or idea it is meant to\npromote. There’s a big difference between people talking about content and people talking about the\ncompany, organization, or person that created that content.\nEvian’s famous “Roller Babies” video had the same problem. The clip shows what appear to be\ndiaper-wearing babies doing tricks on roller skates. They jump over one another, hop over fences,\nand do synchronized moves, all to the beat of the song “Rapper’s Delight.” The babies’ bodies are\nclearly animated, but their faces look real, making the video remarkable to watch. The video got more\nthan 50 million views, and Guinness World Records declared it the most viewed online\nadvertisement in history.\nBut while you might think that all this attention would benefit the brand, it didn’t. That same year\nEvian lost market share and sales dropped almost 25 percent.\nThe problem? Roller-skating babies are cute, but they have nothing to do with Evian. So people\nshared the clip, but that didn’t benefit the brand.\n—————\nThe key, then, is to not only make something viral, but also make it valuable to the sponsoring\ncompany or organization. Not just virality but valuable virality.\nTake Barclay Prime’s hundred-dollar cheesesteak that we talked about at the beginning of the book.\nCompared with dancing babies and bottled water, an expensive, high-end cheesesteak and an\nexpensive, high-end steak restaurant are clearly more related. And the item wasn’t just a stunt, it was\nan actual option on Barclay’s menu. Further, it directly spoke to the inferences the restaurant wanted\nconsumers to make about its food: high quality but not stuffy, lavish but creative.\nVirality is most valuable when the brand or product benefit is integral to the story. When it’s\nwoven so deeply into the narrative that people can’t tell the story without mentioning it.\nOne of my favorite examples of valuable virality comes from the Egyptian dairy company Panda,\nwhich makes a variety of different cheese products.\nThe commercials always start innocuously: workers talking about what to have for lunch, or a\nhospital nurse checking in on a patient. In one spot a father is grocery shopping with his son. “Dad,\nwhy don’t we get some Panda cheese?” the son asks as they walk by the dairy aisle. “Enough!” the\nfather replies. “We have enough stuff in the cart already.”\nThen the panda appears. Or rather, a man in a panda suit. There’s simply no way to describe\nadequately the ludicrousness of this moment. Yes, a giant panda is suddenly standing in the middle of\na grocery store. Or in a different commercial, an office. Or in another, a medical clinic.\nIn the grocery-store video, the father and son stare at the panda, obviously dumbfounded. As a\nBuddy Holly tune plays, the boy and his father look at the Panda cheese on the shelf, then back to the\npanda. And back and forth again. The father gulps.\nThen, pandemonium ensues (excuse the pun).\nThe panda slowly walks toward the shopping cart, calmly places both hands on its sides, and flips\nit over.\nFood flies all over the aisle—pasta, canned goods, and liquids everywhere. The stare-down\ncontinues as the father and the panda stand on opposite ends of the cart. A long pause ensues. Then the\npanda kicks the overturned food for good measure. “Never say no to Panda,” a voice intones as a\npanda hand flashes the product on the screen.\nThe commercial and others like it are impeccably timed and utterly hilarious. I’ve shown them to\neveryone from college kids to financial service executives and everyone laughs until their sides hurt.\nBut note that what makes these videos so great is not just that they’re funny. The commercial would\nhave been just as funny if the guy was dressed in a chicken suit or if the tagline was, “Never say no to\nJim’s used cars.” Someone dressed in an animal suit kicking groceries is funny regardless of which\nanimal it is or what product it’s for.\nThey’re successful—and great examples of valuable virality—because the brand is an integral part\nof the stories. Mentioning the panda is a natural part of the conversation. In fact, you’d have to try\npretty hard not to mention the panda and still have the story make sense (much less get people to\nunderstand why it’s funny). So the best part of the story and the brand name are perfectly intertwined.\nThat increases the chance not only that people telling the story will talk about Panda the brand, but\nalso that they will remember what product the commercial is for, days or even weeks later. Panda is\npart and parcel of the story. It’s an essential part of the narrative.\nThe same can be said for Blendtec’s Will It Blend? campaign. It’s impossible to tell the story of\nthe clips where the blender tears through an iPhone without talking about a blender. And without\nrecognizing that the Blendtec blender in the videos must be extremely tough—so strong that it can\nblend almost anything. Which is exactly what Blendtec wants to communicate.\n—————\nIn trying to craft contagious content, valuable virality is critical. That means making the idea or\ndesired benefit a key part of the narrative. It’s like the plot of a good detective story. Some details are\ncritical to the narrative and some are extraneous. Where were the different suspects at the time of the\nmurder? Critical. What was the detective eating for dinner while he mulled over the details of the\ncase? Not so important.\nThe same distinction can be applied to the content we’ve been discussing. Take Ron Bensimhon’s\nOlympic stunt. Jumping into a pool? Critical. GoldenPalace.com? Pretty much irrelevant.\nThe importance of these different types of details becomes even clearer when people retell the\nstory. Think about the story of the Trojan Horse. It has survived for thousands of years. There is a\nwritten account of the story, but most of the details people know come from hearing someone else talk\nabout it. But which details people remember and retell? It isn’t random. Critical details stick around,\nwhile irrelevant ones drop out.\nPsychologists Gordon Allport and Joseph Postman examined a similar issue more than fifty years\nago. They were keenly interested in what happened to rumors as they spread from person to person.\nDid the stories stay the same as they were transmitted or did they change? And if they changed, were\nthere predictable patterns in how rumors evolved?\nTo address this question, they had people play what most of us would describe as a game of\nTelephone.\nFirst, someone was shown a picture of a detailed situation—in one case, a group of people on a\nsubway car. The car appears to be an Eighth Avenue Express and it is going past Dyckman Street.\nThere are various advertisements posted on the car, and five people are seated, including a rabbi and\na mother carrying her baby. But the focus of the picture is two men having an argument. They are\nstanding up, and one is pointing at the other and holding a knife.\nThen the game of Telephone starts. The first person (transmitter) is asked to describe the picture to\nsomeone else (receiver), who cannot see it. The transmitter conveys the various details as he sees fit.\nThe transmitter then leaves the room and a new person enters. That new person becomes the receiver,\nand the original receiver becomes the transmitter, sharing what happened in the image with the new\nreceiver, who also hasn’t seen the image. Then the original receiver leaves the room, a new person\nenters, and the game is repeated to a fourth, fifth, and eventually sixth person. Allport and Postman\nthen looked at which story details persisted along the transmission chain.\nThey found that the amount of information shared dropped dramatically each time the rumor was\nshared. Around 70 percent of the story details were lost in the first five to six transmissions.\nBut the stories didn’t just become shorter: they were also sharpened around the main point or key\ndetails. Across dozens of transmission chains there were common patterns. Certain details were\nconsistently left out and certain details were consistently retained. In the story about the subway car\nthe first person telling the story mentioned all the details. They talked about how the subway car\nseemed to be an Eighth Avenue Express, how it was going past Dyckman Street, and how there were\na number of people on it, two of them arguing.\nBut as the story was passed on down the telephone line, many of the unimportant details got\nstripped out. People stopped talking about what type of subway it was or where it was traveling and\ninstead focused on the argument. The fact that one person was pointing at the other and brandishing a\nknife. Just as in the detective story, people mentioned the critical details and left out the extraneous\nones.\n—————\nIf you want to craft contagious content, try to build your own Trojan Horse. But make sure you think\nabout valuable virality. Make sure the information you want people to remember and transmit is\ncritical to the narrative. Sure, you can make your narrative funny, surprising, or entertaining. But if\npeople don’t connect the content back to you, it’s not going to help you very much. Even if it goes\nviral.\nSo build a Social Currency–laden, Triggered, Emotional, Public, Practically Valuable Trojan\nHorse, but don’t forget to hide your message inside. Make sure your desired information is so\nembedded into the plot that people can’t tell the story without it.\nEpilogue\nAsk three people where they got their last manicure, and chances are good that at least one of them\nhad a Vietnamese nail technician. But the story of how it got that way might surprise you. It started\nwith twenty women and a set of long coral nails.\nShe’d been a high school teacher in her home country, but when Thuan Le arrived at Hope Village\nin 1975, she had nothing but the clothes on her back. The tent city outside Sacramento was a holding\nground for Vietnamese refugees who escaped to America after the fall of Saigon. Teeming with new\nimmigrants, the camp simultaneously brimmed with hope and despair. People had come to America\nwith dreams of a better life for themselves and their families, but with little English knowledge, so\nthe possibilities were limited.\nActress Tippi Hedren, who had starred in Alfred Hitchcock’s The Birds, was drawn to the\nrefugees’ plight and would visit Hope Village every few days. Hedren wanted to help, so she became\na mentor to some of the women. Former business owners, teachers, and government officials in\nVietnam, these industrious women were eager to get to work. Hedren was enchanted by their stories\nof Vietnam. They, in turn, noticed something about her: her beautiful nails.\nThe women admired Hedren’s glossy light pink fingernails, so she brought her manicurist in once a\nweek to give them lessons. How to trim cuticles, wrap nails, and remove calluses. The women were\nquick studies and practiced on Hedren, themselves, and anyone they could get their hands on.\nSoon a plan was hatched. Hedren got the women free classes at a nearby beauty school. They\nlearned how to file, paint, and trim. Then Hedren asked around and helped Le and the other women\nfind jobs in Santa Monica and surrounding cities.\nIt was tough at first. Manicures were not yet the rage and there was lots of competition. But Le and\nthe other women passed their licensing exams and started doing business. They worked hard, labored\nlong hours, and took the jobs no one else wanted. The women were diligent and kept at it. They made\nmoney and worked their way up.\nSeeing Le’s success, a few of her friends decided to get into the business. They opened one of the\nfirst beauty salons owned by Vietnamese Americans and encouraged others to do the same.\nThe success stories soon spread. The thousands of Vietnamese who came to the United States\nlooking for new possibilities heard what others were doing, and they listened. Vietnamese nail salons\nstarted opening up all around Sacramento. Then through the rest of California. Then the entire country.\nThese twenty women started the trend, but soon it had a life of its own.\nToday, 80 percent of manicurists in California are Vietnamese Americans. Nationwide the number\nis greater than 40 percent.\nVietnamese nail salons became contagious.\n—————\nThe story of Thuan, Tippi, and the spread of Vietnamese nail salons is pretty amazing. But even\nmore surprising is the fact that it’s not unique.\nOther immigrant groups have cornered similar niches. Estimates suggest that Cambodian\nAmericans own approximately 80 percent of the doughnut shops in Los Angeles, and that Koreans\nown 65 percent of the dry cleaners in New York City. In the 1850s, 60 percent of the liquor stores in\nBoston were run by Irishmen. In the early 1900s, Jews produced 85 percent of men’s clothes. The list\ngoes on.\nWhen you think about it, these stories make a lot of sense. People move to a new country and start\nlooking for work. But while the immigrants may have had various skilled jobs previously, their\noptions in the new country are often limited. There is a language barrier, it’s tough to transfer\nprevious certifications or qualifications, and they don’t have as many contacts as they had back home.\nSo immigrants look to their friends and acquaintances for help.\nAnd as with the rest of the products and ideas we’ve talked about throughout the book, social\ninfluence and word of mouth kick in. The topic of employment is frequent among new immigrants\nlooking for work (Triggers). So they look to see what jobs other recent immigrants have taken\n(Public) and talk to them about the best opportunities. These more established immigrants want to\nlook good (Social Currency) and help others (Practical Value) so they tell exciting (Emotion)\nnarratives (Stories) about others they know who have been successful.\nSoon these new immigrants follow their peers and pursue the same line of work.\n—————\nThe story of Vietnamese manicurists, and immigrants’ choice of occupations more generally,\nhighlights a number of points we’ve discussed throughout the book.\nFirst, any product, idea, or behavior can be contagious. We’ve talked about blenders ( Will It\nBlend?), bars (Please Don’t Tell), and breakfast cereals (Cheerios). “Naturally” exciting products,\nlike discount shopping (Rue La La) and high-end restaurants (Barclay Prime’s hundred-dollar\ncheesesteak) and less traditionally buzz-worthy goods like corn (Ken Craig’s “Clean Ears\nEverytime”) and online search (Google’s “Parisian Love”). Products (iPod’s white headphones) and\nservices (Hotmail) but also nonprofits (Movember and Livestrong bands), health behaviors (“Man\nDrinks Fat”), and whole industries (Vietnamese nail salons). Even soap (Dove’s “Evolution”). Social\ninfluence helps all sorts of products and ideas catch on.\nSecond, we saw that rather than being caused by a handful of special “influential” people, social\nepidemics are driven by the products and ideas themselves.\nSure, every great story has a hero. Tippi Hedren helped Vietnamese women learn about manicures,\nand George Wright had the creative idea that started Will It Blend? But while these individuals\nprovided the initial spark, they’re only one small part of the story. Describing why a small handful of\ncool or connected people (so-called influentials) are not as important to social epidemics as we\nmight think, sociologist Duncan Watts makes a nice comparison to forest fires. Some forest fires are\nbigger than others, but no one would claim that the size of the fire depends on the exceptional nature\nof the initial spark. Big forest fires aren’t caused by big sparks. Lots of individual trees have to catch\nfire and carry the flames.\nContagious products and ideas are like forest fires. They can’t happen without hundreds, if not\nthousands, of regular Joes and Janes passing the product or message along.\nSo why did thousands of people transmit these products and ideas?\nAnd that’s where we get to the third point: certain characteristics make products and ideas more\nlikely to be talked about and shared. You might have thought it was just random why some things\ncatch on, that certain products and ideas just got lucky. But it’s not just luck. And it’s not a mystery.\nThe same key principles drive all sorts of social epidemics. Whether it’s about getting people to save\npaper, see a documentary, try a service, or vote for a candidate, there is a recipe for success. The\nsame six principles, or STEPPS, drive things to catch on.\nSocial Currency\nWe share things that make us look good\nTriggers\nTop of mind, tip of tongue\nEmotion\nWhen we care, we share\nPublic\nBuilt to show, built to grow\nPractical Value\nNews you can use\nStories\nInformation travels under the guise of idle chatter\nSo if we’re trying to make a product or idea contagious, think about how to build in these key\nSTEPPS.\nSome of this can happen in the design of the product or idea itself. The hundred-dollar cheesesteak\nwas engineered to have Social Currency. Rebecca Black’s song was frequently triggered because of\nits title. Susan Boyle’s performance evoked lots of Emotion. Movember raised millions for men’s\ncancer by taking a once private behavior and using moustaches to make it Public. Ken Craig’s “Clean\nEars Everytime” video is two minutes of pure Practical Value.\nBut these STEPPS can also be built into messaging around a product or idea. Blendtec’s blenders\nhad always been powerful, but by showing that power in a remarkable way, the Will It Blend? videos\ngenerated Social Currency and got people buzzing. Kit Kat didn’t change its product, but by linking it\nto a popular beverage (coffee), the company increased the number of Triggers to make people think\n(and talk) about the candy bar. People share Vanguard’s MoneyWhys because they provide Practical\nValue, but passing them along boosts word of mouth for the company itself. People shared Dove’s\n“Evolution” video because it evokes lots of Emotion, but by embedding itself in the narrative, Dove\nbenefits from the chatter as well.\nIf you want to apply this framework, here’s a checklist you can use to see how well your product or\nidea is doing on the six different STEPPS.\nFollow these six key STEPPS, or even just a few of them, and you can harness social influence and\nword of mouth to get any product or idea to catch on.\nOne last note. The best part of the STEPPS framework is that anyone can use it. It doesn’t require a\nhuge advertising budget, marketing genius, or some sort of creativity gene. Yes, the viral videos and\ncontagious content we’ve talked about were created by particular individuals, but not all of them\nwere famous or could boast ten thousand followers on Twitter. They relied on one or more of the six\nkey STEPPS and this made their products and ideas more contagious.\nSocial\nCurrency\nDoes talking about your product or idea make people look good? Can you find the inner remarkability? Leverage game\nmechanics? Make people feel like insiders?\nTriggers\nConsider the context. What cues make people think about your product or idea? How can you grow the habitat and make it\ncome to mind more often?\nEmotion Focus on feelings. Does talking about your product or idea generate emotion? How can you kindle the fire?\nPublic\nDoes your product or idea advertise itself? Can people see when others are using it? If not, how can you make the private\npublic? Can you create behavioral residue that sticks around even after people use it?\nPractical\nValue\nDoes talking about your product or idea help people help others? How can you highlight incredible value, packaging your\nknowledge and expertise into useful information others will want to disseminate?\nStories\nWhat is your Trojan Horse? Is your product or idea embedded in a broader narrative that people want to share? Is the story\nnot only viral, but also valuable?\nHoward Wein needed a way to help a new restaurant break through the clutter, a way to raise\nawareness while staying true to the Barclay Prime brand. The hundred-dollar cheesesteak did just\nthat. It not only provided a remarkable (Social Currency), surprising (Emotion) narrative (Story) but\nalso illustrated the type of quality product that the steakhouse offered (Practical Value). And the\nprevalence of cheesesteaks in Philadelphia offered ready reminders for people to pass it on\n(Triggers). The hundred-dollar cheesesteak got people talking and helped make Barclay Prime a\nrousing success.\nGeorge Wright had almost no marketing budget. He needed a way to generate buzz about a product\nmost people wouldn’t ordinarily talk about: a blender. By thinking about what made his product\ncompelling and wrapping that idea in a broader narrative, he was able to generate hundreds of\nmillions of views and boost sales. The Will It Blend? clips are amazing (Emotion) and remarkable\n(Social Currency). But by making the product’s benefits (Practical Value) integral to a broader\nnarrative (Stories), the videos provided a perfect Trojan horse to get people talking about an\neveryday household appliance and make Blendtec catch on.\nRegular people with regular products and ideas. But by harnessing the psychology of word of\nmouth, they were able to make their products and ideas succeed.\nThroughout the book we’ve discussed cutting-edge science about how word of mouth and social\ninfluence work. If you follow these six key STEPPS, you can make any product or idea contagious.\nAcknowledgments\nWhenever I said I was writing a book, people often asked whether anyone was helping me. While I\ndid not have a co-author, that question was tough to answer because this book would never have\nreached fruition without countless people’s help.\nFirst, I want to thank my various collaborators over the years. People like Ezgi Akpinar, Eric\nBradlow, Dave Balter and the team at BzzAgent, Gráinne Fitzsimons, Raghu Iyengar, Ed Keller and\nthe folks at Keller Fay Group, Blake McShane, Katy Milkman, Eric Schwartz, and Morgan Ward,\nwithout whom the papers I discussed in the book would not have been possible. Bright students like\nRebecca Greenblatt, Diana Jiang, Lauren McDevitt, Geneva Long, Keri Taub, and Jennifer Wu\nhelped support these projects. Malcolm Gladwell wrote the amazing book that sent me down this\nroad. Anna Mastri pushed me to be a better writer, and books by Seth Godin, Stanley Lieberson,\nEverett Rogers, Emanuel Rosen, Thomas Schelling, and Jonathan Weiner inspired me to pursue this\nline of research. A debt of gratitude also goes out to people like Glenn Moglen, who introduced me to\nacademic research; Emily Pronin, who introduced me to social psychology; Noah Mark, who\nintroduced me to sociology; and Lee Ross and Itamar Simonson, who said to always shoot for big\nideas. Thanks also to all my colleagues at Wharton and Stanford and all the teachers and staff at\nMontgomery Blair High School and Takoma Park Middle School who taught me, and thousands of\nother lucky kids, about the wonders of math and science.\nSecond, I want to thank the people who made the book itself possible. Dan Ariely, Dan Gilbert,\nand Sarah Lehrer helped me understand what writing a book really meant. Alice LaPlante sharpened\nthe writing. Jim Levine and all of his colleagues at Levine Greenberg Literary Agency were guiding\nlights throughout the process. Jonathan Karp, Bob Bender, Tracey Guest, Richard Rhorer, Michael\nAccordino, and the rest of the team at Simon & Schuster helped form these ideas into a real book.\nAnthony Cafaro, Colleen Chorak, Ken Craig, Ben Fischman, Denise Grady, Koreen Johannessen,\nScott MacEachern, Jim Meehan, Tim Piper, Ken Segall, Brian Shebairo, Howard Wein, and George\nWright took the time to share their stories with me. Various Wharton Executive EMBA students were\nnice enough to provide feedback on the draft. The UPenn lunchtime soccer crew provided a welcome\nbreak from writing. Maria Ana brought an eagle eye to revising. My brother, Fred, Danny, and the\nwhole Bruno family not only gave feedback on the drafts but reminded me why I was doing all of this\nin the first place.\nA few more people deserve special note. First, to Chip, who not only has been an advisor, mentor,\nand friend, but has taught me most of what I know about writing and research: I cannot thank you\nenough. Second, to Jordan for sticking through the process with me and being both a thoughtful editor\nand a tireless champion, depending on what was needed. Third, to my parents, Diane Arkin and\nJeffrey Berger, not only for reading and supporting this project, but for laying the groundwork to make\nit all possible. And finally, to my grandmother. For kicking off this journey and supporting me along\nthe way.\nContagious: Why Things Catch On\nBy Jonah Berger\nSimon & Schuster Readers Group Guide\nWhat makes products and ideas catch on and become popular? Why do some stories get shared more\nthan others? Why are some rumors infectious? What makes things “go viral”?\nIn Contagious, Jonah Berger shares the secret science behind social transmission. Why we talk about\nand share some things rather than others. Why we pass things on. Filled with engaging stories and\ncomprehensive research Contagious is an essential tool for anyone that wants to make their product\nor idea spread.\nQUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION\n1) Consider and discuss the most recent email forward you received. It might have been a news\narticle, video, or story. What aspects of the STEPPS framework did it adhere to? Do the same\nanalysis for the last viral video you watched, hot restaurant you tried, hit movie you saw, etc.\nWhich concepts in the framework apply?\n2) Which examples that Berger mentioned (e.g., Blendtec, Dove’s Evolution, white iPhone\nearbuds) had you been aware of before the book? Trace how these cultural touchstones came to\nyou.\n3) Discuss and analyze something you do using the lens of game mechanics. What makes that\ngame, club, website, community, or activity so engaging? Consider each of the STEPPS. What\nkeeps you hooked? Also, why do we value achievement so much? Where is an area you’ve\nnoticed yourself being motivated by it?\n4) Can mundane things (like a blender) really diffuse through public consciousness as quickly as\nremarkable things can? Does sensationalism or novelty (inherent remarkability) carry an\nadvantage, even when STEPPS are considered?\n5) What is an example where you’ve noticed yourself being motivated by scarcity? New high\ntech devices (new phones, gadgets, etc.) are frequently scarce when they are released. Does\npossession of these products carry social currency? Does their frequent release (a veritable\nflooding of the market) make them less scarce?\n6) Would you brave the phone lines to enter Please Don't Tell? What about its seclusion appeals\nto you? Is there also something that turns you off to the fight for a seat?\n7) Compare an instance of ongoing and immediate word of mouth. Is one more powerful than\nthe other?\n8) Without thinking too hard, what is currently top of mind for you? Can you identify triggers is\nyour own life that bring things to mind? For example, whenever I see or hear __________ I think\nabout ____________.\n9) Like the Mars Bar and Rebecca Black's Friday, discuss products or campaigns that have\n\"natural\" triggers. Does having a pre-existing \"habitat\" increase likelihood of sharing? Of\npurchase?\n10) Discuss high-arousal versus low-arousal emotions. What are some examples of each that you’ve\nnoticed in your own lives? Is it strange that \"contentment\" (which so many people strive for in\nevery day life) elicits little arousal? Have you ever shared something sad?\n11) Privacy is a paramount concern in today's information-driven digital era. How does this fit with\nthe idea of making the private public? (Consider Movember, Hotmail, and the Facebook\ngeneration.). When do we want our choices and opinions to be public versus private? Where are\nthe lines drawn between open and closed information?\n12) Watch Tim Piper/Dove’s Evolution video. Discuss the idea of Trojan Horses and how emotion is\ncoded into the narrative of ideas.\n13) Which aspect of STEPPS do you think is most affective? Compare Berger’s various examples of\nSocial Currency, Triggers, Emotions, Public, Practical Value, and Stories. Is one of these\ncharacteristics most important for driving sharing? Is there a specific combination that makes one\nthing more appealing than another?\nEXPAND YOUR BOOK CLUB\n1. Perform an experiment and monitor the “most emailed” section of NYTimes.com for a week.\nDo you begin to notice patterns in what is shared? Consider arousal emotions, practical value,\nand the very subject matter of the articles.\n2. Keep a transmission journal and note the ways in which products, ideas, campaigns, and\ncompanies use the tenets of human behavioral sharing to make their wares “stick” and “spread.”\nHow much of your life is subject to the basic STEPPS?\n3. Create your own viral video with the STEPPS in mind. What are the challenges of making\nsomething that addresses all of these sharing factors? Track the success of your video and how\npeople react. Have you cracked the code to viral content?\nA CONVERSATION WITH JONAH BERGER\n1. The Harvard neuro study revealing that sharing is rewarding in the same way as food and\nother high-pleasure reward was incredibly interesting. Taking this into consideration, how do\nyou explain what is referred to as the “me” generation of Twitter and Facebook, in which\nindividuals share the most minute aspects of their everyday lives. Are all generations focused on\n“me?” Is there something different going on in modernity?\nPeople have always thought about and cared about themselves, but social media makes this easier to\nsee because it creates a written record of our actions. What we said, what we shared, and what we\n“like.” But research suggests that these methods of communication may also contribute to making us\n“me” focused. Computer mediated communication, and talking to large groups (rather than a single\nother), may focus us more on ourselves and less on the wants and needs of others.\n2. What’s the most recent thing you shared? And what was most recently shared with you?\nWow. Good question. One thing I recently shared was a New York Times article that has a quote\nrelated to a research project we’re working on. One thing I just received was a restaurant\nrecommendation for good Asian fried chicken. I had talked about something related in a Financial\nTimes article about brand extensions, and someone who read the article sent me a note to prove me\nwrong!\n3. Do you think you’ve cracked the code of efficient product advertising? Would you ever try\nyour hand at it?\nCan we make ads more effective and viral? Yes. Have we “cracked the code”? There is always more\nto learn. Definitely like trying my hand at it. I often help companies use the STEPPS framework to\nimprove their products and ideas and it is always lots of fun.\n4. Along those same lines, have any of your students gone on to become successful\nadvertisers/viral video makers/idea-spreaders?\nDefinitely. I teach an exercise in my class where students use the STEPPS framework to try and\ncreate a viral video. It’s tough but some people do amazingly well!\n5. Discuss how you think sharing today compares to sharing 30 years ago. What about our digital\nculture has made things different? Has sharing decreased in any way?\nSharing today is certainly different in some ways. There is less face-to-face interaction with our\nfriends and family, so we talk more over the phone or through the web. Research shows that this\ndecreases some of the benefits of social interaction. Warm interpersonal contact reduces stress, but\nthings like texting don’t have the same effect. Do we share less? Doubtful, but we do share\ndifferently.\n6. The nature of current commercials seems more and more “off-brand,” as companies create\nnon-sequitur and nonsensical ads to elicit a laugh or capitalize on “irony.” Are they failing to\nfollow the STEPPS? Is there remarkability to silliness un-related to product? (Unlike the Panda\nin the food store).\nFunny ads are great. And as a consumer, I love to watch them. But if the goal is not just to make\npeople laugh, but to get them to buy something, then valuable virality becomes vital. People will\nshare funny or ironic ads, but at the end of the day it doesn’t help the company if the consumer has no\nidea what the ad was for.\n7. Do you think most STEPPS happen at the unconscious level, or do you believe people create\nthings with these fundamental human behaviors in mind?\nPeople are more aware of some of the STEPPS than others. Practical Value? We see that every day.\nSocial Currency? We see it in others all the time (even if it’s hard to see in ourselves). But we are\nless aware of how Triggers or Public affects our behavior.\n8. Is there something to be said for over-saturation? Can a good method of viral sharing exhaust\nitself in our fast-as-lightning culture?\nThere is a key difference between psychology and marketing tactics. We may get over-saturated with\na particular tactic (e.g., pop-up ads or a certain style of ad) but the underlying psychology that drove\nus to like it still remains. If every company makes their product “scarce” consumers will start to catch\non, but does that mean we’ll stop valuing scarcity altogether? Probably not.\n9. Is one element of STEPPS more vital than the others?\nNo one of the STEPPS is most important, but certain ones are definitely easier to apply in certain\nsituations. It’s easier to leverage Public if you have a physical product. It’s easier to use Emotion if\nyou sell something related to children or animals. But the key is not just using the easy STEPPS.\nTrying to incorporate the more difficult ones will really boost their impact.\n10. Have you ever eaten the $100 cheesesteak at Barclay’s?\nYes.

If you’re\ntrying to get people to check out a website, then online word of mouth is great because the desired\naction is only a click away. The same thing is true with offline products or behaviors. Online word\nof mouth about pasta sauce is great, but people need to remember to buy it when they’re actually in\nthe store, so offline word of mouth may be even better. Also think about whether and where people\ndo research before they buy. While most people buy a car offline, they do a lot of research online\nand may make their decision before they ever step into the dealership. In those instances, online\nword of mouth may sway their decision.\nOnly one-third of 1 percent: See http://articles.businessinsider.com/2009-05-\n20/tech/30027787_1_tubemogul-videos-viral-hits.\n“by the efforts”: Gladwell, Malcolm (2000), The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a\nBig Difference (New York: Little, Brown).\n“one in 10 Americans”: Keller, Ed, and Jon Berry (2003), The Influentials: One American in Ten\nTells the Other Nine How to Vote, Where to Eat, and What to Buy (New York: Free Press).\nmaking things go viral: Right now there is little good empirical evidence that people who have more\nsocial ties or who are more persuasive have a bigger impact on what catches on.

We were especially interested\nin the fact that we could analyze the buzz generated by each product by agent. After all, certain\npeople might share more word of mouth than others: Chatty Cathys talk more than Quiet Quentins.\nBut by looking at how much individual agents talked across different campaigns, we could identify\npatterns. We could see whether an agent talked more about a coffee brand than a new type of digital\ncamera. And we could start to understand why certain products got more word of mouth than\nothers. Not just whether people talked about certain product categories (such as food) more than\nothers (such as movies), but what really drives discussion in the first place—the psychology of\ntalk.\nsome thoughts are more top of mind: Accessibility is a huge topic in psychology; for some classic\nresearch on the topic, see Higgins, E.

Please ask questions related to this area.\"*  \n\n🔹 If a user asks for marketing advice, ensure it aligns with:  \n   - **Modern branding & ethical marketing principles** (*audience trust & brand loyalty matter more than quick sales*).  \n   - **Word-of-mouth and viral growth strategies** (*leveraging psychological triggers to create shareable content*).  \n   - **Building a tribe of loyal customers instead of chasing mass appeal** (*focusing on the right customers, not everyone*).  \n\n🔹 **Confidentiality Rule:**  \n   - **Do not mention the book names or that your knowledge comes from them.**  \n   - **Do not disclose any information about data sources used for responses.**  \n   - If a user asks where the advice is coming from, answer generically:  \n     - *\"This is based on proven marketing principles and best practices.\"*  \n\n💡 **Example Response Flow:**  \n**User:** \"How can I increase engagement on my brand’s Instagram page?\"  \n**Gemini:** \"Before advising, can you share details about:  \n1. Your target audience and the type of content you currently post?  \n2. Your engagement rate and what has worked well so far?  \n3. Whether you focus more on organic reach or paid promotions?  \n4. Any specific goals—brand awareness, conversions, or community building?\"  \n\nOnce the user provides details, **give answers based on modern marketing strategies** without referencing book names or training sources.  \n\n",
