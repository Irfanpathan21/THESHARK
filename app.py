I was 25 years\nold, it was 1986, and I had just landed a summer job in a venture\ncapital firm. I was working for three experienced venture capitalists\nin a small firm called Euclid Partners, where I ended up spending\nthe first 10 years of my VC career. One of those three partners,\nBliss McCrum, peeked his head into my office (I had an office in\nRockefeller Center at age 25) and said to me, “Can you model out\na financing for XYZ Company at a $9 million pre-money, raising\n$3 million, with an unissued option pool of 10%?” and then went\nback to the big office in the rear he shared with the other founding\npartner, Milton Pappas.\nI sat at my desk and started thinking about the request. I\nunderstood the “raising $3 million” bit. I thought I could figure\nout the “unissued option pool of 10%” bit. But what the hell was\n“pre-money”? I had never heard that term. This was almost a decade\nbefore Netscape and Internet search so searching online for it wasn’t\nan option. After spending ten minutes getting up the courage, I\nwalked back to that big office, peeked my head in, and said to Bliss,\n“Can you explain pre-money to me?”\nThus began my 31-year education in venture capital that is still\ngoing on as I write this.\nThe venture capital business was a cottage industry back in 1985,\nwith club deals and a language all of its own. A cynic would say it was\ndesigned this way to be opaque to everyone other than the VCs so that\nthey would have all the leverage in negotiations with entrepreneurs.\nI don’t entirely buy that narrative. I think the VC business grew up in\na few small offices in Boston, New York, and San Francisco, and the\ndozens—maybe as many as a hundred—of main participants, along\nwww.itdf.ir\nxiv Foreword\nwith their lawyers, came up with structures that made sense to them.\nThey then developed a shorthand so that they could communicate\namong themselves.\nBut whatever the origin story was, the language of venture deals\nis foreign to many and remains opaque and confusing to this day.\nThis works to the advantage of industry insiders and to the disadvantage of those who are new to startups and venture capital.\nIn the early 2000s, after I wound down my first venture capital\nfirm, Flatiron Partners, and before we started USV, I started blogging.\nOne of my goals with my AVC blog (at www.avc.com) was to bring\ntransparency to this opaque world that I had been inhabiting for\nalmost 20 years. I was joined in this blogging thing by Brad Feld, a\nfriend and frequent coinvestor. Club investing has not gone away\nand that’s a good thing. By reading AVC and Feld Thoughts regularly, an entrepreneur could get up to speed on startups and venture\ncapital. Brad and I received a tremendous amount of positive feedback on our efforts to bring transparency to the venture capital business so we kept doing it, and now if you search for something like\n“participating preferred” you will find posts written by both me and\nBrad on that first search results page.\nBrad and his partner Jason Mendelson (a recovering startup lawyer turned VC) took things a step further and wrote a book called\nVenture Deals back in 2011. It has turned into a classic and is now on\nits Third Edition. If Venture Deals had been around in 1985, I would\nnot have had to admit to Bliss that I had no idea what pre-money\nmeant.\nIf there is a guidebook to navigating the mysterious and confusing\nlanguage of venture capital and venture capital financing structures,\nit is Venture Deals. Anyone interested in startups, entrepreneurship,\nand angel and venture capital financings should do themselves a\nfavor and read it.\nFred Wilson\nUSV Partner\nJuly 2016\nwww.itdf.ir\nxv\nForeword\nI remember the first time I saw the exit sign for Sand Hill Road\noff of Highway 280. It was 1999. I was 22 years old, had just dropped\nout of Harvard, and was the cofounder and CTO of a startup based\nin Boston. My cofounder and I decided to cast the net wide in our\nsearch for money and flew out to Silicon Valley to meet with VCs.\nAs I saw the exit for Sand Hill Road, I started to feel incredibly nervous and unwell. I immediately noticed the telltale signs of a distinct\nlack of preparation and knowledge. I felt this way if I hadn't studied thoroughly for a test in school. In high school, right before a\ncross-country race, I felt this way if I hadn't put in enough miles of\nrunning in practice. By this time, hadn't I learned my lesson about\npreparation and its effect on my digestive system? Why did I show up\nto such important meetings so uninformed about the people and\nthe industry from whom I was trying to raise money from? Well, in\n1999, it wasn't so easy for a 22-year-old first-time entrepreneur to\nfigure all of this out.\nWe did succeed in raising money for that startup, but due to\nour own mistakes and the tough environment at the time, we ended\nup closing our doors a couple of years later. However, I made a\ncouple of great friends, Eric and Gokhan, from that startup, and\nwe picked ourselves up and immediately started another company\ncalled Windup Labs. After four years of incredibly hard work, we\nsold Windup to CNET Networks (now part of CBS Interactive) in\n2005, and as part of the acquisition, we all moved to San Francisco.\nIn 2007, Eric and I left CNET to start Fitbit. Eric and I started\noff with fairly modest ambitions for the company, but as the years\npassed, our ambitions grew. From 2007 to today, the company\ngrew to over 1,500 employees, and our most recent guidance to\nwww.itdf.ir\nxvi Foreword\ninvestors called for approximately $2.5 billion in revenue in 2016. We\nraised over $66 million in private capital from VCs, including Brad\nand Jason at Foundry Group. In 2015, Fitbit went public, raising over\n$800 million in the largest-ever consumer electronics initial public\noffering (IPO) in history. I've remained its CEO from founding to\ntoday.\nAs I read this book, I was amazed at how succinctly it captured\nthe sum of my 16 years of experience raising money, dealing, and\nworking with VCs and corporate lawyers. I wish I could travel back\nin time and hand this book off to my nervous and ill 22-year-old self\n(along with an iPhone and the idea for Facebook).\nYou, the reader, have gotten a huge bargain. After finishing this\nbook, you will have skipped years of painful experience, trial and\nerror, and learning on the clock from expensive lawyers. This is the\nbusiness book equivalent of Neo jacking in and learning kung fu in\nan instant in The Matrix. As you find yourself driving down 280 (or,\ndepending on how long this foreword lasts, being whisked in your\nautonomous electric car) and the sign for Sand Hill Road comes\ninto view, feel confident that you've been prepared by some of the\nbest VCs I know.\nJames Park\nFitbit Cofounder and CEO\nJuly 2016\nwww.itdf.ir\nxvii\nPreface\nOne of the ways to finance a company is to raise venture capital.\nWhile only a small percentage of companies raise venture capital,\nmany of the great technology companies that have been created,\nincluding Google, Apple, Cisco Systems, Yahoo!, Netscape, Sun\nMicrosystems, Compaq, Digital Equipment Corporation, and\nAmerica Online (AOL) raised venture capital early in their lives.\nSome of today’s fastest-growing entrepreneurial companies, such\nas Facebook, Twitter, Airbnb, LinkedIn, Fitbit, and Uber were also\nrecipients of venture capital.\nOver the past 20 years we’ve been involved in hundreds of\nventure capital financings. A decade ago, after a particularly\nchallenging financing, we decided to write a series of blog posts that\nwould demystify the venture capital financing process. The result\nwas the Term Sheet Series on Brad’s blog (www.feld.com/archives/\ncategory/term-sheet), which was the inspiration for this book.\nAs each new generation of entrepreneurs emerges, there is a\nrenewed interest in how venture capital deals come together. We\nencounter many of these first-time entrepreneurs through our activities\nas venture capitalists at our firm Foundry Group (www.foundrygroup\n.com), as well as our involvement in Techstars (www.techstars.com).\nWe have been regularly reminded that there is no definitive guide to\nventure capital deals and as a result set out to create one.\nIn addition to describing venture capital deals in depth, we’ve\ntried to create context around the players, the deal dynamics,\nand how venture capital funds work. We’ve tossed in a section on\nnegotiation, if only to provide another viewpoint into the brains of\nhow a venture capitalist (at least the two of us) might think about\nnegotiation. We also took on explaining the other term sheet that\nwww.itdf.ir\nxviii Preface\nfortunate entrepreneurs will encounter—namely, the letter of intent\nto acquire your company.\nWe’ve tried to take a balanced view between the entrepreneurs’\nperspective and the venture capitalists’ perspective. As early-stage\ninvestors, we know we are biased toward an early-stage perspective,\nbut we try to provide context that will apply to any financing stage.\nWe’ve also tried to make fun of lawyers any chance we get.\nWe hope you find this book useful in your quest to create a great\ncompany.\nAudience\nWhen we first conceived this book, we planned to target it at firsttime entrepreneurs. We both have a long history of funding and\nworking with first-time entrepreneurs and often learn more from\nthem than they learn from us. Through our involvement in Techstars, we’ve heard a wide range of questions about financings and\nventure capital from first-time entrepreneurs. We’ve tried to do a\ncomprehensive job of addressing those questions in this book.\nAs we wrote the book, we realized it was also useful for experienced entrepreneurs. A number of the entrepreneurs who read\nearly drafts or heard about what we were writing gave us feedback\nthat they wished a book like this had existed when they were starting their first company. When we asked the question, “Would this be\nuseful for you today?” many said, “Yes, absolutely.” Several sections,\nincluding the ones on negotiation and how venture capital funds\nwork, were inspired by long dinner conversations with experienced\nentrepreneurs who told us that we had to write this stuff down, either\non our blog or in a book. Well—here it is!\nOf course, before one becomes a first-time entrepreneur, one\nis often an aspiring entrepreneur. This book is equally relevant\nfor the aspiring entrepreneur of whatever age. In addition, anyone in school who is interested in entrepreneurship—whether\nin business school, law school, an undergraduate program, or\nan advanced degree program—should benefit from this book.\nWe’ve both taught many classes on various topics covered in this\nbook and hope this becomes standard reading for any class on\nentrepreneurship.\nWe were once inexperienced venture capitalists. We learned\nmostly by paying attention to more experienced venture capitalists, as\nwww.itdf.ir\nPreface xix\nwell as actively engaging in deals. We hope this book becomes another\ntool in the tool chest for any young or aspiring venture capitalist.\nWhile we’ve aimed the book at entrepreneurs, we hope that even\nlawyers (especially those who don’t have much experience doing venture capital deals) and experienced venture capitalists will benefit from\nus putting these thoughts down in one place. At the minimum, we\nhope they recommend the book to their less experienced colleagues.\nFinally, unintended beneficiaries of this book are the spouses\nof venture capitalists, lawyers, and entrepreneurs, especially those\nentrepreneurs actively involved in a deal. While Brad’s wife, Amy, is\nquick to say, “Everything I’ve learned about venture came from overhearing your phone calls,” we hope other spouses can dip into this\nbook every now and then. This can be especially useful when your\nentrepreneurial life partner some empathy while complaining about\nhow a venture capitalist is trying to sneak a participating preferred\ninto a round.\nOverview of the Contents\nWe start off with a brief history of the venture capital term sheet\nand a discussion of the different parties who participate in venture\ncapital transactions.\nWe then discuss how to raise money from a venture capitalist,\nincluding determining how much money an entrepreneur should raise\nand what types of materials one will need before hitting the fundraising trail. Included in this section is a discussion about the process that\nmany venture capitalists follow to decide which companies to fund.\nWe then dive deeply into the particular terms that are included\nin venture capital term sheets. We’ve separated this into three\nchapters—terms related to economics, terms related to control,\nand all of the other terms. We strive to give a balanced view of the\nparticular terms along with strategies to getting to a fair deal.\nFollowing the chapters on terms, we discuss how convertible\ndebt works and the pros and cons versus raising equity.\nWe’ve introduced a new section in this edition about crowdfunding, how it differs from traditional venture capital deals, and how we\nthink the crowdfunding ecosystem will affect venture capital.\nWe then go into a frank discussion about how venture capital\nfirms operate, including how venture capitalists are motivated and\ncompensated. We then discuss how these structural realities can\nwww.itdf.ir\nxx Preface\nimpact a company’s chance of getting funded or the relationship\nbetween the venture capitalist, her firm, and the entrepreneur after\nthe investment is made.\nSince the process of funding involves a lot of negotiation, the\nbook contains a primer on negotiations and how particular strategies may work better or worse in the venture capital world. We\nalso attempt to help the entrepreneur learn ways to consummate a\ntransaction in a venture capital financing while avoiding common\nmistakes and pitfalls.\nSince there is no such thing as a standard venture capital\nfinancing, we cover different issues to consider that depend on the\nstage of financing a company is raising. We also discuss some of the\ntheories behind why any of these documents even exist so that you\ncan understand the hidden incentives in the process.\nAs a bonus, we’ve tossed in a chapter about the other important term sheet that entrepreneurs need to know about: the letter of\nintent to acquire your company.\nFinally, we end with why term sheets even exist in the first place\nalong with tips concerning several common legal issues that most\nstartups face. While not a dissertation on everything an entrepreneur needs to know, we’ve tried to include a few important things\nthat we think entrepreneurs should pay attention to.\nThroughout the book we’ve enlisted a close friend and longtime\nentrepreneur, Matt Blumberg, the CEO of Return Path, to add his\nperspective. Whenever you see a sidebar titled “The Entrepreneur’s\nPerspective,” these are comments from Matt on the previous section.\nAdditional Materials\nAlong with this book, we’ve created some additional materials that\nyou may want to review. They are all on the Venture Deals website at\nwww.venturedeals.com, which was referred to in previous editions as\nthe AsktheVC website at www.askthevc.com. And no, the price of the\nVenture Deals domain wasn’t very high.\nVenture Deals (previously AsktheVC) started out several years ago\nas a question-and-answer site that we managed. We’ve recently added\na new section called “Resources,” where the reader can find many\nstandard forms of documents that are used in venture financings.\nThey include the term sheet as well as all of the documents that are\ngenerated from the term sheet as part of a venture financing.\nwww.itdf.ir\nPreface xxi\nWe have included the standard forms that we use at Foundry\nGroup (you can use these if we ever finance your company). We’ve\nalso included links for the most popular standard documents that\nare used in the industry today, along with commentary about some\nof the advantages and disadvantages of using them.\nAdditional resources for classroom use are available to professors.\nPlease visit www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-119259754\n.html for more information.\nJason Mendelson and Brad Feld\nJuly 2016\nwww.itdf.ir\nAcknowledgments\nWe wouldn’t have been able to write this book without the able\nassistance of many people.\nA huge thanks goes to Matt Blumberg, CEO of Return Path,\nfor all of his insightful and entrepreneur-focused comments. Matt\nprovided all of the sidebars for “The Entrepreneur’s Perspective”\nthroughout the book, and his comments helped focus us (and hopefully you) on the key issues from an entrepreneur’s perspective.\nOur Foundry Group partners, Seth Levine, Ryan McIntyre, and\nLindel Eakman, put up with us whenever Brad said, “I’m working\non Jason’s book again,” and whenever Jason said, “I’m working on\nBrad’s book again.” We couldn’t do any of this without our amazing\ncolleagues at Foundry Group, including our assistants, Jill Spruiell\nand Mary Weingartner.\nA number of friends, colleagues, and mentors reviewed early\ndrafts of the book and gave us extensive feedback. Thanks to the\nfollowing for taking the time to meaningfully improve this book:\nAmy Batchelor, Raj Bhargava, Jeff Clavier, Greg Gottesman, Brian\nGrayson, Douglas Horch, David Jilk, TA McCann, George Mulhern,\nWiley Nelson, Heidi Roizen, Ken Tucker, and Jud Valeski.\nJack Tankersley, one of the fathers of the Colorado venture\ncapital industry, provided a number of his early deal books from his\ntime at Centennial Funds. In addition to being fascinating history\non some legendary early venture capital deals, they confirmed that\nthe term sheet hasn’t evolved much over the past 30 years. We’d also\nlike to thank Jack for the extensive comments he made on an early\ndraft of the book.\nThanks to Bill Aulet and Patricia Fuligni of the MIT Entrepreneurship Center for helping track down the original Digital Equipment\nCorporation correspondence between Ken Olson and Georges Doriot.\nOur VC brethren, whether they realize it or not, have had a huge\nimpact on this book. The ones we’ve learned from—both good and\nbad—are too numerous to list. But we want to thank them all for participating with us on our journey to help create amazing companies.\nwww.itdf.ir\nxxiv Acknowledgments\nWe can’t think of anything we’d rather be doing professionally, and\nwe learn something new from you every day.\nWe’ve worked with many lawyers over the years, some of whom\nhave taken us to school on various topics in this book. We thank\nyou for all of your help, advice, education, and entertainment. We’d\nespecially like to thank our friends Eric Jensen and Mike Platt at\nCooley LLP, who have consistently helped us during the fog of a\nnegotiation. Eric was Jason’s mentor, boss, and friend while at Cooley\nand originally taught Jason how all of this worked.\nWe’d like to thank one of Brad’s original mentors, Len Fassler,\nfor creating the spark that initiated this book. Len’s introduction\nto Matthew Kissner, the chairman at John Wiley & Sons, resulted\nin a two-book contract with Wiley, which included Do More Faster:\nTechStars Lessons to Accelerate Your Startup by Brad and David Cohen.\nAlthough Do More Faster was published first, the idea for this book\nwas the one that originally captured the attention of several people\nat Wiley.\nBrad would like to thank Pink Floyd for The Dark Side of the Moon\nand Wish You Were Here, two albums that kept him going throughout the seemingly endless “read through and edit this just one more\ntime” cycle. He’d also like to thank the great staff at Canyon Ranch in\nTucson for giving him a quiet place to work for the last week before\nthe “final final draft of the first edition” was due.\nJason would like to thank the University of Colorado Law School\nand especially Brad Bernthal and Phil Weiser for letting him subject\nhimself to both law and business students while teaching many of the\nsubjects contained in this book. Special thanks to Herbie Hancock\nfor providing the background music while Jason worked on this book.\nA number of friends and colleagues found errors in the first\nand second editions, which we dutifully listed at www.askthevc.com/\nwp/errata. Special thanks go to David Cohen, Anurag Mehta, Tom\nGodin, Philip Lee, Tal Adler, Jason Seats, and Jeff Thomas who were\nthe first to identify each error.\nWe thank all of the entrepreneurs we have ever had the chance\nto work with. Without you, we have nothing to do. Hopefully we have\nmade you proud in our attempt to amalgamate in this book all of the\ncollective wisdom we gained from working with you.\nFinally, we thank our wives, Amy Batchelor and Jennifer Mendelson, for putting up with us and making our lives so much more\nfulfilling.\nwww.itdf.ir\nVenture Deals\nwww.itdf.ir\n1\nIntroduction: The Art of the Term Sheet\nOne of the first famous venture capital investments was Digital\nEquipment Corporation (DEC). In 1957, American Research and\nDevelopment Corporation (AR&D), one of the first venture capital\nfirms, invested $70,000 in DEC. When DEC went public in 1968, this\ninvestment was worth over $355 million, or a return of over 5,000\ntimes the invested capital. AR&D’s investment in DEC was one of the\noriginal venture capital home runs.\nIn 1957, the venture capital industry was just being created. At the\ntime, the investor community in the United States was uninterested\nin investing in computer companies, as the last wave of computerrelated startups had performed poorly and even large companies\nwere having difficulty making money in the computer business. We\ncan envision the frustration of DEC’s cofounders, Ken Olson and\nHarlan Anderson, as the investors they talked to rejected them\nand their fledgling idea for a business. We can also imagine their\njoy when Georges Doriot, the founder of American Research and\nDevelopment Corporation, offered to fund them. After a number\nof conversations and meetings, Doriot sent Olson and Anderson a\nletter expressing his interest in investing, along with his proposed\nterms. Today, this document is called the term sheet.\nNow, imagine what that term sheet looked like. There are three\ndifferent possibilities. The first is that it was a typed one-page letter that said, “We would like to invest $70,000 in your company\nand buy 78 percent of it.” The next is that it was two pages of legal\nterms that basically said, “We would like to invest $70,000 in your\ncompany and buy 78 percent of it.” Or it could have been an eightpage typed document that had all kinds of protective provisions, vesting\nVenture Deals: Be Smarter than Your Lawyer\nand Venture Capitalist, Third Edition\nBy Brad Feld and Jason Mendelson\nCopyright © 2016 by Brad Feld and Jason Mendelson\nwww.itdf.ir\n2 Venture Deals\narrangements, drag-along rights, and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) registration rights.\nOur guess is that it was not the third option. Over the past 50\nyears, the art of the term sheet has evolved and expanded, reaching\nits current eight (or so) page literary masterpiece. These eight pages\ncontain a lot more than “We’d like to invest $X in your company\nand get Y% of it,” but, as you’ll learn, there really are only two key\nthings that matter in the actual term sheet negotiation—economics\nand control.\nIn DEC’s case, by owning 78% of the company, AR&D effectively had control of the company. And the price was clearly\ndefined—$70,000 bought 78% of the company, resulting in a $90,000\npost-money valuation.\nToday’s venture capital investments have many more nuances.\nIndividual venture capitalists (VCs) usually end up owning less than\n50 percent of the company, so they don’t have effective voting control but often negotiate provisions that give them control over major\ndecisions by the company. Many companies end up with multiple\nventure capitalists who invest in the company at different points in\ntime, resulting in different ownership percentages, varying rights,\nand diverging motivations. Founders don’t always stay with the company through the exit and, in some cases, they end up leaving relatively early in the life of a company for a variety of reasons. Companies fail, so venture capitalists have gotten much more focused on\nprotecting themselves for the downside as well as participating in the\nupside. Governance issues are always complex, especially when you\nhave a lot of people sitting around the negotiating table.\nWhile it would be desirable to do venture capital deals with a\nsimple agreement on price, a handshake, and a short legal agreement, this rarely happens. And while there have been plenty of\nattempts to standardize the term sheet over the years, the proliferation of lawyers, venture capitalists, and entrepreneurs, along with a\nsteadily increasing number of investments, has prevented this from\nhappening. Ironically, the actual definitive documents have become\nmore standard over time. Whether it is the Internet age that has\nspread information across the ecosystem or clients growing tired of\npaying legal bills, there are more similarities in the documents today\nthan ever before. As a result, we can lend you our experience in how\nventure financings are usually done. The good news is once you’ve\nwww.itdf.ir\nIntroduction: The Art of the Term Sheet 3\nnegotiated the term sheet, you are done with the hard part. As a\nresult, that’s where we are going to focus our energy in this book.\nThroughout this book we will cover not only the what and the\nhow, but also the why things work as they do. Let’s begin our exploration of venture capital financings by discussing the various players\ninvolved.\nwww.itdf.ir\n5\n1\nChapter\nhe layers \nWhile it might seem like there are only two players in the financing dance—the entrepreneur and the venture capitalist—there are\noften others, including angel investors, lawyers, and mentors. Any\nentrepreneur who has created a company that has gone through\nmultiple financings knows that the number of people involved can\nquickly spiral out of control, especially if you aren’t sure who actually\nis making the decisions at each step along the way.\nThe experience, motivation, and relative power of each participant in a financing can be complex, and the implications are often\nmysterious. Let’s begin our journey to understanding venture capital financings by making sure we understand each player and the\ndynamics surrounding the participants.\nhe ntrepreneur\nNot all investors (and bankers and lawyers, for that matter) realize it,\nbut the entrepreneur is the center of the entrepreneurial universe.\nWithout entrepreneurs there would be no term sheet and no startup\necosystem.\nThroughout this book we use the words entrepreneur and founder\ninterchangeably. While some companies have only one founder,\nmany have two, three, or even more. Sometimes these cofounders\nare equals; other times they aren’t. Regardless of the number, they\neach have a key role in the formation of the company and any financing that occurs.\nVenture Deals: Be Smarter than Your Lawyer\nand Venture Capitalist, Third Edition\nBy Brad Feld and Jason Mendelson\nCopyright © 2016 by Brad Feld and Jason Mendelson\nwww.itdf.ir\n6 Venture Deals\nThe founders can’t and shouldn’t outsource their involvement\nin a financing to their lawyers. There are many issues in a financing\nnegotiation that only the entrepreneurs can resolve. Even if you hire\na fantastic lawyer who knows everything, don’t forget that if your\nlawyer and your future investors don’t get along, you will have larger\nissues to deal with, as the way your lawyer represents himself will\ndirectly reflect on you. If you are the entrepreneur, make sure you\ndirect and control the process.\nThe relationship between the founders at the beginning of the\nlife of a company is almost always good. If it’s not, the term sheet and\ncorresponding financing are probably the least of the founders’ worries. However, as time passes, the relationship between cofounders\noften frays. This could be due to many different factors: the stress of\nthe business, competence, personality, or even changing life priorities like a new spouse or children.\nWhen this happens, one or more founders often leave the\nbusiness—sometimes on good terms and sometimes on not such\ngood terms. Some investors know that it’s best to anticipate these\nkinds of issues up front and will try to structure terms that predefine how things will work in these situations. The investors are\noften trying to protect the founders from each other by making\nsure things can be cleanly resolved without disrupting the company more than the departure of a founder already does.\nWe cover this dynamic in terms like vesting, drag-along rights,\nand co-sale rights. When we do, we discuss both the investor perspective and the entrepreneur perspective. You’ll see this throughout\nthe book—we’ve walked in both the investor’s and the entrepreneur’s shoes, and we try hard to take a balanced approach to our\ncommentary.\nhe Venture Capitalist\nThe venture capitalist (VC) is the next character in the term sheet\nplay. VCs come in many shapes, sizes, and experience levels. While\nmost (but not all) profess to be entrepreneur friendly, many fall far\nshort of their aspirations. The first sign of this often appears during\nthe term sheet negotiation.\nVenture capital firms have their own hierarchies that are important for an entrepreneur to understand. Later in the book we’ll dive\ninto all the deep, dark secrets about how VCs are motivated and\nwww.itdf.ir\nhe layers  7\npaid, and what their incentives can be. For now, we’ll consider VCs\nas humans and talk about the people.\nThe most senior person in the firm is usually called a managing\ndirector (MD) or a general partner (GP). In some cases, these titles have\nan additional prefix—such as executive managing director or founding\ngeneral partner —to signify even more seniority over the other managing directors or general partners. These VCs make the final investment decisions and sit on the boards of directors of the companies\nthey invest in.\nPartners are usually not what their title says they are. Many VCs\nthese days carry business cards with a “Partner” title but are not actually partners in the firm. Instead, they are often junior deal professionals (also referred to as principals or directors—see the next paragraph) or are involved in specific aspects of the investing process\nsuch as deal sourcing. In some firms, which are described as full-stack\nVC firms, these partners help companies across a variety of dimensions, including recruiting, operations, technology, sales, and marketing, but are not decision makers in the investment process.\nPrincipals, or directors, are usually next in line. These are junior\ndeal professionals working their way up the ladder to managing\ndirector. Principals usually have some deal responsibility, but they\nalmost always require support from a managing director to move a\ndeal through the VC firm. So while a principal has some power, he\nprobably can’t make a final decision.\nAssociates are typically not deal partners. Instead, they work\ndirectly for one or more deal partners, usually a managing director.\nAssociates do a wide variety of things, including scouting for new\ndeals, helping with due diligence on existing deals, and writing up\nendless internal memos about prospective investments. They are\nalso likely to be the person in the firm who spends the most time\nwith the capitalization table (also known as a cap table), which is\nthe spreadsheet that defines the economics of the deal. Many firms\nhave an associate program, often lasting two years, after which time\nthe associate leaves the firm to go work for a portfolio company, go\nto business school, or start up a company. Occasionally, the star associates go on to become principals.\nAnalysts are at the bottom of the ladder. These are very junior\npeople, usually recently graduated from college, who sit in a room\nwith no windows down the hall from everyone else, crunch numbers,\nand write memos. In some firms, analysts and associates play similar\nwww.itdf.ir\n8 Venture Deals\nroles and have similar functions; in others, the associates are more\ndeal-centric. Regardless, analysts are generally smart people who are\nusually very limited in power and responsibility.\nSome firms, especially larger ones, have a variety of venture partners or operating partners. These are experienced entrepreneurs who\nhave a part-time relationship with the VC firms. While they have\nthe ability to sponsor a deal, they often need explicit support of\none of the MDs, just as a principal would, in order to get a deal\ndone. In some firms, operating partners don’t sponsor deals, but\ntake an active role in managing the investment as a chairman or\nboard member.\nEntrepreneurs in residence (EIRs) are another type of part-time\nmember of the VC firm. EIRs are experienced entrepreneurs who\npark themselves at a VC firm while they are working on figuring out\ntheir next company. They often help the VC with introductions, due\ndiligence, and networking during the 3- to 12-month period that\nthey are an EIR. Some VCs pay their EIRs; others simply provide\nthem with free office space and an implicit agreement to invest in\ntheir next company.\nIn small firms, you might be dealing only with MDs. For example, in our firm, Foundry Group, we have a total of five partners, all\ncalled managing directors, each of whom has the same responsibility, authority, and power. In large firms, you’ll be dealing with a wide\narray of MDs, principals, associates, analysts, venture partners, operating partners, EIRs, and other titles. Since we wrote the first edition\nof this book in 2011, there has been a huge amount of title inflation\namong VC firms as what was referred to as an associate in 2011 might\nnow be referred to as a partner.\nEntrepreneurs should do their research on the firms they are\ntalking to in order to understand who they are talking to, what\ndecision-making power that person has, and what processes they\nhave to go through to get an investment approved. The best\nsources for this kind of information are other entrepreneurs who\nhave worked with the VC firm in the past, although you’d also be\nsurprised how much of this you can piece together just by looking at how a VC firm presents itself on its website. If all else fails,\nyou can always ask the VC how things work, although the further\ndown the hierarchy of the firm they are, the less likely you’ll get\ncompletely accurate information.\nwww.itdf.ir\nthe players  9\n Financing round Nomenclature\n Aside from the humans who work at a venture fi rm, there are also\ndifferent types of venture fi rms. Understanding the different types of\nfi rms will help you target the right ones as you are raising a fi nancing.\n Most fi rms defi ne themselves by the stage of fi nancing they invest\nin. You’ve probably heard of different letters associated with fi nancing rounds: Series A, Series B, Series B Prime, Series G, Series Seed,\nand even Series Pre-Seed. You’ll hear about Series B-2 rounds and\nSeries D-3 rounds. As funding cycles change, you’ll hear about “The\nSeries A Crunch” or “The Series B Crunch,” or even the notion that\n“The Series A is the new Series B.”\n There is no magic or legal defi nition in naming rounds. We’d\nprefer to name them after different hiking trails in Boulder, but we’d\nconfuse too many people, so we stick to letters. It used to be that\nthe Series A round was the fi rst fi nancing, the Series B was the next\nround, and the Series C was the next round. After the Series C often\ncame the Series D. You get the picture.\n At some point, investors who were making very early-stage investments, also referred to as seed rounds, decided that there needed be\na letter before “A” and started to call those deals Series Seed . While we\nhave always felt it was perfectly reasonable to call these seed rounds\na Series A, this emerged around the time that there was a new wave\nof VC fi rms making seed investments, while at the same time many of\nthe fi rms who previously considered themselves early-stage investors\nwere letting these new fi rms make the fi rst investment. The other\nfi rms still liked to refer to themselves as early-stage investors, so the\nold Series A became the Series Seed and the old Series B started to\nbe called Series A. Today, you’ll occasionally hear of a Pre-Seed Round,\nthe entrepreneur’s perspective\n Managing directors or general partners have the mojo inside venture capital\n\u001f rms. If you have anyone else prospecting you or working on the deal with you\n(associate, senior associate, principal, venture partner, or EIR), treat her with an\nenormous amount of respect, but insist on developing a direct relationship with\nan MD or a GP as well. Anyone other than an MD or a GP is unlikely to be at the\n\u001f rm for the long haul. The MDs and GPs are the ones who matter and who will\nmake decisions about your company.\nwww.itdf.ir\n10 Venture Deals\nwhich is simply an effort to label an earlier round that occurs before\nthe seed round.\nAt the same time, companies didn’t want to have letters that\nextended far into the alphabet. When you are doing your Series K\nround, the first thing a VC wonders is “what is wrong with you?”\nSince an increasing number of rounds were inheriting the same\nterms, either at the same or different price as the earlier round, one\nstarted getting numerical round extensions. When the same investors who invested $10 million in a Series B added on another $5\nmillion to the company on the same terms, this became the Series\nB-1. If another $5 million was invested in the company at the same\nterms, this became the Series B-2. When a new investor led the next\n$22 million financing, this finally became the Series C, instead of the\nSeries E, which is what it would have been if the B-1 were the C and\nthe B-2 were the D.\nWhile the labeling of rounds can be complicated, what is important is that there is a language to discuss how early or late stage a\ncompany is when determining what VC might be right for you. Generally, Pre-Seed, Seed, and Series A are early-stage companies, Series\nB and C are mid-stage companies, and Series D or later is a late-stage\ncompany.\nypes of Venture Capital Firms\nNow that we’ve got the nomenclature of rounds down, we can talk\nabout which types of firms invest in which rounds.\nA micro VC fund is a small venture firm that often has only one\ngeneral partner. Many of these folks started out as angel investors,\nwhich we will talk about in the next section, and, after some success,\ncreated a fund to invest other people’s money alongside their own.\nSizes of these funds can vary, but are usually less than $15 million in\ntotal capital per fund. These firms almost exclusively invest at the\nseed and early stages, often alongside other micro VC firms, angel\ninvestors, and friend and family investors.\nSeed-stage funds are generally bigger than micro VCs and can\nscale up to $150 million per fund. They focus on being the first\ninstitutional money into a company and rarely invest in later rounds\npast a Series A. Seed-stage funds often provide your first noncompany board member, so be thoughtful as this relationship goes well\nbeyond just the investment.\nwww.itdf.ir\nhe layers  11\nNext up are the early-stage funds. These are the funds that are\ngenerally $100 million to $300 million in size and invest in seed\nstage and Series A companies but occasionally lead a Series B round.\nThese firms also often continue to invest later in the life of a company, often taking their pro rata in subsequent rounds, which we’ll\nexplain later in this book.\nMid-stage funds are those that generally invest in Series B and\nlater rounds. The funds are often called growth investors, as their first\ninvestment in a company is at a point where a company is clearly\nworking, but now needs capital to accelerate, or continue, its growth.\nThese funds usually range from $200 million to $1 billion in size.\nLate-stage funds enter the picture when the company is now a successful stand-alone business, typically doing its last financing before\na prospective initial public offering (IPO). These include specific\nlate-stage VC funds, but also can be hedge funds, crossover investors that invest primarily in the public markets, funds associated with\nlarge banks, or sovereign wealth funds.\nLike all things in the VC world, you can’t categorize each firm\ntightly. Some firms with billion-dollar funds have early-stage programs\nthat invest in young companies. Some firms have multiple funds that\ninvest in different stages of a company, like we do at Foundry Group.\nWe have early-stage funds that invest in the early stages (seed, A, and\nB) and later-stage funds (which we call Foundry Group Select and\nFoundry Group Next) that invest in growth rounds, similar to what\na mid-stage firm would do. Some firms have dedicated programs or\npartners per stage and others invest along the company life cycle\nwith no special delineations.\nUltimately, the key is to make sure that you are targeting the\ntypes of firms that invest in your stage of company. One of the most\ncommon mistakes entrepreneurs make is focusing on firms that are\nirrelevant for them at the stage they are at.\nhe ngel Investor\nIn addition to VCs, your investor group may include individual investors, usually referred to as angel investors (or angels for short). These\nangels are often a key source of early-stage investment and are very\nactive in the first round of investment, or the seed stage. Angels can\nbe professional investors, successful entrepreneurs, friends, or family members.\nwww.itdf.ir\n12 Venture Deals\nMany VCs are very comfortable investing alongside angels and\noften encourage their active involvement early in the life of a company. As a result, the angels are an important part of any financing dance. However, not all angels are created equal, nor do all VCs\nshare the same view of angels.\nWhile angels will invest at various points in time, they usually\ninvest in the early rounds and often don’t participate in future\nrounds. In cases where everything is going well, this is rarely an issue.\nHowever, if the company hits some speed bumps and has a difficult\nfinancing, the angels’ participation in future rounds may come into\nquestion. Some of the terms we discuss in the book, such as pay-toplay and drag-along rights, are specifically designed to help the VCs\nforce a certain type of behavior on the angels (and other VC investors) in these difficult financing rounds.\nWhile angel investors are usually high-net-worth individuals, they\naren’t always. There are specific Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules around accredited investors, and you should make\nsure that each of your angel investors qualifies as an accredited investor or has an appropriate exemption. This has become more complicated with the passage of the JOBS Act in 2012, and we’ll discuss this\nfurther in Chapter 9, “Crowdfunding.” The best way to ensure you\nare following the rules correctly is to ask your lawyer for help.\nSome angel investors make a lot of small investments. These very\nactive, or promiscuous, angels are called super angels. These super\nangels are often experienced entrepreneurs who have had one or\nmore exits and have decided to invest their own money in new startups. In most cases, super angels are well known in entrepreneurial\ncircles and are often a huge help to early-stage companies.\nAs super angels make more investments, they often decide to\nraise capital from their friends, other entrepreneurs, or institutions.\nAt this point the super angel raises a fund similar to a VC fund and\nbecomes a micro VC. While these micro VCs often want to be thought\nof as angels instead of VCs, once they’ve raised money from other\npeople, they have the same fiduciary responsibility to their investors\nthat a VC has, and as a result they are really just VCs.\nIt’s important to remember that there isn’t a generic angel investor archetype (nor is there a generic VC archetype). Lumping them\ntogether and referring to them as a single group can be dangerous.\nNever assume any of these people are like one another. They will all\nhave their own incentives, pressures, experiences, and sophistication\nwww.itdf.ir\nthe players  13\nthe Syndicate\n While some VCs invest alone, many invest with other VCs. A collection of investors is called a syndicate .\n When VCs refer to the syndicate, they are often talking about\nthe major participants in the fi nancing round, which are usually but\nnot always VCs. The syndicate includes any investor, whether a VC,\nangel, super angel, strategic investor, corporation, law fi rm, or anyone else that ends up purchasing equity in a fi nancing.\n Most syndicates have a lead investor . Usually, but not always, this is\none of the VC investors. Two VCs will often co-lead a syndicate, and\noccasionally you’ll see three co-leads.\n While there is nothing magical about who the lead investor is,\nhaving one often makes it easier for the entrepreneurs to focus their\nenergy around the negotiation. Rather than having one-off negotiations with each investor, the lead in the syndicate will often take the\nrole of negotiating terms for the entire syndicate.\n Regardless of the lead investor or the structure of the syndicate,\nit is the entrepreneurs’ responsibility to make sure they are communicating with each of the investors in the syndicate. As the entrepreneur, even though the lead investor may help corral the other\ninvestors through the process, don’t assume that you don’t need to\ncommunicate with each of the investors—you do!\n Be careful of too many cooks in the kitchen. In the past few years,\nthe idea of a party round, where many investors make relatively small\nthe entrepreneur’s perspective\n Don’t put yourself in a position where you can be held hostage by angels. They\nare important, but they are rarely in a position to determine the company’s direction. If your angel group is a small, diffuse list of friends and family, consider\nsetting up a special-purpose limited partnership controlled by one of them as a\nvehicle for them to invest. Chasing down 75 signatures when you want to do a\n\u001f nancing or sell the company is not fun.\n Also, true friends and family need special care. Make sure they understand up front that (1) they should think of their investment as a lottery ticket,\nand (2) every holiday or birthday party is not an investor relations meeting.\nlevels. Their individual characteristics will often defi ne your working\nrelationship with them well beyond any terms that you negotiate.\nwww.itdf.ir\n14 Venture Deals\nthe Lawyer\n Ah, the lawyers—I bet you thought we’d never get to them. In deals,\na great lawyer can be a huge help and a bad lawyer can be a disaster.\n For the entrepreneur, an experienced lawyer who understands\nVC fi nancings is invaluable. VCs make investments all the time.\nEntrepreneurs raise money occasionally. Even a very experienced\nentrepreneur runs the risk of getting hung up on a nuance that a VC\nhas thought through many times.\n In addition to helping negotiate, a great lawyer can focus the\nentrepreneur on what really matters. While this book will cover all\nthe terms that typically come up in a VC fi nancing, we’ll continue to\nrepeat a simple mantra that the real terms that matter are economics\nand control. Yes, annoying VCs will inevitably spend time negotiating for an additional S-3 registration right (an unimportant term\nthat we’ll discuss later), even though the chance it ever comes into\nplay is very slight. This is just life in a negotiation—there are always\nendless tussles over unimportant points, sometimes due to silly reasons, but they are often used as a negotiating strategy to distract you\nfrom the main show. VCs are experts at this; a great lawyer can keep\nyou from falling into these traps.\nthe entrepreneur’s perspective\n While you should communicate with all investors, you should insist that investors agree (at least verbally) that the lead investor can speak for the whole\nsyndicate when it comes to investment terms. You should not let yourself be in\na position where you have to negotiate the same deal multiple times. If there is\ndissension in the ranks, ask the lead investor for help.\ninvestments at the early stage, has become popular. It isn’t unusual\nto see a $2 million seed round with 10 VCs and 20 angel investors in\nthe round. While it might seem nice to have all these fancy names in\na press release, the entrepreneurs get very little attention from any\nof the investors since their investments were all tiny relative to what\nthe VCs normally invest. As companies raise their next round, they\nrealize they have the worst of all possible worlds—lots of VCs who are\ninvestors, but none who are committed in a meaningful way.\nwww.itdf.ir\nthe players  15\n While lawyers usually bill by the hour, many lawyers experienced\nwith VC investments will cap their fees in advance of the deal. As of\nthis writing in 2016, an early-stage fi nancing can be done for between\n$5,000 and $20,000 and a typical mid- to late-stage fi nancing can be\ncompleted for between $20,000 and $40,000. Lawyers in large cities\ntend to charge more, and if your company has any items to clean up\nfrom your past, your costs will increase.\n If your lawyers and the VC lawyers don’t get along, your bill can\nskyrocket if you don’t stay involved in the process. If the lawyers are\nunwilling to agree to a modest fee cap, you should question whether\nthey know what they are doing.\n In case you are curious, these numbers are virtually unchanged\nfrom a decade ago while billable rates have more than doubled in\nthe same time. What this means is that document standardization is\nthe entrepreneur’s perspective\n At the same time that you don’t want an inexperienced lawyer creating unnecessary tension in the negotiation, don’t let a VC talk you out of using your lawyer\nof choice just because that lawyer isn’t from a nationally known \u001f rm or the\nlawyer rubs the VC the wrong way. This is your lawyer, not your VC’s lawyer.\nThat said, to do this well, you need to be close enough to the communication\nto make sure your lawyer is being reasonable and communicating clearly and\nin a friendly manner.\n However, a bad lawyer, or one inexperienced in VC fi nancings,\ncan do you a world of harm. In addition to getting outnegotiated,\nthe inexperienced lawyer will focus on the wrong issues, fi ght hard\non things that don’t matter, and run up the bill on both sides. We’ve\nencountered this numerous times. Whenever an entrepreneur wants\nto use a cousin who is a divorce lawyer, we take an aggressive position before we start negotiating that the entrepreneur needs a lawyer\nwho has a clue.\n Never forget that your lawyer is a refl ection on you. Your reputation in the startup ecosystem is important, and a bad or inexperienced lawyer will tarnish it. Furthermore, once the deal is done,\nyou’ll be partners with your investors, so you don’t want a bad or inexperienced lawyer creating unnecessary tension in the fi nancing negotiation that will carry over once you are partners with your investors.\nwww.itdf.ir\n16 Venture Deals\nthe Mentor\n Every entrepreneur should have a stable of experienced mentors .\nThese mentors can be hugely useful in any fi nancing, especially if\nthey know the VCs involved.\n We like to refer to these folks as mentors instead of advisers\nsince the word adviser often implies that there is some sort of fee\nagreement with the company. It’s unusual for a company, especially an early-stage one, to have a fee arrangement with an adviser\naround a fi nancing. Nonetheless, there are advisers who prey on\nentrepreneurs by showing up, offering to help raise money, and\nthen asking for compensation by taking a cut of the deal. There\nare even some bold advisers who ask for a retainer relationship to\nhelp out. We encourage early-stage entrepreneurs to stay away from\nthese advisers.\n In contrast, mentors help the entrepreneurs, especially earlystage ones, primarily because someone once helped them. Many\nmentors end up being early angel investors in companies or get a\nsmall equity grant for serving on the board of directors or board of\nadvisers, but they rarely ask for anything up front.\n While having mentors is never required, we strongly encourage\nentrepreneurs to fi nd them, work with them, and build long-term\nrelationships with them. The benefi ts are enormous and often surprising. Most great mentors we know do it because they enjoy it.\nWhen this is the motivation, you often see some great relationships\ndevelop.\nthe entrepreneur’s perspective\n Don’t be shy about insisting that your lawyer cap their fee at a modest number\nor even that the lawyer will only get paid out of the proceeds of a deal. There’s\nno reason, if you are a solid entrepreneur with a good business, that even a toptier law \u001f rm won’t take your unpaid deal to its executive committee as a \u001e ier to\nbe paid on closing.\na reality, but it also means that the average lawyer spends less time\nper deal than in ancient times (the 1990s). Once again, the entrepreneur must take responsibility for the fi nal results.\nwww.itdf.ir\nthe players  17\nthe entrepreneur’s perspective\n Mentors are great. There’s no reason not to give someone a small success fee\nif they truly help you raise money (random email introductions to a VC they met\nonce at a cocktail party don’t count). Sometimes it will make sense to compensate mentors with options as long as you have some control over the vesting\nof the options based on your satisfaction with the mentor’s performance as an\nongoing adviser.\nwww.itdf.ir\n19\n2\nChapter\now to aise Money \nYour goal when you are raising financing should be to get several\nterm sheets. While we have plenty of suggestions, there is no single\nway to do this, as financings come together in lots of different ways\nand can be attributed to an outstanding strategy or just plain old\ngood luck. Venture capitalists (VCs) are not a homogeneous group;\nwhat might impress one VC might turn off another. Although we\nknow what works for us and for our firm, each firm is different, so\nmake sure you know who you are dealing with, what their approach\nis, and what kind of material they need during the fundraising\nprocess. Following are some basic but by no means complete rules of\nthe road, along with some things that you shouldn’t do.\nDo or Do Not—here Is No ry\nIn addition to being a small, green, hairy puppet, Yoda was a wise\nman. His seminal statement to young Luke Skywalker is one we\nbelieve every entrepreneur should internalize before hitting the fundraising trail. You must have the mind-set that you will succeed on\nyour quest.\nWhen we meet people who say they are “trying to raise money,”\n“testing the waters,” or “exploring different options,” this not only\nis a turnoff but also often shows they’ve not had much success. Start\nwith an attitude of presuming success. If you don’t, investors will\nsmell this uncertainty on you; it’ll permeate your words and actions.\nNot all entrepreneurs will succeed when they go out to raise\na financing. Failure is a key part of entrepreneurship, but, as with\nVenture Deals: Be Smarter than Your Lawyer\nand Venture Capitalist, Third Edition\nBy Brad Feld and Jason Mendelson\nCopyright © 2016 by Brad Feld and Jason Mendelson\nwww.itdf.ir\n20 Venture Deals\nmany things in life, attitude impacts outcome and this is one of\nthose cases.\nNote that this advice does not pertain to informal meetings with\ninvestors about what you are doing. We meet with plenty of entrepreneurs who aren’t raising money just to get to know them. However,\nas soon as the switch flips to an active fundraising process, you must\nbe all in.\nDetermine ow Much You re aising\nBefore you hit the road, figure out how much money you are going\nto raise. This will impact your choice of those you speak to in the\nprocess. For instance, if you are raising a $500,000 seed round, you’ll\ntalk to angel investors, seed-stage VCs, super angels, micro VCs, and\nearly-stage investors, including ones from very large VC funds. However, if you are going out to raise $10 million, you should start with\nlarger VC firms since you’ll need a lead investor who can write at\nleast a $5 million check.\nWhile you can create complex financial models that determine\nthat you need a specific amount of capital down to the penny to\nbecome cash flow positive, we know one thing with complete certainty: these models will be wrong. Instead, focus on a length of\ntime you want to fund your company to get to the next meaningful\nmilestone. If you are just starting out, how long will it take you to\nship your first product? If you have a product in the market, how\nlong will it take to get to a certain number of users or a specific\nrevenue amount? Then, assuming no revenue growth; what is your\nmonthly spend, also known as burn rate, that you need to get to this\npoint? If you are starting out and think it’ll take six months to get a\nproduct to market with a team of eight people, you can quickly estimate that you’ll spend around $100,000 per month for six months.\nGive yourself some time cushion (say, a year) and raise $1 million,\nsince it’ll take you a few months to ramp up to a $100,000-per-month\nburn rate.\nThe length of time you need varies dramatically by business. In a\nseed stage software company, you should be able to make real progress in around a year. If you are trying to get a drug approved by\nthe Food and Drug Administration (FDA), you’ll need at least several years. Don’t obsess about getting this exactly right—as with your\nfinancial model, it’s likely wrong (or approximate at best). Just make\nwww.itdf.ir\now to aise Money  21\nsure you have enough cash to get to a clear point of demonstrable\nsuccess. That said, be careful not to overspecify the milestones that\nyou are going to achieve—you don’t want them showing up in your\nfinancing documents as specific milestones that you have to attain.\nBe careful not to go out asking for an amount that is larger than\nyou need, since one of the worst positions you can be in during a\nfinancing is to have investors interested, but be too far short of your\ngoal. For example, assume you are a seed-stage company that needs\n$500,000 but you go out looking for $1 million. One of the questions\nthat the VCs and angels you meet with will probably ask you is: “How\nmuch money do you have committed to the round?” If you answer\nwith “I have $250,000 committed,” a typical angel may feel you’re\nnever going to get there and will hold back on engaging just based\non the status of your financing. However, being able to say “I’m at\n$400,000 on a $500,000 raise and we’ve got room for one or two\nmore investors” is a powerful statement to a prospective angel investor since most investors love to be part of an oversubscribed round.\nFinally, we don’t believe in ranges in the fundraising process.\nWhen someone says they are raising $5 million to $7 million, our\nfirst question is: “Is it $5 million or $7 million?” Though it might\nfeel comfortable to offer up a range in case you can’t get to the high\nend of it, presumably you want to raise at least the low number. The\nrange makes it appear like you are hedging your bets or that you\nhaven’t thought hard about how much money you actually need to\nraise. Instead, we always recommend stating that you are raising a\nspecific number. If you end up with more investor demand than you\ncan handle, you can always raise a larger amount of money.\nAlso keep in mind that the difference between $5 million and $7\nmillion might not sound like much to you, but it could make all the\ndifference in the world to the VC you are speaking to. If the largest\nfirst check a VC writes is $3 million, then a $5 million round means\nthey can be the lead investor. However, in a $7 million round, they\ncan only be a co-lead or a follower. While you should never change\nthe amount of money you are raising to entice a VC, keep in mind\nthat having a range makes your targeting and conversations murkier.\nFundraising Materials\nWhile the exact fundraising materials you will need can vary widely\nby VC, there are a few basic things that you should create before you\nwww.itdf.ir\n22 Venture Deals\nhit the fundraising trail. At the minimum, you need a short description of your business, an executive summary, and a presentation that is\noften not so fondly referred to as “a PowerPoint” despite the fact that\nmany of us are using Google Docs these days. Some investors will\nask for a business plan or a private placement memorandum; this is\nmore common in later-stage investments.\nOnce upon a time, physical form seemed to matter. In the\n1980s, elaborate business plans were professionally printed at the\ncorner copy shop and mailed out. Today, virtually all materials\nare sent via email. Quality still matters a lot, but it’s usually in substance with appropriate form. Don’t overdesign your information—\nwe can’t tell you the number of times we’ve received a highly stylized executive summary that was organized in such a way as to be\nvisually appealing, yet completely lacking in substance. Focus on\nthe content while making the presentation solid and able to stand\non its own.\nWhatever you send us must be clear, concise, interesting, and\neasy for us to process alone early in the morning in the darkness of\nour office at home. If you need to talk us through it, you have lost\nthe battle before you’ve started. Do not make the common mistake\nof thinking that you’ll send us a teaser and then get to talk through\nthe details at a meeting. Realize that whatever you send a VC is often\nboth your first and last impression, so make it count.\nFinally, while never required, many investors (such as us) respond\nto things we can play with, so even if you are a very early-stage company, a prototype or demo is desirable.\nShort Description of Your Business\nYou’ll need a few paragraphs that you can email, often called the\nelevator pitch, meaning you should be able to give it during the length\nof time it takes for an elevator to go from the first floor to your prospective investor’s office. Don’t confuse this with the executive summary, which we discuss next; rather, this is one to three paragraphs\nthat describe the product, the team, and the business very directly. It\ndoesn’t need to be a separate document that you attach to an email;\nthis is the bulk of the email, often wrapped with an introductory\nparagraph, especially if you know the person or are being referred\nto the person, and a concluding paragraph with a very clear request\nfor whatever next step you want.\nwww.itdf.ir\now to aise Money  23\nExecutive Summary\nThe executive summary is a one- to three-page description of your\nidea, product, team, and business. It’s a short, concise, well-written\ndocument that is the first substantive document and interaction\nyou’ll likely have with a prospective investor with whom you don’t\nhave a preexisting relationship. Think of the executive summary as\nthe basis for your first impression and expect it to be passed around\nwithin a VC firm if there’s any interest in what you are doing.\nWork hard on the executive summary—the more substance you\ncan pack into this short document, the more a VC will believe that\nyou have thought critically about your business. It also is a direct\nindication of your communication skills. A poorly written summary\nthat leaves out key pieces of information will cause the VC to assume\nthat you haven’t thought deeply about some important issues or that\nyou are trying to hide bad facts about the business. Our inner grammar nerds suggest you have someone not involved in your company\nproofread your materials.\nIn the executive summary, include the problem you are solving\nand why it’s important to solve. Explain why your product is awesome, why it’s better than what currently exists, and why your team is\nthe right one to pursue it. End with some high-level financial data to\nshow that you have aggressive but sensible expectations about how\nyour business will perform over time.\nYour first communication with a VC is often an introductory\nemail, either from you or from someone referring you to the VC,\nthat is a combination of the short description of your business along\nwith the executive summary attached to the email. If your first interaction was a face-to-face meeting either at a conference, at a coffee\nshop, or in an elevator, if a VC is interested he’ll often say something\nlike “Can you send me an executive summary?” Do this the same day\nthat it is requested of you to start to build momentum to the next\nstep in the process.\nPresentation\nOnce you’ve engaged with a VC firm, you’ll quickly be asked either to\ngive or to email a presentation. This is usually a 10- to 20-page PowerPoint presentation consisting of a substantive overview of your business. There are many different presentation styles and approaches,\nand what you need will depend on the audience (one person, a VC\nwww.itdf.ir\n24 Venture Deals\npartnership, or 500 people at an investor day type of event). Your\ngoal with the presentation is to communicate the same information\nas the executive summary, but using a visual presentation.\n Over time, a number of different presentation styles have\nemerged. A three-minute presentation at a local pitch event is just as\ndifferent from an eight-minute presentation at an accelerator ’s investor day as it is from a 30-minute presentation to a VC partnership.\nRecognize your audience and tune your presentation to them. Realize also that the deck you email as an overview can be different from\nthe one you present, even if you are covering similar material.\n Work hard on the presentation fl ow and format. In this case,\nform matters a great deal—it’s amazing how much more positive\na response is to well-designed and well-organized slides, especially\nif you have a consumer-facing product where user experience will\nmatter a lot for its success. If you don’t have a good designer on\nyour team, fi nd a freelance designer to help you turn your presentation into something visually appealing. This is especially true\nif you are creating a consumer-facing product. If you can’t create good-looking slides, how are you going to create a killer user\nexperience? Put some extra effort into this—it will pay off many\ntimes over.\nthe entrepreneur’s perspective\n “Less is more” when it comes to an investor presentation. There are only a few\nkey things most VCs look at to understand and get excited about a deal: the\nproblem you are solving, the size of the opportunity, the strength of the team, the\nlevel of competition or competitive advantage that you have, your plan of attack,\nand current status. Summary \u001f nancials, use of proceeds, and milestones are\nalso important. Most good investor presentations can be done in 10 slides\nor fewer.\nBusiness Plan\n We haven’t read a business plan in over 20 years. Sure, we still get\nplenty of them, but it is not something we care about as we invest in\nareas we know well, and as a result we much prefer demos and live\ninteractions. Fortunately, most business plans arrive in email these\ndays, so they are easy enough to ignore since one doesn’t have to\nphysically touch them. However, realize that some VCs care a lot\nwww.itdf.ir\now to aise Money  25\nabout seeing a business plan, regardless of the current view by many\npeople that a business plan is an obsolete document.\nThe business plan is usually a 30-page-plus document that has\nall sorts of sections and is something you would learn to write if you\nwent to business school. It goes into great detail about all facets of\nthe business, expanding on the executive summary to have comprehensive sections about the market, product, target customer, go-tomarket strategy, team, and financials.\nWhile we think business plans prepared specifically for fundraising are a waste of time, we still believe that they are valuable documents for entrepreneurs to write while they are formulating their\nbusinesses. There are lots of different approaches today, including\nmany that are user- or customer-centric, but the discipline of writing\ndown what you are thinking, your hypotheses about your business,\nand what you believe will happen is still very useful.\nNow, we aren’t talking about a conventional business plan,\nalthough this can be a useful approach. If you are a software company, consider some variant of the Lean Startup methodology that\nincludes the creation, launch, and testing of a minimum viable product as a starting point. Instead of writing an extensive document, use\nPowerPoint to organize your thoughts into clear sections, although\nrecognize that this is very different from the presentation you are\ngoing to give potential investors.\nYou will occasionally be asked for a business plan. Be prepared\nfor this and know how you plan to respond, along with what you will\nprovide, if and when this comes up.\nPrivate Placement Memorandum\nA private placement memorandum (PPM) is essentially a traditional business plan wrapped in legal disclaimers that are often as long as the\nplan itself. It’s time consuming and expensive to prepare, and you\nget the privilege of paying lawyers thousands of dollars to proofread\nthe document and provide a bunch of legal boilerplate to ensure\nyou don’t say anything that you could get sued for later.\nNormally, PPMs are generated only when investment bankers are\ninvolved and are fundraising from large entities, banks, or late-stage\ninvestors that demand a PPM. In the past few years, bankers have\noften shifted to PowerPoint-type presentations with endless bullet\npoints, instead of prose, because they are easier to create and likely\neasier to consume.\nwww.itdf.ir\n26 Venture Deals\nWe’ve seen plenty of early-stage companies hire bankers and\ndraft PPMs. To us, this is a waste of money and time. When we see an\nemail from a banker sending us a PPM for an early-stage company,\nwe automatically know that investment opportunity isn’t for us and\nalmost always toss it in the circular file.\nOur view is that if an early-stage company has hired a banker to\nhelp with fundraising, either it has been unsuccessful in its attempt\nto raise money and is hoping the banker can help it in a last-ditch\neffort or it is getting bad advice from its advisers (who may be the\nones making a fee from marketing the deal via the PPM). While\nmany later-stage investors like to look at all the stuff they get from\ninvestment bankers, we think this is a pretty weak approach for an\nearly-stage company.\nDetailed Financial Model\nThe only thing that we know about financial predictions of startups\nis that 100 percent of them are wrong. If you can predict the future\naccurately, we have a few suggestions for other things you could be\ndoing besides starting a risky early-stage company. Furthermore, the\nearlier stage the startup, the less accurate any predications will be.\nWhile we know you can’t predict your revenue with any degree of\naccuracy (although we are always very pleased in that rare case where\nrevenue starts earlier and grows faster than expected), the expense\nside of your financial plan is very instructive as to how you think\nabout the business.\nYou can’t predict your revenue with any level of precision, but you\nshould be able to manage your expenses exactly to plan. Your financials will mean different things to different investors. In our case,\nwe focus on two things: (1) the assumptions underlying the revenue\nforecast (which we don’t need a spreadsheet for—we’d rather just\ntalk about them) and (2) the monthly burn rate or cash consumption of the business. Since your revenue forecast will be wrong, your\ncash flow forecast will be wrong. However, if you are an effective manager, you’ll know how to budget for this by focusing on lagging your\nincrease in cash spend behind your expected growth in revenue.\nOther VCs are much more spreadsheet driven. Some firms (usually those with associates) may go so far as to perform discounted\ncash flow analyses to determine the value of your business. Some\nwill look at every line item and study it in detail. Others only focus\nwww.itdf.ir\now to aise Money  27\non certain things that matter to them. For instance, what is your\nhead count over the next few quarters, and how fast do you expect\nto acquire users or customers? Although none of us know your business better than you do, VCs will apply their experience and frames\nof reference to your financial model as they evaluate how well you\nunderstand the financial dynamics of your business.\nIn later financing rounds, your company’s historical financial\nperformance, underlying unit economics, cost structure, and future\nfinancial plan will matter a lot more to your prospective VCs. At\nthis point, you’ve been in business for a while. You are now raising\nmoney against your track record and the extrapolation of that into\nthe future, rather than just an idea, a dream, and a fantasy.\nThe Demo\nMost VCs love demos. In the short time before we wrote this section, we got to play with an industrial robot, wear a device that\ntracked anxiety level, interact with software that measured the\nnumber of times we smiled while we watched a video, saw a projection system that worked on curved walls with incredible fidelity,\ngave real blood out of our arms for a new health analysis technology, and played around with a Web service that figured out the\nnews we were interested in based on a new approach to leveraging\nour social graphs. We learned more from the demos, especially\nabout our emotional interest in the products we played with, than\nany document could communicate. Each of these demos also gave\nus a chance to talk directly to the entrepreneurs about how they\nthought about their current and future products, and we got a\nclear view of the enthusiasm and obsession of the entrepreneurs\nfor what they are working on.\nWe believe the demo, a prototype, or an alpha is far more important than a business plan or financial model for a very early-stage\ncompany. The demo shows us your vision in a way we can interact\nwith. More important, it shows us that you can build something and\nthen show it off. We expect demos to be underfeatured, to be rough\naround the edges, and to crash. We know that you’ll probably throw\naway the demo on the way to a final product and what we are investing in will evolve a lot. But like many 14-year-olds, we just want to play.\nDemos are just as important in existing companies. If you have\na complex product, figure out a way to show it off in a short period\nwww.itdf.ir\n28 Venture Deals\nof time. We don’t need to see every feature; use your demo to tell us\na story about the problem your product addresses. And give us the\nsteering wheel—we want to play with the demo, not just be passive\nobservers. While we are playing, watch us carefully because you’ll\nlearn an enormous amount about us in that brief period of time\nwhile you see how comfortable we are, whether our eyes light up,\nand whether we really understand what you are pursuing.\nDue Diligence Materials\nAs you go further down the financing path, VCs will ask for additional information. If a VC offers you a term sheet, expect their lawyers to ask you for a bunch of things such as capitalization tables,\ncontracts, material agreements, employment agreements, and board\nmeeting minutes. The list of documents requested during the formal due diligence process (usually after signing of the term sheet,\nbut not always) can be long. For an example, see the “Resources”\npage at www.venturedeals.com. The number of documents you will\nactually have depends on how long you have been in business. Even\nif you are a young company just starting up, we recommend that\nbefore you go out to raise money, you organize all of these documents for quick delivery to a potential funding partner so you don’t\nslow down the process when they ask for them.\nYou should never try to hide anything with any of these fundraising materials. Although you are trying to present your company in\nthe best light possible, you want to make sure any issues you have are\nclearly disclosed. Deal with any messy stuff up front. If a VC forgets\nto ask for something early on, assume you will be asked for it before\nthe deal is done. If you happen to get something past a VC and get\nfunded, it will eventually come out that you weren’t completely transparent and your relationship will suffer. A good VC will respect full\ndisclosure early on and, if they are interested in working with you,\nwill actively engage to help you get through any challenges you have,\nor at least give you feedback on why there are showstoppers that you\nhave to clear up before you raise money.\nFinding the ight VC\nThe best way to find the perfect VC is to ask your friends and other\nentrepreneurs. They can give you unfiltered data about which VCs\nwww.itdf.ir\now to aise Money  29\nthey’ve enjoyed working with and who have helped build their businesses. It’s also the most efficient approach, since an introduction\nto a VC from an entrepreneur who knows both you and the VC is\nalways more effective than you sending a cold email to vcname@\nvcfirm.com.\nBut what should you do if you don’t have a large network for\nthis? Back in the early days of venture capital, it was very hard to\nlocate even the contact information for a VC, and you rarely found\nthem in the yellow pages, not even next to the folks who give payday\nloans. Today, VCs have websites and blogs, tweet endlessly, and even\nlist their email addresses on their websites.\nEntrepreneurs can discover a lot of information about their\npotential future VC partners, well beyond the mundane contact\ninformation. You’ll be able to discover what types of companies\nthey invest in, what stage of growth they prefer to invest in, past successes, failures, approaches, and strategies (at least their marketing\napproaches), and bios on the key personnel at the firm.\nIf the VC has a social media presence, you’ll be able to take all\nof that information and infer things like their hobbies, theories on\ninvesting, beer they drink, instruments they play, and type of building or facility—such as a bathroom—they like to endow at their local\nuniversities. If you follow them on Foursquare, you can even figure\nout what kind of food they like to eat.\nWhile it may seem obvious, engaging a VC that you don’t know\nvia social media can be useful as a starting point to develop a relationship. In addition to the ego gratification of having a lot of Twitter followers (hint: now is the time to follow @jasonmendelson and\n@bfeld if you aren’t already), you’ll start to develop an impression\nand, more importantly, a relationship if you comment thoughtfully\non blog posts the VC writes. It doesn’t have to be all business—\nengage at a personal level, offer suggestions, interact, and follow the\nbest rule of developing relationships: “give more than you get.” And\nnever forget the simple notion that if you want money, ask for advice.\nDo your homework. When we get business plans from medical\ntech companies or somebody insisting we sign a nondisclosure agreement (NDA) before we review a business plan, we know that they did\nabsolutely zero research on our firm or us before they sent us the\ninformation. At best, the submission doesn’t rise to the top compared to more thoughtful correspondences, and at worst it doesn’t\neven elicit a response from us.\nwww.itdf.ir\n30 Venture Deals\nA typical VC gets thousands of inquiries a year. The vast majority\nof these requests are from people whom the VC has never met and\nwith whom the VC has no relationship. Improve your chances of\nhaving VCs respond to you by researching them, getting a referral\nto them, and engaging with them in whatever way they seem to be\ninterested in.\nFinally, don’t forget this works both ways. You may have a superhot deal and as a result have your pick of VCs to fund your company.\nDo your homework and find out who will be most helpful to your\nsuccess, has a temperament and style that will be compatible with\nyours, and will ultimately be your best long-term partner. Remember\nthat the average length of a relationship between a VC and founder\nis on par with the average length of a marriage in the United States.\nFinding a Lead VC\nAssuming that you are talking with multiple potential investors, you\ncan generally categorize them into one of three groups: leaders, followers, and everyone else. It’s important to know how to interact\nwith each of these groups. If not, you not only will waste a lot of your\ntime but also might be unsuccessful in your fundraising mission.\nYour goal is to find a lead VC. This is the firm that is going to give\nyou a term sheet, take a leadership role in driving to a financing, and\nlikely be your most active new investor. It’s possible to have co-leads\n(usually two, occasionally three) in a financing. It’s also desirable to\nhave more than one VC competing to lead your deal without them\nknowing who else you are talking to.\nAs you meet with potential VCs, you’ll get one of four typical\nvibes. First is the VC who is clearly interested and wants to lead. Next\nis the VC who isn’t interested and passes. These are the easy ones—\nengage aggressively with the ones who want to lead and don’t worry\nabout the ones who pass.\nThe other two categories—the “maybe” and the “slow no”—are\nthe hardest to deal with. The “maybe” seems interested, but doesn’t\nreally step up his level of engagement. This VC seems to be hanging\naround, waiting to see if there’s any interest in your deal. Keep this person warm by continually meeting and communicating with him, but\nrealize that this VC is not going to catalyze your investment. However,\nas your deal comes together with a lead, this VC is a great one to bring\ninto the mix if you want to put a syndicate of several firms together.\nwww.itdf.ir\now to aise Money  31\nThe “slow no” is the hardest to figure out. These VCs never actually say no, but are completely in react mode. They’ll occasionally\nrespond when you reach out to them, but there is no perceived forward motion on their part. You always feel like you are pushing on\na rope—there’s a little resistance but nothing ever really moves anywhere. We recommend you think of these VCs as a “no” and don’t\ncontinue to spend time with them.\nKeep your head up and stay optimistic throughout the process.\nWe realize how frustrating finding a lead VC can be. We also get\nfrustrated with VCs, who aren’t transparent and deal in maybes and\nact as slow nos. If it makes you feel any better, we face the same thing\nwhen we go out to raise money from our investors. Most of all, learn\nfrom all the feedback you get and don’t take any of it personally.\now VCs Decide to Invest\nLet’s explore how VCs decide to invest in a company and what the\nprocess normally looks like. All VCs are different, so these are generalizations but more or less reflect the way that VCs make their\ndecisions.\nThe way that you get connected to a particular VC affects the\nprocess that you go through. Some VCs will fund only entrepreneurs\nwith whom they have a prior connection. Other VCs prefer to be\nintroduced to entrepreneurs by other VCs. Some VCs invest only in\nseasoned entrepreneurs and avoid working with first-time entrepreneurs, whereas others, like us, will fund entrepreneurs of all ages\nand experience levels and will try to be responsive to anyone who\ncontacts us. Whatever the case is, you should determine quickly if\nyou reached a particular VC through her preferred channel or you\nare swimming upstream from the beginning.\nNext, you should understand the role of the person within the\nVC firm who is your primary connection. If an associate reached out\nto you via email, consider that his job is to scour the universe looking\nfor deals but that the associate probably doesn’t have any real pull to\nget a deal done. It doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t meet with her,\nbut also don’t get overly excited until there is a general partner or\nmanaging director at the firm paying attention to and spending real\ntime with you.\nYour first few interactions with a VC firm will vary widely depending on the firm’s style and who your initial contact is. However, at\nwww.itdf.ir\n32 Venture Deals\nsome point it will be apparent that the VC has more than a passing\ninterest in exploring an investment in you and will begin a process\noften known as due diligence . This isn’t a formal legal or technical\ndiligence; rather, it’s code for “I’m taking my exploration to the\nnext level.”\n You can learn a lot about the attitude and culture of a VC fi rm by\nthe way it conducts its diligence. For example, if you are raising your\nfi rst round of fi nancing and you have no revenue and no product,\na VC who asks for a fi ve-year detailed fi nancial projection and then\nproceeds to hammer you on the numbers is probably not someone\nwho has a lot of experience or comfort making early-stage investments. As mentioned before, we believe the only thing that can be\nknown about a pre-revenue company’s fi nancial projections is that\nthey are wrong.\n During this phase, a VC will ask for a lot of things, such as presentations, projections, customer pipeline or targets, development\nplan, competitive analysis, and team bios. This is all normal. In some\ncases, the VCs will be mellow and accept what you’ve already created\nin anticipation of the fi nancing. In other cases, they’ll make you run\naround like a headless chicken and create a lot of busywork for you.\nIn either case, before you jump through hoops providing this information, make sure a partner-level person (usually a managing director or general partner) is involved and that you aren’t just the object\nof a fi shing expedition by an associate.\nthe entrepreneur’s perspective\n If you feel like your VC is a proctologist, run for the hills.\n While the VC fi rm goes through its diligence process on you, we\nsuggest you return the favor and ask for things like introductions to\nother founders they’ve backed. Nothing is as illuminating as a discussion with other entrepreneurs who’ve worked with your potential\ninvestor. Don’t be afraid to ask for entrepreneurs the VC has backed\nwhose companies haven’t worked out. Since you should expect that\na good VC will ask around about you, don’t be afraid to ask other\nentrepreneurs what they think of the VC.\nwww.itdf.ir\nhow to raise Money  33\n You’ll go through multiple meetings, emails, phone calls, and\nmore meetings. You may meet other members of the fi rm or you may\nnot. You may end up going to the VC’s offi ces to present to the entire\npartnership on a Monday, a tradition known by many fi rms as the\nMonday partner meeting. In other cases, as with our fi rm, if things\nare heating up you’ll meet with each of the partners relatively early\nin the process in one-on-one or group settings.\n As things unfold, either you’ll continue to work with the VC in\nexploring the opportunity or the VC will start slowing down the pace\nof communication. Be very wary of the VC who is hot on your company, then warm, then cold, but never really says no. While some\nVCs are quick to say no when they lose interest, many VCs don’t\nsay no because either they don’t see a reason to, they want to keep\ntheir options open, they are unwilling to affi rmatively pass on a deal\nbecause they don’t want to have to shut the door, or they are just\nplain impolite and disrespectful to the entrepreneur.\n Ultimately, VCs will decide to invest or not invest. If they do, the\nnext step in the process is for them to issue a term sheet.\nthe entrepreneur’s perspective\n The best VCs will give you, either proactively or reactively, a list of all the entrepreneurs they’ve worked with in the past and ask you to pick a few for reference\nchecks. The best reference checks are ones you can do where the company\nwent through hard times, maybe swapped out a founder for another CEO, or\neven failed, as you will learn from these how the VC handled messy and adversarial situations.\nthe entrepreneur’s perspective\n If a VC passes on a deal with you, whether graciously or by not returning your\nemails and your calls, do your best to politely insist on feedback as to why. This\nis one of the most important lessons an entrepreneur can learn and is especially\nuseful during the fundraising cycle. Don’t worry that someone is telling you that\nyour baby is ugly. Ask for the feedback, demand it, get it, absorb it, and learn\nfrom it.\nwww.itdf.ir\n34 Venture Deals\nUsing Multiple VCs to Create Competition\nChoice is power. Having multiple VCs interested in your company\nwill provide insight into how different firms work and give you the\nnegotiation leverage to improve the terms of the deal.\nIf you want to create a competitive process, allow at least six\nmonths to raise money. If you start the process earlier than this, you\nwon’t feel urgency to get a deal done, nor will your prospective investors. If you start with less time, you may not have enough time to get\nthe financing done before you run out of money. A short window to\nget a financing done can lead to many VCs passing since they won’t\nhave enough time to evaluate your company. In other cases, VCs will\nsense desperation when you only have a few months left before running out of money, which doesn’t help your negotiating position.\nAfter you’ve started to engage with a particular VC, make sure\nyou understand their process. A few will tell you, but most won’t.\nAfter you’ve had a second meeting, ask what the process going forward is. While you might get a vague answer, you’ll often get some\nclues as to what the next steps and decision points are.\nTiming is everything. While it is hard enough to get multiple parties interested, you also need to make sure that the timing of each of\ntheir processes line up. It doesn’t do you any good if you get three\nVCs interested in you 18 months apart. If you have a sense of process,\nyou can bias your energy toward the firms with a longer process in an\neffort to synchronize the delivery of term sheets.\nBe careful to understand what a slow process actually means.\nWhile annoying, many VCs have a slow process because they are bad\nat saying no and prefer to string along entrepreneurs to give the VC\nfirm option value in the situation where a deal starts to heat up. If a\nVC is having trouble giving you clear and timely feedback, or is reluctant to be clear in their description, you may be speaking to someone who doesn’t have the power in their firm to get a deal done.\nThat is why we always suggest that you interact, as much as possible,\nwith managing directors and general partners.\nSome VCs will ask you who else you are talking to. If your goal is\nto create a competitive process, never answer this question. If you do,\nthe next email a VC will send is one to someone at the firms you told\nthem you were talking to, asking what they think of you and your deal.\nSometimes this works in your favor, but only in cases where the firms\ncompete fiercely with each other for deals or in situations where firms\nwww.itdf.ir\now to aise Money  35\ncollaborate closely. Either way, it’s better to stay quiet about other\nconversations early on and only make connections between firms that\nare known collaborators as term sheets start to fly.\nDo your homework. Be as strategic in your fundraising as\nyou are with your business. Plan ahead. Talk to everyone you can\nabout which VCs to speak to, and don’t waste your time with those\nwho don’t invest in your stage or sector. Be up front and direct\nand get as much information as you can during the fundraising\nprocess.\nClosing the Deal\nThe most important part of the fundraising process is to close the\ndeal, raise the money, and get back to running your business. How\ndo you actually close the deal?\nSeparate it into two activities: the first is the signing of the term\nsheet and the second is signing the definitive documents and getting\nthe cash. This book is primarily about getting a term sheet signed.\nIn our experience, most executed term sheets result in a financing\nthat closes. Reputable VCs, especially early-stage firms, can’t afford\nto have term sheets signed and then not follow through; otherwise,\nthey don’t remain reputable for long.\nThis can be different for later-stage firms. Often, you’ll agree to\na term sheet, albeit a nonbinding one, but you aren’t done with the\ndeal process yet. Many later-stage firms have a final formal approval\nstep, known as their investment committee, before they actually\nclose a deal. In the past few years, we have seen several cases where\na signed term sheet from the fund wasn’t actually approved by the\ninvestment committee. In these cases, the company and VC proceeded as though the term sheet would lead to a deal and, after lots\nof diligence and legal drafting, the investment committee turned\ndown the deal and the VC walked away, often putting the company\nin a difficult situation.\nThe most likely situations that derail financings are when VCs\nfind unexpected bad facts about the company after term sheet signing. You should assume that a signed term sheet will lead to money\nin the bank as long as there are no smoking guns in your company’s\npast, the investor is a professional one, and you don’t do anything\nstupid in the definitive document drafting process.\nwww.itdf.ir\n36 Venture Deals\nThe second part of closing the deal is the process of drafting\nthe definitive agreements. Generally, the lawyers do most of the\nheavy lifting here. They will take the term sheet and start to negotiate the 100-plus pages of documentation that are generated from\nthe term sheet. In the best-case scenario, you respond to due diligence requests, and one day you are told to sign some documents.\nThe next thing you know, you have money in the bank and a new\nboard member with whom you are excited to work.\nIn the worst case, however, the deal blows up. Or perhaps the deal\ncloses, but there are hard feelings left on both sides. Throughout\nthe process, manage it on a daily basis. Don’t let the lawyers behave\npoorly, as this will only injure the future relationship between you\nand your investor. Make sure that you are responsive with requests,\nand never assume that because your lawyer is angry and says the\nother side is horrible/stupid/evil/worthless that the VC even has a\nclue what is going on. Many times, we’ve seen legal teams get completely tied up on an issue and want to kill each other when neither the entrepreneur nor the VC even cared or had any notion that\nthere was a dustup over the issue. Before you get emotional, make a\nphone call or send an email to the VC and see what the real story is.\nwww.itdf.ir\n37\n 3 C H A P T E R\nOverview of the Term Sheet  \nAt the end of 2005, during the dark ages when venture capital was\nvery much out of favor, we participated in a \u001f nancing that was much\nmore dif\u001f cult than it needed to be. All of the participants were to\nblame, and ignorance of what really mattered in the negotiation\nkept things going much longer than was necessary. We talked about\nwhat to do and, at the risk of giving away super-top-secret venture\ncapital magic tricks, decided to write a blog series on Brad’s blog\n( Feld Thoughts — www.feld.com ) that deconstructed a venture capital\nterm sheet and explained each section.\n That blog series was the inspiration for this book. The next few\nchapters cover the most frequently discussed terms in a venture capital term sheet. Many venture capitalists (VCs) love to negotiate hard\non every term as though the health of their children depended on\nthem getting the terms just right. Sometimes this is inexperience on\nthe part of the VC; often, it’s just a negotiating tactic.\n The speci\u001f c language that we refer to is from actual term sheets.\nIn addition to describing and explaining the speci\u001f c terms, we give\nyou examples of what to focus on and implications from the perspectives of the company, VCs, and entrepreneurs.\nThe Entrepreneur’s Perspective\n The term sheet is critical. What’s in it usually determines the \u001f nal deal structure.\nDon’t think of it as a letter of intent. Think of it as a blueprint for your future\nrelationship with your investor.\nVenture Deals: Be Smarter than Your Lawyer\nand Venture Capitalist, Third Edition\nBy Brad Feld and Jason Mendelson\nCopyright © 2016 by Brad Feld and Jason Mendelson\nwww.itdf.ir\n38 Venture Deals\n The Key Concepts: Economics and Control\n In general, there are only two things that VCs really care about when\nmaking investments: economics and control. Economics refers to the\nreturn the investors will ultimately get in a liquidity event, usually\neither a sale of the company, a wind down, or an initial public offering (IPO), and the terms that have direct impact on this return.\nControl refers to the mechanisms that allow the investors either to\naf\u001f rmatively exercise control over the business or to veto certain\ndecisions the company can make. If you are negotiating a deal and\ninvestors are digging their heels in on a provision that doesn’t impact\nthe economics or control, they are often blowing smoke, rather than\nelucidating substance.\nThe Entrepreneur’s Perspective\n Economics and control are important things to pay attention to, in and of themselves. They rule the day. An inexperienced VC will harp on other terms needlessly. You can give in on them or not, but the mere fact that a VC focuses on\nunimportant terms is a sign of what that VC will be like to work with as an owner,\nboard member, and compensation committee member.\n When companies are created, the founders receive common stock .\nHowever, when VCs invest in companies, they purchase equity and\nin the vast majority of cases receive preferred stock . In the following\nchapters we’ll be referring to terms that the preferred shareholders\nare receiving.\n As we described earlier, separate \u001f nancings are usually referred\nto as a series designated by a letter, such as Series A . The \u001f rst round is\noften called the Series A \u001f nancing, although recently a new round\noccurring before the Series A has appeared, called the Series Seed\n\u001f nancing. The letter is incremented in each subsequent \u001f nancing,\nso Series B \u001f nancings follow Series A, and Series C \u001f nancings follow\nSeries B. You’ll occasionally see a number added onto the letter for\nsubsequent rounds, such as Series A-1 or Series B-2. This is generally\ndone to try to limit how far into the alphabet you go and is often\nused when the same investors do subsequent rounds in a company\ntogether. While we aren’t aware of the world record for number of\n\u001f nancings in a private company, we have seen a Series K \u001f nancing.\n In the following chapters, we walk you through language for\neach term and detailed examples. Let’s get started by exploring the\neconomic terms.\nwww.itdf.ir\n39\n4\nChapter\nconomic erms of the erm Sheet \nWhen discussing the economics of a venture capital deal, one\noften hears the question, “What is the valuation?” While the valuation of a company, determined by multiplying the number of shares\noutstanding by the price per share, is one component of the deal,\nit’s a mistake to focus only on the valuation when considering the\neconomics of a deal.\nIn this chapter we discuss all of the terms that make up the economics of the deal, including price, liquidation preference, pay-toplay, vesting, the employee pool, and antidilution.\nrice\nThe first economic term, and the one most entrepreneurs focus on\nmore than any other, is the price of the deal. Following is the typical\nway price is represented in a term sheet.\nPrice: $ per share (the Original Purchase Price). The Original Purchase Price represents a fully diluted pre-money valuation of $ million and a fully diluted post-money valuation\nof $ million. For purposes of the above calculation and any\nother reference to fully diluted in this term sheet, fully diluted\nassumes the conversion of all outstanding preferred stock of the\nCompany, the exercise of all authorized and currently existing\nstock options and warrants of the Company, and the increase of\nthe Company’s existing option pool by [X] shares prior to this\nfinancing.\nVenture Deals: Be Smarter than Your Lawyer\nand Venture Capitalist, Third Edition\nBy Brad Feld and Jason Mendelson\nCopyright © 2016 by Brad Feld and Jason Mendelson\nwww.itdf.ir\n40 Venture Deals\nA somewhat different way that price can be represented is by\ndefining the amount of the financing, which backs into the price.\nFor example:\nAmount of Financing: An aggregate of $X million, representing\na % ownership position on a fully diluted basis, including\nshares reserved for any employee option pool. Prior to the Closing, the Company will reserve shares of its Common Stock so\nthat % of its fully diluted capital stock following the issuance\nof its Series A Preferred is available for future issuances to directors, officers, employees, and consultants.\nWhile price per share is the ultimate measure of what is being paid\nfor the equity being bought, price is often referred to as valuation.\nThere are two different ways to discuss valuation: pre-money and\npost-money. The pre-money valuation is what the investor is valuing\nthe company at today, before investment, while the post-money valuation is simply the pre-money valuation plus the contemplated aggregate investment amount. With this, you’ve encountered the first trap\nthat venture capitalists (VCs) often lead entrepreneurs into.\nWhen a VC says, “I’ll invest $5 million at a valuation of $20 million,” the VC usually means the post-money valuation. In this situation, the VC’s expectation is that a $5 million investment will buy\n25% of a $20 million post-money company. At the same time, an\nentrepreneur might hear a $5 million investment at a pre-money valuation of $20 million, which would buy only 20% of the $25 million\npost-money company. The words are the same but the expectations\nare very different.\nThe term sheet language usually spells this out in detail. However,\nwhen you are starting the negotiation with the VC, you’ll often have\na verbal discussion about price. How you approach this sets the tone\nfor a lot of the balance of the negotiation. By addressing the ambiguity up front, you demonstrate that you have knowledge about the\nbasic terms. The best entrepreneurs we’ve dealt with are presumptive\nand say something like “I assume you mean $20 million pre-money.”\nThis forces the VC to clarify, and if in fact she did mean $20 million\npre-money, it doesn’t cost you anything in the negotiation.\nThe next part of price to focus on is the phrase fully diluted. Both\nthe company and the investor will want to make sure the company\nhas sufficient equity (or stock options) reserved to compensate and\nwww.itdf.ir\neconomic terms of the term Sheet  41\nmotivate its workforce. This is also known as the employee pool or option\npool . The bigger the pool the better, right? Not so fast. Although a\nlarge option pool will make it easier to give good option packages\nto new hires while it being less likely that the company will run out\nof available options, the size of the pool is taken into account in the\nvaluation of the company. This lowers the actual pre-money valuation and is common valuation trap number two.\n Let’s stay with our previous example of a $5 million investment at\n$20 million pre-money. Assume that you have an existing option pool\nthat has options representing 10% of the outstanding stock reserved\nand unissued. The VCs suggest that they want to see a 20% option\npool. In this case, the extra 10% will come out of the pre-money valuation, resulting in an effective pre-money valuation of $18 million.\n There is no magic number for the option pool, and this is often\na key point of the pricing negotiation. The typical early-stage company option pool ends up in a range of 10% to 20%, with later-stage\ncompanies having smaller option pools. If the investors believe that\nthe option pool of the company should be increased, they will insist\nthat the increase happens prior to the fi nancing.\n You have several negotiating approaches. You can fi ght the pool\nsize, trying to get the VCs to end up at 15% instead of 20%. Or you\ncan negotiate on the pre-money valuation; accept a 20% pool but\nask for a $22 million pre-money valuation. Or you can suggest that\nthe increase in the option pool gets added to the deal post-money,\nwhich will result in the same pre-money valuation but a higher postmoney one.\nthe entrepreneur’s perspective\n VCs will want to minimize their risk of future dilution as much as possible by\nmaking the option pool as large as possible up front. When you have this negotiation, you should come armed with an option budget . List out all of the hires\nyou plan on making between today and your next anticipated \u001f nancing date and\nthe approximate option grant you think it will take to land each one of them. You\nshould be prepared to have an option pool with more options than your budget\ncalls for, but not necessarily by a huge margin. The option budget will be critical\nin this conversation with your potential investor.\n Another economic term that you will encounter, especially in\nlater-stage fi nancings, is warrants associated with fi nancings. As with\nwww.itdf.ir\n42 Venture Deals\nthe stock option pool allocation, this is another way for an investor\nto sneak in a lower valuation for the company. A warrant is similar to\na stock option; it is a right for an investor to purchase a certain number of shares at a predefined price for a certain number of years. For\nexample, a 10-year warrant for 100,000 shares of Series A stock at $1\nper share gives the warrant holder the option to buy 100,000 shares\nof Series A stock at $1 per share anytime in the next decade, regardless of what the stock is worth at the moment in time the investor\navails himself of (or exercises) the warrant.\nWarrants as part of a venture financing, especially in an earlystage investment (where they are rare), tend to create a lot of\nunnecessary complexity and accounting headaches down the road.\nIf the issue is simply one of price, we recommend the entrepreneur\nnegotiate for a lower pre-money valuation to try to eliminate the\nwarrants. Occasionally, this may be at cross purposes with existing\ninvestors who, for some reason, want to artificially inflate the valuation, since the warrant value is rarely calculated as part of the valuation even though it impacts the future allocation of proceeds in a\nliquidity event.\nThere is one type of financing—the bridge loan—in which warrants are commonplace. A bridge loan occurs when an investor is\nplanning to do a financing, but is waiting for additional investors\nto participate. In the bridge loan scenario, the existing investor will\nmake the investment as convertible debt, which will convert into equity\nat the price of the upcoming financing. Since the bridge loan investor took additional risk, he generally gets either a discount on the\nprice of the equity (usually up to 20%) or warrants that effectively\ngrant a discount (again usually up to 20%, although occasionally\nmore). In bridge round cases, it’s not worth fighting these warrants\nas long as they are structured reasonably.\nThe best way to negotiate a higher price is to have multiple VCs\ninterested in investing in your company. This is Economics 101; if\nyou have more demand (VCs interested) than supply (equity in your\ncompany to sell), then price will increase. In early rounds, your new\ninvestors will likely be looking for the lowest possible price that still\nleaves enough equity in the founders’ and employees’ hands. In\nlater rounds, your existing investors will often argue for the highest\nprice for new investors in order to limit the dilution of the existing investors. If there are no new investors interested in investing\nin your company, your existing investors will often argue for a price\nwww.itdf.ir\neconomic terms of the term Sheet  43\n By now you may be wondering how VCs really value companies.\nIt is not an exact science regardless of the number of spreadsheets\ninvolved. VCs typically take into account many factors when deciding\nhow to value a potential investment—some are quantifi able whereas\nothers are completely qualitative. Following are some of the different factors, along with brief explanations of what impacts them.\n ● Stage of the company. Early-stage companies tend to have a valuation range that is determined more by the experience of the\nentrepreneurs, the amount of money being raised, and the\nperception of the overall opportunity. As companies mature,\nthe historical fi nancial performance and future fi nancial projections start to impact valuation. In later-stage companies,\nsupply and demand for the fi nancing combined with fi nancial performance dominate, as investors are beginning to look\ntoward an imminent exit event.\n ● Competition with other funding sources . The simple time-tested\nrule for the entrepreneur is “more is better.” When VCs feel\nthat they are competing with other VCs for a deal, price tends\nto increase. However, a word of caution—don’t overplay competition that doesn’t exist. If you do and get caught, you’ll\ndamage your current negotiating position, potentially lose the\nexisting investor that you have at the table, and, if nothing\nthe entrepreneur’s perspective\n The best Plan A has a great Plan B standing behind it. The more potential investors you have interested in investing in your company, the better your negotiating position is. Spend as much time on your best alternative to a negotiated\nagreement (BATNA) as possible.\nequal to ( fl at round ) or lower than ( down round ) the price of the\nprevious round. Finally, new investors will always argue for the lowest\nprice they think will enable them to get a fi nancing done, given the\nappetite (or lack thereof) of the existing investors for putting more\nmoney into the company. As an entrepreneur, you are faced with\nall of these contradictory motivations in a fi nancing, reinforcing\nthe truism that it is incredibly important to pick your early investors\nwisely, since they can materially help or hurt this process.\nwww.itdf.ir\n44 Venture Deals\nelse, lose all of your leverage in other aspects of the negotiation. Our belief is that you should always negotiate honestly.\nOver representing your situation rarely ends well.\n● Experience of the entrepreneurs and leadership team. The more experienced the entrepreneurs, the less risk, and, correspondingly,\nthe higher the valuation.\n● Size and trendiness of the market. There will be some pricing\ninfluence depending on how large, or trendy, the market is\nthat you are playing in.\n● The VC’s natural entry point. Some VCs are early-stage investors\nand will invest only at low price points. For example, we know\nof one well-known early-stage investor who publicly states the\nintention not to invest at a valuation above $10 million postmoney. Later-stage investors tend to be much less focused on\na specific price level and care more about the specific status\nof the company. While VC firms often have stated strategies,\nit’s often the case that they will diverge from these strategies,\nespecially when markets heat up.\n● Numbers, numbers, numbers. The numbers matter. Whether it is\npast performance; predictions of the future; revenue; earnings\nbefore interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA);\ncash burn; or head count, they each factor into the determination of price. That being said, don’t believe everything your\nMBA professor told you about DCF (discounted cash flow, for\nthose of you without an MBA), especially for early-stage companies. Remember, the only thing you know for sure about your\nfinancial projections at the early stages is that they are wrong.\n● Current economic climate. Though this is out of the control of\nthe entrepreneur, it weighs heavily on pricing. When the\nmacro economy or stock market is in the dumps, valuations\nare lower. When the macro economy is growing quickly, valuations go up. Specifically, valuations often expand when there\nis future optimism forecasted about the macro economy.\nHowever, these events are not tightly correlated, especially in\nthe technology sector.\nRegardless of an investor’s justification for the valuation they are\ngiving you, recognize that it’s a guess stimulated by multiple factors.\nWhile numbers matter more in the later stages, don’t be insulted if\nyour valuation and a VC’s valuation aren’t the same, as each of you\nwww.itdf.ir\neconomic terms of the term Sheet  45\nLiquidation preference\n The liquidation preference is the next most important economic\nterm after price and impacts how the proceeds are shared in a liquidity event, which is usually defi ned as a sale of the company or the\nmajority of the company’s assets. The liquidation preference is especially important in cases in which a company is sold for less than the\namount of capital invested.\n There are two components that make up what most people call\nthe liquidation preference: the actual preference and participation.\nTo be accurate, the term liquidation preference should pertain only to\nmoney returned to a particular series of the company’s stock ahead of\nother series of stock. Consider, for instance, the following language:\n Liquidation Preference: In the event of any liquidation or winding up of the Company, the holders of the Series A Preferred\nshall be entitled to receive in preference to the holders of the\nCommon Stock a per share amount equal to [X] times the Original Purchase Price plus any declared but unpaid dividends (the\nLiquidation Preference).\n This is the actual preference. In this language, a certain multiple\nof the original investment per share is returned to the investor before\nthe common stock receives any consideration. For many years, a 1×\nliquidation preference, or simply the amount of money invested,\nwas the standard. In 2001, as the Internet bubble burst, investors\noften increased this multiple, sometimes as high as 10× (10 times\nthe entrepreneur’s perspective\n I encourage entrepreneurs not to take valuation personally. Just because VCs\nsay their take is that your business is worth $6 million, when your take is that\nyour business is worth $10 million, doesn’t mean that they lack appreciation for\nyou as a CEO or your business’s future potential. It means they are negotiating\na deal to their advantage, just as you would.\nis coming from a different perspective. Our best advice to entrepreneurs on maximizing price is to focus on what you can control and\nget several different VCs interested in your fi nancing.\nwww.itdf.ir\n46 Venture Deals\nthe amount of money invested). Over time, rational thought prevailed and this number has generally returned to 1×, although you\nwill often see multiple preferences, also known as structure, appear in\nlater-stage or distressed financings.\nThe next thing to consider is whether the investors’ shares are participating. While many people consider the term liquidation preference\nto refer to both the preference and the participation, it’s important to\nseparate the concepts. There are three varieties of participation: full\nparticipation, capped participation, and no participation.\nFully participating stock will receive its liquidation preference\n(typically 1×, but it can be more) and then share in the liquidation\nproceeds on an as-converted basis, where “as-converted” means as if\nthe stock were converted into common stock based on its conversion\nratio. The provision normally looks like this:\nParticipation: After the payment of the Liquidation Preference\nto the holders of the Series A Preferred, the remaining assets\nshall be distributed ratably to the holders of the Common Stock\nand the Series A Preferred on a common equivalent basis.\nCapped participation indicates that the stock will receive its liquidation preference and then share in the liquidation proceeds on\nan as-converted basis until a certain multiple return is reached. If the\nreturn is greater than the cap, then the participation will not apply.\nSample language is as follows:\nParticipation: After the payment of the Liquidation Preference\nto the holders of the Series A Preferred, the remaining assets\nshall be distributed ratably to the holders of the Common Stock\nand the Series A Preferred on a common equivalent basis, provided that the holders of Series A Preferred will stop participating once they have received a total liquidation amount per\nshare equal to [X] times the Original Purchase Price, plus any\ndeclared but unpaid dividends. Thereafter, the remaining assets\nshall be distributed ratably to the holders of the Common Stock.\nOne interesting thing to note in this section is the actual meaning of the multiple of the original purchase price (the [X]). If the\nparticipation multiple is three (three times the original purchase\nprice), it would mean that the preferred would stop participating\nwww.itdf.ir\nconomic erms of the erm Sheet  47\n(on a per share basis) once 300% of its original purchase price was\nreturned, including any amounts paid out on the liquidation preference. This is not an additional 3× return, but rather an additional\n2×, assuming the liquidation preference was a 1× money-back return.\nPerhaps this correlation with the actual preference is the reason the\nterm liquidation preference has come to include both the preference\nand participation terms. If the series is not participating, it will not\nhave a paragraph that looks like the preceding ones.\nNo participation indicates that the stock doesn’t participate after\nreceiving their liquidation preference. In this case, also known as a\n“simple preferred” or “nonparticipating preferred,” the investor has\na choice—they can either get their money back or they can convert\ninto common stock and get proceeds equal to their percentage of\nownership of the company on an as-converted basis.\nWe’ll talk at length about conversion in Chapter 5, but keep in\nmind that the holders of preferred can always convert their preferred stock into common stock if it benefits them. This happens\nwhen a nonparticipating or capped participating preferred holder\nwould make more money by converting to common than if they took\ntheir liquidation preference and participation (if any).\nSince we’ve been talking about liquidation preferences, it’s important to define what a liquidation event is. Often, entrepreneurs think of\na liquidation event as a bad thing, such as a bankruptcy or a winding\ndown of the company. In VC-speak, a liquidation is actually tied to\na liquidity event in which the shareholders receive proceeds for their\nequity in a company and includes mergers, acquisitions, or a change\nof control of the company. As a result, the liquidation preference section determines the allocation of proceeds in both good times and\nbad. Standard language defining a liquidation event looks like this:\nLiquidation Event: A merger, acquisition, sale of voting control\nin which the shareholders of the Company do not own a majority of the outstanding shares of the surviving corporation or sale\nof all or substantially all of the assets of the Company shall be\ndeemed to be a liquidation. Any acquisition agreement that provides for escrowed or other contingent consideration will provide that the allocation of such contingent amounts properly\naccounts for the liquidation preference of the Preferred Stock.\nIronically, lawyers don’t necessarily agree on a standard definition of a liquidation event. Jason once had an entertaining and\nwww.itdf.ir\n48 Venture Deals\nunpleasant debate during a guest lecture he gave at his alma mater\nlaw school (University of Michigan, for those of you wondering) with\na partner from a major Chicago law firm. At the time, this partner\nwas teaching a venture class that semester and claimed that an initial\npublic offering (IPO) should be considered a liquidation event. His\ntheory was that an IPO was the same as a merger, that the company\nwas going away, and thus the investors should get their proceeds.\nEven if such a theory were accepted by an investment banker who\nwould be willing to take the company public (there’s not a chance,\nin our opinion), it makes no sense, as an IPO is simply another funding event for the company, not a liquidation of the company. In fact,\nin almost all IPO scenarios, the VC’s preferred stock is converted to\ncommon stock as part of the IPO, eliminating the issue around a\nliquidity event in the first place.\nLet’s see how this plays out in real life with some examples. To\nkeep it simple, let’s assume that there has been only one round of\nfinancing (a Series A investment) of $5 million at a $10 million premoney valuation. The post-money is $15 million in this case. The\nSeries A investors own 33.3% of the company ($5 million/$15 million), and the entrepreneurs own 66.7% of the company. We are\ngoing to look at four scenarios:\nCase 1: The Series A stock has a 1× liquidation preference and\nno participation;\nCase 2: The Series A stock has a 2× liquidation preference and\nno participation;\nCase 3: The Series A stock has a 1× liquidation preference and is\nfully participating (no cap); and\nCase 4: The Series A stock has a 1× liquidation preference and is\nparticipating up to a 3× cap.\nFor the ease of math, we’ll also round the ownership numbers to\n33% and 67%, respectively, instead of dealing with repeating decimals. In the real world, spreadsheets come in handy here.\nNow, assume that the company has an offer to be acquired for\n$5 million.\nNotice that the preferred holders, so long as they have a 1×\nliquidation preference (regardless of any participation features),\nwww.itdf.ir\nconomic erms of the erm Sheet  49\nhave the right to the entire consideration of the deal given that they\ninvested $5 million and the deal size doesn’t clear the investment\namount. With companies that have raised a lot of money, any acquisition that doesn’t clear the invested capital leaves the common shut\nout of the proceeds. You’ll hear this mentioned as the liquidation\npreference overhang, which is the amount of money that needs to be\nreturned to investors to satisfy all liquidation preferences before the\ncommon holders begin to receive some of the proceeds.\nNow, assume that the company has an offer to be acquired for\n$15 million.\nCase 1: 1× preference, nonparticipating. The Series A can either take\nits $5 million liquidation preference and be done, or convert\nto common and take 33% of the proceeds, which in this case\nis also $5 million. Note that the common gets $10 million\nhere.\nCase 2: 2× preference, nonparticipating. The Series A can either\ntake their 2× preference, which is $10 million, or convert\nto common and take 33%, which is $5 million. In this case,\nthe Series A takes the $10 million, leaving $5 million to the\ncommon, which is half of what they would have made in\nCase 1.\nCase 3: 1× preference, participating. In this case, the Series A investors will get the first $5 million and then 33% of the remaining amount, or $3.3 million (33% of $10 million) for a total\nreturn of $8.3 million. The common will get 67% of the $10\nmillion, or $6.7 million. Notice that in a fully participating\nsecurity, there is never any reason for the preferred to convert.\nThink of this situation as having your cake and eating it also.\nCase 4: 1× preference, participating with a 3× cap. In this case, the\npreferred will not reach the cap ($15 million), so this will be\nthe same as Case 3.\nNow, assume that the company has an offer to be acquired for\n$30 million.\nCase 1: 1× preference, nonparticipating. In this case, the Series A\nconverts and gets 33%, or $10 million, and the common will\nwww.itdf.ir\n50 Venture Deals\nget 67%, or $20 million. If the Series A did not convert, they\nwould only receive $5 million, which is why it converts.\nCase 2: 2× preference, nonparticipating. In this case, the Series A\ninvestors will get 33%, or $10 million, and the common will\nget 67%, or $20 million. Note that both the conversion and\nnonconversion cases lead to the same allocation of proceeds.\nCase 3: 1× preference, participating. In this case, the Series A investors will get the first $5 million and then 33% of the remaining amount, or $8.3 million (33% of $25 million) for a total\nreturn of $13.3 million. The common will get 67% of the $25\nmillion, or $16.7 million.\nCase 4: 1× preference, participating with a 3× cap. In this case, the\npreferred will not reach the cap ($15 million), so this will be\nthe same as Case 3. The preferred will not convert and will\ntake $13.3 million, with the common getting $16.7 million.\nFinally, assume the purchase price is $100 million.\nCase 1: 1× preference, nonparticipating. The Series A investors will\nget 33%, or $33 million, and the common will get 67%, or\n$67 million. The Series A converts, as otherwise it would only\nreceive $5 million.\nCase 2: 2× preference, nonparticipating. The Series A investors will\nget 33%, or $33 million, and the entrepreneurs will get 67%,\nor $67 million. The Series A again converts; otherwise, it\nwould only receive $10 million.\nCase 3: 1× preference, participating. Again, the Series A investors\nget the first $5 million and then 33% of the remaining $95\nmillion, or $31.35 million, for a total of $36.35 million.\nThe common get 67% of the remaining $95 million, or\n$63.65 million.\nCase 4: 1× preference, participating with a 3× cap. In this example,\nthe Series A makes a return better than 3× ($15 million),\nso the participation doesn’t happen and the results are the\nsame as in Cases 1 and 2.\nAs you can see from this example, the participation feature has\na lot of impact at relatively low outcomes and less impact (on a\nwww.itdf.ir\nconomic erms of the erm Sheet  51\npercentage of the deal basis) at higher outcomes. The participation\nfeature will also matter a lot more as more money is raised that has\nthe participation feature (e.g., Series B and C). To understand this,\nlet’s do one last example, this time of a company that has raised\n$50 million where the investors own 60% and the entrepreneurs\nown 40%. Assume the company is being acquired for $100 million.\nCase 1: 1× preference, nonparticipating. The investors can either take\n$50 million or convert. They convert, since doing so results\nin them getting $60 million. The common gets $40 million.\nCase 2: 2× preference, nonparticipating. The investors will get $100\nmillion, or all of the consideration, since it is 2× their invested\ncapital. The common gets nothing. Ouch.\nCase 3: 1× preference, participating. Investors get the first $50 million and then 60% of the remaining $50 million ($30 million) for a total of $80 million. The common gets 40% of the\nremaining $50 million, or $20 million. Again, ouch.\nCase 4: 1× preference, participating with a 3× cap. Since the investors\nwon’t make greater than 3× ($150 million) on this deal, this\nis the same as Case 3.\nLiquidation preferences are usually easy to understand and assess\nwhen dealing with a Series A term sheet. It gets much more complicated to understand what is going on as a company matures and\nsells additional series of equity, since understanding how liquidation\npreferences work between the various series is often mathematically,\nand structurally, challenging. As with many VC-related issues, the\napproach to liquidation preferences among multiple series of stock\nvaries and is often overly complex for no apparent reason.\nThere are two primary approaches:\n1. The follow-on investors will stack their preferences on top of\neach other (known as stacked preferences) where Series B gets\nits preference first, then Series A.\n2. The series are equivalent in status (known as pari passu or\nblended preferences) so that Series A and B share proratably\nuntil the preferences are returned.\nDetermining which approach to use is a black art that is influenced by the relative negotiating power of the investors involved,\nwww.itdf.ir\n52 Venture Deals\nability of the company to go elsewhere for additional financing, economic dynamics of the existing capital structure, and the current\nphase of the moon.\nLet’s look at an example. This time, our example company has\nraised two rounds of financing, a Series A ($5 million invested at\na $10 million pre-money valuation) and a Series B ($20 million\ninvested at a $30 million pre-money valuation). Now, let’s deal with a\nlow outcome, one where the liquidation preference is going to come\ninto play, namely a sale of the company for $15 million.\nIf the preference is stacked, the Series B investors will get the\nentire $15 million. In fact, in this case it won’t matter what the premoney valuation of the Series B was; they’ll get 100% of the consideration regardless.\nHowever, if the preference is blended, the Series A will get 20%\nof every dollar returned (in this case $3 million) and the Series B\nwill get 80% of every dollar returned (or $12 million), based on their\nrelative amounts of the capital invested in the company.\nIn each of these cases the entrepreneurs will receive nothing,\nregardless of whether the preference is participating or nonparticipating, since the preference is $25 million and the company is being\nsold for $15 million, or less than the preference.\nNote that investors get either the liquidation preference and\nparticipation amounts (if any) or what they would get on a fully\nconverted common holding, at their election; they do not get both.\nRealize, however, that in the fully participating case the investors get\ntheir participation amount and then receive what they would get on\na fully converted common holding basis.\nIn early-stage financings, it’s actually in the best interest of both\nthe investor and the entrepreneur to have a simple liquidation preference and no participation. In future rounds, the terms are often\ninherited from the early-stage terms. So if you have a participating\npreferred in a seed round, you could expect to have a participating\npreferred in all subsequent rounds. In this case, if the seed investor doesn’t participate in future rounds, his economics in many outcomes could actually be worse with the participation feature. While\nthe early investor might think he is negotiating a great deal for himself, early investors end up looking like the common holders (in\nterms of returns) since their preference amounts are so small. As a\nresult, we recommend entrepreneurs and our VC co-investors keep\nit simple and lightweight in early rounds.\nwww.itdf.ir\neconomic terms of the term Sheet  53\npay-to-play\n The pay-to-play provision is another important economic term that is\nusually relevant in a down round fi nancing and can be very useful to\nthe entrepreneur in situations where the company is struggling and\nneeds another fi nancing. A typical pay-to-play provision follows:\n Pay-to-Play: In the event of a Qualifi ed Financing (as defi ned\nbelow), shares of Series A Preferred held by any Investor which\nis offered the right to participate but does not participate fully\nthe entrepreneur’s perspective\nLiquidation preference is a critical term that is part of most equity \u001f nancings\nother than small angel \u001f nancings. Participating preferred deals have become\nan unfortunate standard over the years where VCs have essentially decided on\na new standard \u001e oor for deals that require the repayment of principal as well as\na common stock interest in the company on the sale of a company. In the mid1990s, companies used to negotiate so-called kick-outs whereby participation\nrights went away as long as the company had achieved a meaningful return for\nthe VC (2× to 3×). Entrepreneurs should band together to reinstate this as a\nstandard!\n Anything other than a straight participating preferred security, such as multiple preferences, is just greedy on the part of VCs and should be a red \u001e ag to\nyou about the investor.\n Most professional investors will not want to gouge a company\nwith excessive liquidation preferences since the greater the liquidation preference, the lower the potential value of the management\nor employee equity. There’s a fi ne balance here and each case is\nsituation specifi c, but a rational investor will want a combination of\nthe best price while ensuring maximum motivation of management\nand employees. Obviously, what happens in the end is a negotiation and depends on the stage of the company, bargaining strength,\nand existing capital structure; but in general most companies and\ntheir investors will reach a reasonable compromise regarding these\nprovisions. Ultimately, reputable investors will rarely leave the management team with nothing on a liquidation event that is below the\nliquidation preferences despite what the legal documents dictate, a\nsituation called a management carve-out, which we will discuss later.\nwww.itdf.ir\n54 Venture Deals\nin such financing by purchasing at least its pro rata portion as\ncalculated above under “Right of First Refusal” below will be\nconverted into Common Stock.\nA Qualified Financing is the next round of financing after the\nSeries A financing by the Company that is approved by the\nBoard of Directors who determine in good faith that such portion must be purchased pro rata among the stockholders of the\nCompany subject to this provision. Such determination will be\nmade regardless of whether the price is higher or lower than any\nseries of Preferred Stock.\nAt the turn of the millennium, a pay-to-play provision was rarely\nseen. After the Internet bubble burst in 2001, it became ubiquitous.\nInterestingly, this is a term that most companies and their investors\ncan agree on if they approach it from the right perspective.\nIn a pay-to-play provision, investors must keep participating proratably in future financings (paying) in order to not have their preferred stock converted to common stock (playing) in the company.\nThere are various levels of intensity of the pay-to-play provision. The preceding one is pretty aggressive when compared to this\nsofter one:\nIf any holder of Series A Preferred Stock fails to participate\nin the next Qualified Financing (as defined below), on a pro\nrata basis (according to its total equity ownership immediately\nbefore such financing) of their Series A Preferred investment,\nthen such holder will have the Series A Preferred Stock it owns\nconverted into Common Stock of the Company. If such holder\nparticipates in the next Qualified Financing but not to the full\nextent of its pro rata share, then only a percentage of its Series\nA Preferred Stock will be converted into Common Stock (under\nthe same terms as in the preceding sentence), with such percentage being equal to the percent of its pro rata contribution\nthat it failed to contribute.\nWhen determining the number of shares held by an Investor or\nwhether this “Pay-to-Play” provision has been satisfied, all shares\nheld by or purchased in the Qualified Financing by affiliated\ninvestment funds shall be aggregated. An Investor shall be entitled to assign its rights to participate in this financing and future\nwww.itdf.ir\nconomic erms of the erm Sheet  55\nfinancings to its affiliated funds and to investors in the Investor\nand/or its affiliated funds, including funds that are not current\nstockholders of the Company.\nWe believe that pay-to-play provisions are generally good for the\ncompany and its investors. It causes the investors to stand up at the\ntime of their original investment and agree to support the company\nduring its life cycle. If they do not, the stock they have is converted\nfrom preferred to common and they lose the rights associated with\nthe preferred stock. When our co-investors push back on this term,\nwe ask: “Why? Are you not going to fund the company in the future\nif other investors agree to?” Remember, this is not a lifetime guarantee of investment; rather, if other prior investors decide to invest in\nfuture rounds in the company, there will be a strong incentive for\nall of the prior investors to invest or subject themselves to total or\npartial conversion of their holdings to common stock. A pay-to-play\nterm ensures that all the investors agree in advance to the rules of\nengagement concerning future financings.\nThe pay-to-play provision impacts the economics of the deal by\nreducing liquidation preferences for the nonparticipating investors.\nIt also impacts the control of the deal since it reshuffles the future\npreferred shareholder base by ensuring that only the committed\ninvestors continue to have preferred stock and the corresponding\nrights that go along with preferred stock.\nWhen companies are doing well, the pay-to-play provision is\noften waived since a new investor wants to take a large part of the\nnew round. This is a good problem for a company to have, as it typically means there is an up-round financing, existing investors can\nhelp drive company-friendly terms in the new round, and the investor syndicate increases in strength by virtue of new capital (and, presumably, another helpful co-investor) in the deal.\nThe pay-to-play provision may not be appropriate, especially in\nearly rounds if you have investors who generally do not participate\nin follow on rounds as a matter of business practice. For instance, if\na micro VC or seed fund leads your round, they often don’t ever participate in future funding rounds. In these cases, a pay-to-play provision will inappropriately penalize them in the future for supporting\nyou at the beginning when you critically needed their funding. Make\nsure that you understand the future funding dynamics of your VC\npartner and treat them accordingly.\nwww.itdf.ir\n56 Venture Deals\nVesting\n Although vesting is a simple concept, it can have profound and\nunexpected implications. Typically, stock and options will vest over\nfour years. This means that you have to be around for four years to\nown all of your stock or options (from this point forward, we’ll simply refer to the equity that the entrepreneurs and employees receive\nas stock, although exactly the same logic applies to options). If you\nleave the company before the end of the four-year period, the vesting formula applies and you get only a percentage of your stock. As\na result, many entrepreneurs view vesting as a way for VCs to control\nthem, their involvement, and their ownership in a company, which,\nwhile it can be true, is only a part of the story.\n A typical stock-vesting clause looks as follows:\n Stock Vesting: All stock and stock equivalents issued after the\nClosing to employees, directors, consultants, and other service\nproviders will be subject to vesting provisions below unless different vesting is approved by the majority (including at least one\ndirector designated by the Investors) consent of the Board of\nthe entrepreneur’s perspective\n This pay-to-play provision is pretty good for you as an entrepreneur, at least as\nit’s described here. Conversion to common is no big deal in the grand scheme\nof things. What you want to avoid is a pay-to-play scenario where your VC has\nthe right to force a recapitalization of the company (e.g., a \u001f nancing at a $0\npre-money valuation, or something suitably low) if fellow investors don’t play\ninto a new round.\n A provision like this can be particularly bad for less sophisticated angel\ninvestors (e.g., your friends and family) if they don’t have the understanding or\nresources to back up their initial investment with future follow-on investments,\nand can make for uncomfortable conversations around family events.\n There are many circumstances where reasonable investors who like the\ncompany can’t or won’t participate in a \u001f nancing—their venture fund is over,\nor they are strategic or angel investors and don’t have the funds or charter to\ncontinue investing—and you and they shouldn’t be punished excessively for not\nparticipating (remember, a recapitalization hurts you, too, even if you get new\noptions, which always carry vesting, to “top you off”). But conversion to common for lack of follow-on investment is appropriate.\nwww.itdf.ir\nconomic erms of the erm Sheet  57\nDirectors (the “Required Approval”): 25 percent to vest at the\nend of the first year following such issuance, with the remaining 75 percent to vest monthly over the next three years. The\nrepurchase option shall provide that upon termination of the\nemployment of the shareholder, with or without cause, the Company or its assignee (to the extent permissible under applicable\nsecurities law qualification) retains the option to repurchase at\nthe lower of cost or the current fair market value any unvested\nshares held by such shareholder. Any issuance of shares in excess\nof the Employee Pool not approved by the Required Approval\nwill be a dilutive event requiring adjustment of the conversion\nprice as provided above and will be subject to the Investors’ first\noffer rights.\nThe outstanding Common Stock currently held by and\n(the “Founders”) will be subject to similar vesting terms provided that the Founders shall be credited with [one year] of\nvesting as of the Closing, with their remaining unvested shares\nto vest monthly over three years.\nIndustry standard vesting for early-stage companies is a one-year\nvesting cliff and monthly vesting thereafter for a total of four years.\nThis means that if you leave before the first year is up, you haven’t\nvested any of your stock. After a year, you have vested 25% (that’s the\ncliff). Then you begin vesting monthly (or quarterly, or annually)\nover the remaining period. If you have a monthly vest with a oneyear cliff and you leave the company after 18 months, you’ll have\nvested 37.5% (or 18/48) of your stock.\nOften, founders will get somewhat different vesting provisions\nthan the rest of the employees. A common term is the second paragraph of the example clause, where the founders receive one year of\nvesting credit at the closing of the financing and then vest the balance of their stock over the remaining 36 months. This type of vesting arrangement is typical in cases where the founders have started\nthe company a year or more earlier than the VC investment and\nwant to get some credit for existing time served. In cases where the\nfounders started the company within a year of the first VC investment, they will occasionally be able to argue for vesting back to the\ninception of the company.\nUnvested stock typically disappears into the ether when someone leaves the company. The equity doesn’t get reallocated; rather, it\nwww.itdf.ir\n58 Venture Deals\n A key component of vesting is defi ning what, if anything, happens to vesting schedules upon a merger. Single-trigger acceleration\nrefers to automatic accelerated vesting upon a merger. Double-trigger\nacceleration refers to two events needing to take place before accelerated vesting, specifi cally an acquisition of the company combined\nwith the employee in question being fi red by the acquiring company.\n In VC-funded deals, a double trigger is much more common\nthan a single trigger. Acceleration on change of control is often a\ncontentious point of negotiation between founders and VCs, as the\nfounders will want to get all their stock in a transaction—“Hey, we\nearned it!”—and VCs will want to minimize the impact of the outstanding equity on their share of the purchase price. Most acquirers\nwill want there to be some forward-looking incentive for founders,\nmanagement, and employees, so they usually prefer some unvested\nequity to exist to help motivate folks to stick around for a period of\ntime post acquisition. In the absence of this, the acquirer will include\na separate management retention incentive as part of the deal value.\nSince this management retention piece is included in the value of\nthe entrepreneur’s perspective\n How a founder’s stock vests is important. Although simple vesting can work,\nyou should consider alternative strategies such as allowing you to purchase your\nunvested stock at the same price as the \u001f nancing if you leave the company,\nprotecting your position for a termination “without cause,” or treating your vesting as a clawback with an Internal Revenue Code Section 83(b) election so you\ncan lock in long-term capital gains tax rates early on (which is discussed later\nin this book).\ngets reabsorbed and everyone (VCs, stockholders, and option holders) benefi ts ratably from the increase in ownership, also known as\nreverse dilution . In the case of founders’ stock, the unvested stuff just\nvanishes. In the case of unvested employee options, it usually goes\nback into the option pool to be reissued to future employees.\n In some cases, founders own their stock outright through a purchase at the time that the company is established. While the description of what happens to this founders’ stock is often referred to as\nvesting, it’s actually a buy-back right of the company. Though there\nare technically the same outcomes, the legal language around this is\nsomewhat different and matters for tax purposes.\nwww.itdf.ir\nconomic erms of the erm Sheet  59\nthe transaction, it effectively reduces the consideration that gets\nallocated to the equity owners of the company, including the VCs\nand any founders who are no longer actively involved in the company. This often frustrates VCs since it puts them at cross-purposes\nwith management in an acquisition negotiation—everyone should\nbe negotiating to maximize the value for all shareholders, not just\nspecifically for themselves. Although the actual legal language is not\nvery interesting, it is included here:\nIn the event of a merger, consolidation, sale of assets, or other\nchange of control of the Company and should an Employee\nbe terminated without cause within one year after such event,\nsuch person shall be entitled to [one year] of additional vesting.\nOther than the foregoing, there shall be no accelerated vesting\nin any event.\nStructuring acceleration on change-of-control terms used to be\na huge deal in the 1990s when pooling of interests was an accepted\nform of accounting treatment, since there were significant constraints on any modifications to vesting agreements. Pooling was\nabolished in early 2000, and under current acquisition accounting\ntreatment (also known as purchase accounting) there is no meaningful accounting impact in a merger of changing the vesting arrangements (including accelerating vesting). As a result, we usually recommend a balanced approach to acceleration such as a double trigger\nwith one-year acceleration and recognize that this will often be negotiated during an acquisition. It’s important to recognize that many\nVCs have a distinct point of view on this; some VCs will never do a\ndeal with single-trigger acceleration, whereas some VCs don’t really\ncare very much. As in any negotiation, make sure you are not negotiating against a point of principle, as VCs will often say, “That’s how\nit is and we won’t do anything different.”\nRecognize that vesting works for the founders as well as the VCs.\nWe have been involved in a number of situations where one founder\ndidn’t stay with the company very long either by choice or because\nthe other founders wanted her to leave the company. In these situations, if there hadn’t been vesting provisions, the person who didn’t\nstay at the company would have walked away with all of her stock and\nthe remaining founders would have had no differential ownership\ngoing forward. By vesting each founder, there is a clear incentive to\nwww.itdf.ir\n60 Venture Deals\nexercise period\n One provision that is not generally found in term sheets but that is\nclosely aligned with vesting is the concept of an exercise period . Once\nstock is vested, a holder may exercise the option by paying the purchase price to the company. In other words, if you have an option for\n1,000 shares of stock at $0.10 a share, you can pay $100 to the company (after all the shares have vested) and own the stock outright.\nOften, current employees of a company don’t do this, as they want\nto see how successful the company will be before they use funds to\nthe entrepreneur’s perspective\n While single-trigger acceleration might seem appealing, double-trigger acceleration with some boundaries makes a lot of sense. Any entrepreneur who has\nbeen on the buy side of an acquisition will tell you that having one or two years’\nworth of guaranteed transition on the part of an acquired management team is\ncritical to an acquisition’s \u001f nancial success.\nwork your hardest and participate constructively in the team, beyond\nthe elusive founder’s moral imperative. The same rule applies to\nemployees; since equity is another form of compensation, vesting is\nthe mechanism to ensure the equity is earned over time.\n Time to exit has a huge impact on the relevancy of vesting. In the\nlate 1990s, when companies often reached an exit event within two\nyears of being founded, the vesting provisions, especially acceleration clauses, mattered a huge amount to the founders. In a market\nwhere the typical gestation period of an early-stage company is fi ve\nto seven years, most people, especially founders and early employees\nwho stay with a company, will be fully (or mostly) vested at the time\nof an exit event.\n While it’s easy to set vesting up as a contentious issue between\nfounders and VCs, we recommend the founding entrepreneurs view\nvesting as an overall alignment tool—for themselves, their cofounders, early employees, and future employees. Anyone who has experienced an unfair vesting situation will have strong feelings about\nit; a balanced approach and consistency are key to making vesting\nprovisions work long-term in a company.\nwww.itdf.ir\nconomic erms of the erm Sheet  61\npurchase stock, although if the cost of exercising is low enough\nthere’s a significant tax advantage by exercising the options, as you’ll\nnow own stock that will be subject to capital gains tax treatment,\ninstead of options which are subject to ordinary income tax treatment.\nHowever, once a person leaves a company, the exercise period\ndetermines how long the departed employee has to purchase their\nstock. Historically, this time period has been 90 days. If you leave the\ncompany for any reason (voluntarily or not), then you have up to\n90 days to pay the $100 to the company for the stock; otherwise, the\nstock would be forfeited and returned to the stock option plan to be\ngranted to other employees.\nThere have been recent efforts to change this, as some feel\nit’s not fair for recently departed employees to have to pay for\ntheir options within 90 days or forfeit the stock they earned during their employment. There are some companies which have\nchanged their exercise periods to the maximum legal amount,\nwhich is 10 years from the date of grant.\nAs a current topic, it will be interesting to see how this all works\nout. What concerns us about the extension of the exercise period is\nthat it allows people to change jobs frequently and acquire options\nin a number of companies, undermining the retention benefits\nof options. Furthermore, the ultimate balance of equity between\nearly employees who leave within a year or two, but hold on to their\noptions for a decade can get out of alignment with later employees,\nwho stay longer, but start with less options.\nAt this point, we tend to prefer to deal with this issue on a caseby-case basis. If the employee leaving merits this type of treatment,\nthe company can always choose to extend the exercise period as part\nof the termination agreement.\nmployee ool\nAnother economic term that matters, but is often not focused on\nuntil the end of the negotiation, is the employee pool (also known as\nthe option pool). The employee pool is the amount of the company\nthat is reserved for future issuance to employees. Typical language\nfollows:\nEmployee Pool: Prior to the Closing, the Company will reserve\nshares of its Common Stock so that percent of its fully diluted\nwww.itdf.ir\n62 Venture Deals\ncapital stock following the issuance of its Series A Preferred is\navailable for future issuances to directors, officers, employees,\nand consultants. The term “Employee Pool” shall include both\nshares reserved for issuance as stated above, as well as current\noptions outstanding, which aggregate amount is approximately\n% of the Company’s fully diluted capital stock following the\nissuance of its Series A Preferred.\nThe employee pool is called out in a separate section in order to\nclarify the capital structure and specifically define the percentage of\nthe company that will be allocated to the option pool associated with\nthe financing. Since a capitalization table is almost always included\nwith the term sheet, this section is redundant, but exists so there is\nno confusion about the size of the option pool.\nIt is important to understand the impact of the size of the pool\non the valuation of the financing. As with pre-money and post-money\nvaluations, VCs often sneak in additional economics for themselves\nby increasing the amount of the option pool on a pre-money basis.\nLet’s go through an example. Assume that a $2 million financing\nis being done at a $10 million post-money valuation. In this case, the\nnew investors get 20% of the company for $2 million and the effective post-money valuation is $10 million. Before the financing there\nis a 10% unallocated option pool. However, in the term sheet, the\ninvestors put a provision that the post financing unallocated option\npool will be 20%. This results in a post financing ownership split of\n20% to the new investors, 60% to the old shareholders, and an unallocated employee pool of 20%.\nIn contrast, if the 10% option pool that previously existed was\nsimply rolled over, the post-money allocation would still be 20% to\nnew investors, but the old shareholders would get 70% and the unallocated option pool would be 10%.\nWhile in both cases the investors end up with 20%, the old shareholders have 10% less ownership in the case of the 20% option pool.\nAlthough the additional ownership will ultimately end up in the\nhands of future employees, it is effectively coming out of the old\nshareholders rather than being shared between the new investors\nand the old shareholders. This will result in a lower price per share\nfor the new investors and effectively a lower pre-money valuation.\nIf the VC is pushing for a larger option pool to come out of the\npre-money valuation but the entrepreneur feels that there is enough\nwww.itdf.ir\nconomic erms of the erm Sheet  63\nin the pool to meet the company’s needs over the time frame of\nthis financing, the entrepreneur can say, “Look, I strongly believe we\nhave enough options to cover our needs. Let’s go with it at my proposed level and if we should need to expand the option pool before\nthe next financing, we will provide full anti-dilution protection for\nyou to cover that.”\nntidilution\nThe final key economic provision is antidilution. A typical antidilution clause in a term sheet follows:\nAntidilution Provisions: The conversion price of the Series A\nPreferred will be subject to a [full ratchet/broad-based/narrow\nbased weighted average] adjustment to reduce dilution in the\nevent that the Company issues additional equity securities—\nother than shares (i) reserved as employee shares described\nunder the Company’s option pool; (ii) shares issued for consideration other than cash pursuant to a merger, consolidation,\nacquisition, or similar business combination approved by the\nBoard; (iii) shares issued pursuant to any equipment loan or\nleasing arrangement, real property leasing arrangement, or debt\nfinancing from a bank or similar financial institution approved\nby the Board; and (iv) shares with respect to which the holders\nof a majority of the outstanding Series A Preferred waive their\nantidilution rights—at a purchase price less than the applicable\nconversion price. In the event of an issuance of stock involving\ntranches or other multiple closings, the antidilution adjustment\nshall be calculated as if all stock was issued at the first closing.\nThe conversion price will also be subject to proportional adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends, combinations, recapitalizations, and the like.\nYeah, we agree—that’s a mouthful. It’s also a clause that often\ntrips up entrepreneurs. While the antidilution provision is used to\nprotect investors in the event a company issues equity at a lower valuation than in previous financing rounds, it is also an excuse for lawyers to use a spreadsheet. There are two varieties: weighted average\nantidilution and ratchet-based antidilution.\nFull ratchet antidilution means that if the company issues shares\nat a price lower than the price for the series with the full ratchet\nwww.itdf.ir\n64 Venture Deals\nprovision, then the earlier round price is effectively reduced to\nthe price of the new issuance. One can get creative and do partial\nratchets, such as half ratchets or two-thirds ratchets, which are less\nharsh but rarely seen.\nFull ratchets came into vogue in the 2001–2003 time frame when\ndown rounds were all the rage, but the most common antidilution\nprovision is based on the weighted average concept, which takes\ninto account the magnitude of the lower-priced issuance, not just\nthe actual valuation. In a full ratchet world, if the company sold one\nshare of its stock to someone for a price lower than the previous\nround, all of the previous round stock would be repriced to the new\nissuance price. In a weighted average world, the number of shares\nissued at the reduced price is considered in the repricing of the previous round. Mathematically (and this is where the lawyers get to\nshow off their math skills—although you’ll notice there are no exponents or summation signs anywhere) it works as follows:\nNCP = OCP * CSO + CSP\nCSO + CSAP\nwhere:\nNCP = new conversion price\nOCP = old conversion price\nCSO = common stock outstanding\nCSP = common stock purchasable with consideration\nreceived by company (i.e., what the buyer should\nhave bought if it hadn’t been a down round issuance)\nCSAP = common stock actually purchased in subsequent\nissuance (i.e., what the buyer actually bought)\nNote that despite the fact one is buying preferred stock, the calculations are always done on an as-if-converted (to common stock)\nbasis. The company is not issuing more shares; rather, it determines\na new conversion price for the previous series of stock. Alternatively, the company can issue more shares, but we think this is a silly\nand unnecessarily complicated approach that merely increases the\namount the lawyers can bill the company for the financing. Consequently, antidilution provisions usually generate a conversion price\nadjustment.\nwww.itdf.ir\nconomic erms of the erm Sheet  65\nYou might note the term broad-based in describing weighted average anti-dilution. What makes the provision broad-based versus narrow-based is the definition of common stock outstanding (CSO). A\nbroad-based weighted average provision encompasses both the company’s common stock outstanding (including all common stock issuable upon conversion of its preferred stock) as well as the number\nof shares of common stock that could be obtained by converting all\nother options, rights, and securities (including employee options).\nA narrow-based provision will not include these other convertible\nsecurities and will limit the calculation to only currently outstanding\nsecurities. The number of shares and how you count them matter;\nmake sure you are agreeing on the same definition, as you’ll often\nfind different lawyers arguing over what to include or not include in\nthe definitions.\nIn our example language, we’ve included a section that is generally referred to as “antidilution carve-outs”—the section “other than\nshares (i) . . . (iv).” These are the standard exceptions for shares\ngranted at lower prices for which anti-dilution does not apply. From\na company and entrepreneur perspective, more exceptions are better, and most investors will accept these carve-outs without much\nargument.\nOne particular item to note is the last carve-out:\n(iv) shares with respect to which the holders of a majority of the\noutstanding Series A Preferred waive their antidilution rights.\nThis is a carve-out that started appearing recently, which we have\nfound to be very helpful in deals where a majority of the Series A\ninvestors agree to further fund a company in a follow-on financing,\nbut the price will be lower than the original Series A. In this example, several minority investors signaled they were not planning to\ninvest in the new round, as they would have preferred to sit back\nand increase their ownership stake via the anti-dilution provision.\nHaving the larger investors (the majority of the class) step up and\nvote to carve the financing out of the antidilution terms was a bonus\nfor the company common stockholders and employees, who would\nhave suffered the dilution of additional anti-dilution from investors\nwho were not continuing to participate in financing the company.\nThis approach encourages the minority investors to participate in\nthe round in order to protect themselves from dilution.\nwww.itdf.ir\n66 Venture Deals\nOccasionally, antidilution will be absent in a Series A term sheet.\nInvestors love precedent (e.g., the new investor says, “I want what\nthe last guy got, plus more”). In many cases, antidilution provisions\nhurt Series A investors more than later investors if you assume the\nSeries A price is the low-water mark for the company. For instance,\nif the Series A price is $1, the Series B price is $5, and the Series C\nprice is $3, then the Series B benefits from the antidilution provision\nat the expense of the Series A. Our experience is that antidilution\nis usually requested despite this, as Series B investors will most likely\nalways ask for it and, since they do, the Series A investors proactively\nask for it anyway.\nIn addition to economic impacts, antidilution provisions can\nhave control impacts. First, the existence of an antidilution provision\nwill motivate the company to issue new rounds of stock at higher\nvaluations because of the impact of antidilution protection on the\ncommon stockholders. In some cases, a company may pass on taking\nan additional investment at a lower valuation, although practically\nspeaking, this happens only when a company has other alternatives\nto the financing. A recent phenomenon is to tie antidilution calculations to milestones the investors have set for the company, resulting in a conversion price adjustment in the case that the company\ndoes not meet certain revenue, product development, or other business milestones. In this situation, the antidilution adjustment occurs\nautomatically if the company does not meet its objectives, unless the\ninvestor waives it after the fact. This creates a powerful incentive for\nthe company to accomplish its investor-determined goals. We tend to\navoid this approach, as blindly hitting predetermined product and\nsales milestones set at the time of a financing is not always best for\nthe long-term development of a company, especially if these goals\nend up creating a diverging set of objectives between management\nand the investors as the business evolves.\nAntidilution provisions are almost always part of a financing, so\nunderstanding the nuances and knowing which aspects to negotiate\nare an important part of the entrepreneur’s tool kit. We advise you\nnot to get hung up in trying to eliminate antidilution provisions.\nInstead, focus on minimizing their impact and building value in\nyour company after the financing so they don’t ever come into play.\nwww.itdf.ir\n67\n 5 C H A P T E R\nControl Terms of the Term Sheet\nThe terms we discussed in the preceding chapter defi ne the economics of a deal; the next batch of terms defi ne the control parameters of a deal. Venture capitalists (VCs) care about control provisions\nin order to keep an eye on their investments as well as comply with\ncertain federal tax statutes that are a result of the types of investors\nthat invest in VC funds. Some control provisions are necessary to\nprevent VCs from running afoul of the fi duciary duties they owe to\nboth their investors and the companies they invest in. While VCs\noften have less than 50% ownership of a company, they usually have\na variety of control terms that effectively give them control of many\nactivities of the company.\n In this chapter we discuss the following terms: board of directors,\nprotective provisions, drag-along rights, and conversion.\n Board of Directors\n One of the key control mechanisms is the process for electing the\nboard of directors. The entrepreneur should think carefully about\nwhat the proper balance should be among investor, company,\nfounder, and outside representation on the board.\nThe Entrepreneur’s Perspective\n Electing a board of directors is an important, and delicate, point. Your board is\nyour inner sanctum, your strategic planning department, and your judge, jury,\nand executioner all at once. Some VCs are terrible board members, even if\nthey’re good investors and nice people.\nVenture Deals: Be Smarter than Your Lawyer\nand Venture Capitalist, Third Edition\nBy Brad Feld and Jason Mendelson\nCopyright © 2016 by Brad Feld and Jason Mendelson\nwww.itdf.ir\n68 Venture Deals\n A typical board of directors clause follows:\n Board of Directors: The size of the Company’s Board of Directors shall be set at [X]. The Board shall initially be comprised\nof __________, as the Investor representative[s] _________,\n_________, and __________. At each meeting for the election\nof directors, the holders of the Series A Preferred, voting as a\nseparate class, shall be entitled to elect [X] member[s] of the\nCompany’s Board of Directors which director shall be designated\nby Investor, the holders of Common Stock, voting as a separate\nclass, shall be entitled to elect [X] member[s], and the remaining\ndirectors will be [Option 1: mutually agreed upon by the Common and Preferred, voting together as a single class] [or Option\n2: chosen by the mutual consent of the Board of Directors].\n If a subset of the board is being chosen by more than one constituency (e.g., two directors chosen by the investors, two by founders\nor common stockholders, and one by mutual consent), you should\nconsider what is best: chosen by mutual consent of the board (one\nperson, one vote) or voted upon on the basis of proportional share\nownership on a common-as-converted basis.\n VCs will often want to include a board observer as part of the\nagreement either instead of or in addition to an offi cial member of\nthe board. The value of this will depend on who the observer is. With\nmany VC fi rms, the observer will be an associate in the fi rm. In these\ncases, some will be just there to learn (and in the worst cases talk about\nboard topics to their friends over beers in order to look cool and\nimportant), while others are immensely helpful. You’ll even run into\nobservers who are more helpful than the VC partner on your board.\nThe Entrepreneur’s Perspective\n Be wary of observers. Sometimes they add no value yet they do take up seats at\nthe table. Often, it’s not about who votes at a board meeting, but the discussion\nthat occurs, so observers can sway the balance of a board. You don’t want to\n\u001f nd yourself with a pre-revenue company and 15 people around the table at a\nboard meeting.\n Many investors will mandate that one of the board members\nchosen by common stockholders be the then-serving CEO of the\nwww.itdf.ir\nControl Terms of the Term Sheet 69\ncompany. This can be tricky if the CEO is the same as one of the\nkey founders (often you’ll see language giving the right to a board\nseat to one of the founders and a separate board seat to the then\nCEO), consuming two of the common board seats. Then, if the CEO\nchanges, so does that board seat.\nLet’s go through two examples: an early-stage board for a\ncompany that has raised its first round of capital and the board\nof a company that is mature and contemplating an initial public\noffering (IPO).\nIn the case of the early-stage board, there will often be three to\nfive board members:\nThe three-person board will typically consist of:\n1. Founder/CEO\n2. VC\n3. An outside board member, or perhaps another founder\nThe five-person board will typically consist of:\n1. Founder\n2. CEO\n3. VC\n4. A second VC\n5. An outside board member\nThese are the default cases for a balanced board that gives the\nVC enough influence to be comfortable without having control over\nthe board. Correspondingly, the founder(s) and CEO will have the\nsame number of seats as the VCs, and the outside board member will\nbe able to help resolve any conflicts that arise as well as be a legitimately independent board member.\nIn the case of a mature board, you’ll typically see more board\nmembers (seven to nine) with more outside board members. The\nCEO and one of the founders are on this board along with a few of\nthe VCs (depending on the amount of money raised). However, the\nmajority of the additions to the board are outside board members,\ntypically experienced entrepreneurs or executives in the domain in\nwhich the company is operating.\nWhile it is appropriate for board members and observers to be\nreimbursed for their reasonable out-of-pocket costs for attending\nwww.itdf.ir\n70 Venture Deals\nboard meetings, we rarely see board members receive cash compensation for serving on the board of a private company. Outside\nboard members are usually compensated with stock options—just\nlike key employees—and are often invited to invest money in the\ncompany alongside the VCs. Usually you see these outsiders receive\noptions to purchase 0.25% to 0.5% of the company that vest over\ntwo to four years.\nWe are of the opinion that VCs don’t want to control boards of\nportfolio companies. If the board votes are really that contentious\nthen the company is in serious trouble. Instead of controlling the\nboard, VCs generally use protective provisions, which we will discuss in\nthe next section, to provide the control they want over the company.\nWe are also of the opinion that the founders are better off not\ncontrolling the board, either. Having an outside board member can\nbe invaluable for certain corporate governance issues that one will\nwant an impartial vote for. Also, having a true outside board member\nwill bring diversity of thought that most insiders (including both the\ncommon and preferred holders) won’t bring to the board room.\nIf you are interested in learning a lot more about how boards of\ndirectors work, and more importantly how to make them useful, get\na copy of one of Brad’s other books (edited by Jason), titled Startup\nBoards: Getting the Most Out of Your Board of Directors.\nProtective Provisions\nThe next key control term you will encounter in the term sheet is\nprotective provisions. Protective provisions are effectively veto rights\nthat investors have on certain actions by the company. Not surprisingly, these provisions protect VCs, although unfortunately not from\nthemselves.\nOnce upon a time, the protective provisions were often hotly\nnegotiated but over time have mostly become standardized. Entrepreneurs would like to see few or no protective provisions in their\ndocuments. In contrast, VCs would like to have some veto-level control over a set of actions the company could take, especially when it\nimpacts the VCs’ economic position.\nA typical protective provision clause looks as follows:\nFor so long as any shares of Series A Preferred remain outstanding, consent of the Required Percentage of the Series A Preferred\nshall be required for any action, whether directly or though\nwww.itdf.ir\nControl Terms of the Term Sheet 71\nany merger, recapitalization or similar event, that (i) alters or\nchanges the rights, preferences or privileges of the Series A\nPreferred, (ii) increases or decreases the authorized number of\nshares of Common or Preferred Stock, (iii) creates (by reclassification or otherwise) any new class or series of shares having\nrights, preferences or privileges senior to or on a parity with the\nSeries A Preferred, (iv) results in the redemption or repurchase\nof any shares of Common Stock (other than pursuant to equity\nincentive agreements with service providers giving the Company\nthe right to repurchase shares upon the termination of services),\n(v) results in any merger, other corporate reorganization, sale of\ncontrol, or any transaction in which all or substantially all of the\nassets of the Company are sold, (vi) amends or waives any provision of the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws,\n(vii) increases or decreases the authorized size of the Company’s\nBoard of Directors, (viii) results in the payment or declaration\nof any dividend on any shares of Common Preferred Stock,\n(ix) issues debt in excess of $100,000, (x) makes any voluntary\npetition for bankruptcy or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or (xi) enters into any exclusive license, lease, sale, distribution or other disposition of its products or intellectual property.\nLet’s translate this into what the VC is trying to protect against.\nSimply, unless the VC agrees, the company can’t:\n● Change the terms of stock owned by the VC;\n● Authorize the creation of more stock;\n● Issue stock senior or equal to the VCs;\n● Buy back any common stock;\n● Sell the company;\n● Change the certificate of incorporation or bylaws;\n● Change the size of board of directors.\n● Pay or declare a dividend;\n● Borrow money;\n● Declare bankruptcy without the VCs approval; or\n● License away the IP of the company, effectively selling the\ncompany without the VCs consent.\nSubsection (ix) of the protective provision clause is often the first\nthing that gets changed by raising the debt threshold to something\nwww.itdf.ir\n72 Venture Deals\nhigher, as long as the company is a real operating business rather\nthan an early-stage startup. Another easily accepted change is to add\na minimum threshold of preferred shares outstanding for the protective provisions to apply, keeping the protective provisions from\nlingering on forever when the capital structure is changed—through\neither a positive or a negative event.\n Many company counsels will ask for materiality qualifi ers —for\ninstance, that the word material or materially be inserted in front of\nsubsections (i), (ii), and (vi) in the example. We always decline this\nrequest, not to be stubborn, but because we don’t really know what\nmaterial means (if you ask a judge or read any case law, that will not\nhelp you, either), and we believe that specifi city is more important\nthan debating reasonableness. Remember that these are protective\nprovisions; they don’t eliminate the ability to do these things, but\nsimply require consent of the investors. As long as things are not\nmaterial from the VC’s point of view, the consent to do these things\nwill be granted. We’d always rather be clear up front what the rules\nof engagement are rather than have a debate over what the word\nmaterial means in the middle of a situation where these protective\nprovisions might come into play. Finally, there have been several\nlegal cases in the last decade that have all gone against VCs for not\ndrafting language that is specifi c.\nThe Entrepreneur’s Perspective\n As far as the example protective provision clause is concerned, (i) fair is fair;\n(ii) fair is fair; (iii) fair is fair; (iv) this should be positive for VCs, but not a\nbig deal; (v) this is critical as long as Series A preferred holders represent, in\naggregate, enough of your capitalization table to be relevant; (vi) makes sense;\n(vii) this is critical as long as Series A preferred holders represent, in aggregate,\nenough of your cap table to be relevant; (viii) you will never have to worry about\nthis; (ix) this is \u001f ne, though you should try to get a higher limit or an exclusion\nfor equipment \u001f nancing in the normal course of business; (x) and (xi) are \u001f ne.\n When future fi nancing rounds occur (e.g., Series B, a new class\nof preferred stock), there is always a discussion as to how the protective provisions will work with regard to the new class. There are two\ncases: the Series B gets its own protective provisions or the Series B\ninvestors vote alongside the original investors as a single class. Entrepreneurs almost always will want a single vote for all the investors, as\nwww.itdf.ir\nControl Terms of the Term Sheet 73\nthe separate investor class protective provision vote means the company now has two classes of potential veto constituents to deal with.\nNormally, new investors will ask for a separate vote, as their interests\nmay diverge from those of the original investors due to different\npricing, different risk profi les, and a false need for overall control.\nHowever, many experienced investors will align with the entrepreneur’s point of view of not wanting separate class votes, as they do\nnot want the potential headaches of another equity class vetoing\nan important company action. If Series B investors are the same as\nSeries A investors, this is an irrelevant discussion and it should be\neasy for everyone to default to voting as a single class. If you have\nnew investors in the Series B, be wary of inappropriate veto rights\nfor small investors; for example, the consent percentage required\nis 90% instead of a majority (50.1%), enabling a new investor who\nowns only 10.1 percent of the fi nancing to effectively assert control\nover the protective provisions through his vote.\nThe Entrepreneur’s Perspective\n Regardless of who your investors are, \u001f ght to have them vote as a single class.\nIt’s critical for your sanity. It keeps investors aligned. And as long as your capitalization table is rational, it won’t matter.\n Some investors feel they have enough control with their board\ninvolvement to ensure that the company does not take any action\ncontrary to their interests, and as a result will not focus on these\nprotective provisions. During a fi nancing this is the typical argument used by company counsel to try to convince the VCs to back\noff of some or all of the protective provisions. We think this is a\nshortsighted approach for the investor, since, as a board member, an\ninvestor designee has legal duties (tirelessly referred to in moments\nof confl ict as a fi duciary duty ) to work in the best interests of the company. At the same time, VCs also have a fi duciary duty to their investors as well. Sometimes the interests of the company and a particular\nclass of shareholders diverge. Therefore, there can be times when\nan individual would legally have to approve something as a board\nmember in the best interests of the company as a whole and not\nhave a protective provision to fall back on as a shareholder. While\nthis dynamic does not necessarily benefi t the entrepreneur, it’s good\nwww.itdf.ir\n74 Venture Deals\ngovernance as it functionally separates the duties of a board member\nfrom those of a shareholder, shining a brighter light on an area of\npotential confl ict.\n While one could make the argument that protective provisions\nare at the core of the trust between a VC and an entrepreneur, we\nthink that’s a hollow and naive statement. When an entrepreneur\nasks, “Don’t you trust me? Why do we need these things?” the simple\nanswer is that it is not an issue of trust. Rather, we like to eliminate the\ndiscussion about who ultimately gets to make which decisions before\nwe do a deal. Eliminating the ambiguity in roles, control, and rules\nof engagement is an important part of any fi nancing, and the protective provisions cut to the heart of this. As discussed in Chap ter 15 ,\nall of this legal activity is an attempt to clarify the rules of engagement\nand align incentives between investors and entrepreneurs.\n Occasionally the protective provisions can help the entrepreneur, especially in an acquisition scenario. Since the investor can\neffectively block a sale of the company, this provides the entrepreneur with some additional leverage when negotiating with the buyer\nsince the price needs to be high enough to garner the VC’s consent\non the deal. Of course, this assumes a reasonable position from the\nexisting investor, but in most cases an experienced VC will support\nthe entrepreneur’s decision to sell a company.\n A decade ago the protective provisions took several days to negotiate. Over time these provisions have been hotly tested in courts\nof law from several important judicial decisions, so today they have\nbecome mostly boilerplate with the only extended negotiation often\nbeing around the word materiality.\nThe Entrepreneur’s Perspective\n Remember, you are negotiating this deal on behalf of the company (no matter\nwho runs it in the future) and with the investors (no matter who owns the shares\nin the future). These terms are not only about your current relationship with the\nVC in question.\nDrag-Along Agreement\n Another important control provision is the drag-along agreement .\nUnder certain circumstances, the company will not want a specifi c\nshareholder to vote his shares in whatever way the shareholder wants,\nwww.itdf.ir\nControl Terms of the Term Sheet 75\nbut instead prefers to have the shares voted by a certain investor or\nclass of investors. Unless a shareholder is on the board, she generally doesn’t have a legal duty to keep the company’s best interests\nin mind.\nThere are two general flavors of drag-along agreements. The\nfirst is where the preferred investors drag-along the common shareholders. This agreement gives the preferred investors the ability to\nforce, or drag along, all of the other investors and the founders to\ndo a sale of the company, regardless of how the folks being dragged\nalong feel about the deal.\nTypical language follows:\nDrag-Along Agreement: The [holders of the Common Stock] or\n[Founders] and Series A Preferred shall enter into a drag-along\nagreement whereby if a majority of the holders of Series A Preferred agree to a sale or liquidation of the Company, the holders\nof the remaining Series A Preferred and Common Stock shall\nconsent to and raise no objections to such sale.\nAfter the Internet bubble burst of the early 2000s and sales\nof companies started occurring that were at or below the liquidation preferences, entrepreneurs and founders—not surprisingly—\nstarted to resist selling the company in these situations since they\noften weren’t getting anything in the deal. While there are several\nmechanisms to address sharing consideration below the liquidation\npreferences, such as the notion of a carve-out, which we’ll discuss\nlater, the fundamental issue is that if a transaction occurs below the\nliquidation preferences, it’s likely that some or all of the VCs are losing money on the transaction. The VC point of view on this varies\nwidely and is often dependent on the situation; some VCs can deal\nwith this and are happy to provide some consideration to management to get a deal done, whereas others are stubborn in their view\nthat since they lost money, management and founders shouldn’t\nreceive anything.\nIn each of these situations, the VCs would much rather control\ntheir ability to compel other shareholders to support the transaction. As more of these situations appeared, the major holders of\ncommon stock (even when they were in the minority of ownership)\nbegan refusing to vote for the proposed transaction unless the holders of preferred stock waived part of their liquidation preferences in\nwww.itdf.ir\n76 Venture Deals\nfavor of the common stock. Needless to say, this particular holdout\ntechnique did not go over well in the venture community and, as a\nresult, the drag-along agreement became more prevalent.\nMore recently, a second flavor of drag-along has come to exist\nand it is one that we prefer. In this version, if a founder leaves the\ncompany, their stock will be dragged along by all other classes of\nstock. In other words, a departed founder (who may or may not harbor ill will toward the company) cannot play the hold out on voting\nmatters. Typical language looks like this:\nDrag-Along Agreement: When a Founder leaves the Company,\nsuch Founder shall agree to vote his Common Stock or Series A\nPreferred (or Common Stock acquired on conversion of Series\nA or Former Series A Preferred) in the same proportion as all\nother shares are voted in any vote.\nNote that the dragged along shares are voted in proportion to\nall the other votes cast. So if the vote is 90% yes and 10% no, the\ndeparted founder’s shares will be voted in a 90/10 split.\nIf you are faced with a drag-along situation, your ownership position will determine whether or not this is an important issue for you.\nAn acquisition does not require unanimous consent of shareholders;\nthese rules vary by jurisdiction, although the two most common situations are either majority of each class (California) or majority of all\nshares on an as-converted basis (Delaware). However, most acquirers\nwill want 85% to 90% of shareholders to consent to a transaction. If\nyou own one percent of a company and the VCs would like you to\nsign up to a drag-along agreement, it doesn’t matter much unless\nthere are 30 of you who each own one percent. Make sure you know\nwhat you are fighting for in the negotiation, and don’t put disproportionate energy against terms that don’t matter.\nWhen a company is faced with the first flavor of a drag-along\nagreement in a VC financing proposal, the most common compromise position is to try to get the drag-along rights to pertain to following the majority of the common stock, not the preferred. This way, if\nyou own common stock, you are dragged along only when a majority\nof the common stockholders consent to the transaction. This is a\ngraceful position for a very small investor to take (e.g., “I’ll play ball\nif a majority of the common plays ball”) and one that we’ve always\nbeen willing to take when we’ve owned common stock in a company\n(e.g., “I’m not going to stand in the way of something a majority of\nwww.itdf.ir\nControl Terms of the Term Sheet 77\nfolks who have rights equal to me want to do”). Of course, preferred\ninvestors can always convert some of their holdings to common stock\nto generate a majority, but this also results in a benefi t to the common stockholders as it lowers the overall liquidation preference.\n During the term sheet negotiation, pay attention to what your\nlawyer might be saying to your investor during the negotiation of\na drag-along. We’ve seen many lawyers slam their fi sts on the table\nrejecting any notion of a drag-along. While we clearly understand\nthe argument why a drag-along might not be in the best interests of\nan individual, it’s hard for us to see how this is not in the best interests of the company. In that instance we being to wonder whether\nthe lawyer is representing the company—who they should be representing—or the founder(s). While nuanced, the dynamic can be\nprofoundly important, especially when there is confl ict between a\nfounder and the company.\nThe Entrepreneur’s Perspective\n This is one of those terms that matter most if things are falling apart, in which\ncase you probably have bigger \u001f sh to fry. And it cuts both ways—if you have a lot\nof investors, for example, this term can force them all to agree to a deal, which\nmight save you from a lot of agitation down the road. Of course, it is best to not\nbe in a \u001f re sale situation, or at least to have enough board members whom you\ncontrol (at least effectively, if not contractually) so that you can prevent a bad\ndeal from happening in the \u001f rst place.\nThe Entrepreneur’s Perspective\n Amen. “This is nonnegotiable” is usually a phrase thrown out by junior members of VC \u001f rms when they don’t know any better. In particular, watch out for\nthe “This is how we always do deals” or “This is a standard deal term for us”\nnegotiating tactic as being ultra-lame and a sign that the people you’re negotiating with don’t really know what they are doing.\nConversion\n While many VCs posture during term sheet negotiations by saying\nthings like “That is nonnegotiable,” terms rarely are. Occasionally,\nthough, a term will actually be nonnegotiable, and conversion is one\nsuch term.\nwww.itdf.ir\n78 Venture Deals\nIn all the VC deals we’ve ever seen, the preferred shareholders\nhave the right—at any time—to convert their stake into common\nstock. Following is the standard language:\nConversion: The holders of the Series A Preferred shall have the\nright to convert the Series A Preferred, at any time, into shares\nof Common Stock. The initial conversion rate shall be 1:1, subject to adjustment as provided below.\nAs we discussed in the liquidation preferences section, this allows\nthe buyers of preferred to convert to common should they determine on a liquidation that they would be better off getting paid on\nan as-converted common basis rather than accepting the liquidation\npreference and the participation amount. It can also be used in certain extreme circumstances whereby the preferred wants to control\na vote of the common on a certain issue. Note, however, that once\nconverted, there is no provision for reconverting back to preferred.\nA more interesting term is the automatic conversion, especially\nsince it has several components that are negotiable.\nAutomatic Conversion: All of the Series A Preferred shall be\nautomatically converted into Common Stock, at the then applicable conversion price, upon the closing of a firmly underwritten public offering of shares of Common Stock of the Company\nat a per share price not less than [three] times the Original Purchase Price (as adjusted for stock splits, dividends, and the like)\nper share and for a total offering of not less than [$15] million\n(before deduction of underwriters’ commissions and expenses)\n(a “Qualified IPO”). All, or a portion of each share, of the Series\nA Preferred shall be automatically converted into Common\nStock, at the then applicable conversion price in the event that\nthe holders of at least a majority of the outstanding Series A Preferred consent to such conversion.\nIn an IPO of a venture-backed company, the investment bankers will almost always want to see everyone convert into common\nstock at the time of the IPO. It is rare for a venture-backed company\nto go public with multiple classes of stock, although occasionally\nyou will see dual classes of shares in an IPO as Google had. The\nthresholds for the automatic conversion are critical to negotiate. As\nwww.itdf.ir\nControl Terms of the Term Sheet 79\nthe entrepreneur you want them lower to ensure more fl exibility,\nwhereas your investors will want them higher to give them more\ncontrol over the timing and terms of an IPO.\n Regardless of the actual thresholds, it’s important to never allow\ninvestors to negotiate different automatic conversion terms for different series of preferred stock. There are many horror stories of\ncompanies on the brink of going public with one class of preferred\nstockholders having a threshold above what the proposed offering\nwould result in; as a result, these stockholders have an effective veto\nright on the offering.\n For example, assume that you have an early-stage investor with\nan automatic conversion threshold of $30 million and a later-stage\ninvestor with an automatic conversion threshold of $60 million. Now,\nassume you are at the goal line for an IPO and it’s turning out to be\na $50 million offering based on the market and the demand for your\ncompany. Your early investor is ready to go, but your later-stage investor suddenly says, “I’d like a little something else since I can block\nthe deal and even though you’ve done all of this work to get to an\nIPO, I don’t think I can support it unless . . .” In these cases, much\nlast-minute legal and fi nancial wrangling ensues given the lack of\nalignment between your different classes of investors. To avoid this,\nwe strongly recommend that you equalize the automatic conversion\nthreshold among all series of stock at each fi nancing.\nThe Entrepreneur’s Perspective\n Understand what the norms are for new IPOs before you dig your heels in on\nconversion terms. There’s no reason to negotiate away other more critical terms\nover a $20 million threshold versus a $30 million threshold if the norm is $50\nmillion. Besides, a board decision to pursue an IPO will put pressure on a VC to\nwaive this provision.\nwww.itdf.ir\n81\n6\nC h a p t e r\nOther erms of the erm Sheet\nUp to this point we’ve been exploring terms that matter a lot and\nfall under the category of economics or control. As we get further\ninto the term sheet, we start to encounter some terms that don’t\nmatter as much, are only impactful in a downside scenario, or don’t\nmatter at all.\nThis chapter covers those terms, which include dividends,\nredemption rights, conditions precedent to financing, information\nrights, registration rights, right of first refusal, voting rights, restriction on sales, proprietary information and inventions agreement,\nco-sale agreement, founders’ activities, initial public offering shares\npurchase, no-shop agreement, indemnification, and assignment.\nDividends\nWhereas private equity investors love dividends, most venture capitalists, especially early-stage ones, don’t really care about them. In\nour experience, the venture capitalists (VCs) who do care about dividends either come from a private equity background or are focused\non downside protection in larger deals.\nTypical dividend language in a term sheet follows:\nDividends: The holders of the Series A Preferred shall be entitled to receive [non]cumulative dividends in preference to any\ndividend on the Common Stock at the rate of [8%] of the Original Purchase Price per annum [when and as declared by the\nBoard of Directors]. The holders of Series A Preferred also shall\nVenture Deals: Be Smarter than Your Lawyer\nand Venture Capitalist, Third Edition\nBy Brad Feld and Jason Mendelson\nCopyright © 2016 by Brad Feld and Jason Mendelson\nwww.itdf.ir\n82 Venture Deals\nbe entitled to participate pro rata in any dividends paid on the\nCommon Stock on an as-if-converted basis.\nFor early-stage investments, dividends generally do not provide\nventure returns—they are simply additional juice in a deal. Let’s do\nsome simple math. Assume a typical dividend of 10% (dividends will\nrange from 5 to 15% depending on how aggressive your investor is;\nwe picked 10% to make the math easy).\nNow, assume that the VC has negotiated hard and gotten a 10%\ncumulative annual dividend. In this case, the VC automatically gets\nthe dividend every year. To keep the math simple, let’s assume the\ndividend does not compound. As a result, each year the VC gets 10%\nof the investment as a dividend. Assume a home run deal such as\na 50× return on a $10 million investment in five years. Even with a\n10% cumulative annual dividend, this increases the VC’s return from\n$500 million to only $505 million (the annual dividend is $1 million,\nor 10% of $10 million, times five years).\nWhile the extra money from the dividend is nice, it doesn’t really\nimpact the success case. Since venture funds typically have a 10-year\nlife, the dividend generates another 1× return only if you invest on\nday one of a fund and hold the investment for 10 years.\nThis also assumes the company can actually pay out the dividend.\nUsually the dividends can be paid in either stock or cash, typically at\nthe option of the company. Obviously, the dividend could drive additional dilution if it is paid out in stock, so this is the one case in which\nit is important not to get head-faked by the investor, where the dividend becomes another form of anti-dilution protection—one that is\nautomatic and simply linked to the passage of time.\nWe are being optimistic about the return scenarios. In downside cases, the dividend can matter, especially as the invested capital\nincreases. For example, take a $40 million investment with a 10%\nannual cumulative dividend in a company that was sold at the end\nof the fifth year to another company for $80 million. In this case,\nassume that there was a simple liquidation preference with no participation and the investor got 40% of the company for his investment (at a $100 million post-money valuation). Since the sale price\nwas below the investment post-money valuation (i.e., a loser, but not\na disaster), the investor will exercise the liquidation preference and\ntake the $40 million plus the dividend ($4 million per year for five\nyears, or $20 million). In this case, the difference between the return\nwww.itdf.ir\nOther terms of the term Sheet 83\nin a no-dividend scenario ($40 million) and a dividend scenario\n($60 million) is material.\n Mathematically, the larger the investment amount and the lower\nthe expected exit multiple, the more the dividend matters. This is\nwhy you see dividends in private equity and buyout deals where large\ninvestments are involved (typically greater than $50 million) and the\nexpectation for return multiples on invested capital is lower.\n Automatic dividends have some nasty side effects, especially if the\ncompany runs into trouble, since they typically should be included\nin the solvency analysis. If you aren’t paying attention, an automatic\ncumulative dividend can put you unknowingly into the zone of insolvency, which is a bad place to be. Cumulative dividends can also be\nan accounting nightmare, especially when they are optionally paid\nin stock, cash, or a conversion adjustment, but that’s why the accountants get paid the big bucks at the end of the year to put together the\naudited balance sheet.\n That said, the noncumulative dividend when declared by the\nboard is benign, rarely declared, and an artifact of the past, so\nwe typically leave it in term sheets just to give the lawyers something to do.\nthe entrepreneur’s perspective\n The thing to care about here is ensuring that dividends have to be approved by\na majority—or even a supermajority—of your board of directors.\nredemption rights\n Even though redemption rights rarely come into play, some VCs\nare often overly focused on them in the deal because they provide\nadditional downside protection. A typical redemption rights clause\nfollows:\n Redemption at Option of Investors: At the election of the holders of at least a majority of the Series A Preferred, the Company\nshall redeem the outstanding Series A Preferred in three annual\ninstallments beginning on the [fi fth] anniversary of the Closing.\nSuch redemptions shall be at a purchase price equal to the Original Purchase Price plus declared and unpaid dividends.\nwww.itdf.ir\n84 Venture Deals\nThere is some rationale for redemption rights. First, there is\nthe fear (on the VC’s part) that a company will become successful\nenough to be an ongoing business but not quite successful enough\nto go public or be acquired. In this case, redemption rights were\ninvented to allow the investor a guaranteed exit path. However, a\ncompany that is around for a while as a going concern while not\nbeing an attractive initial public offering (IPO) or acquisition candidate generally won’t have the cash to pay out redemption rights.\nAnother reason for redemption rights pertains to the life span\nof venture funds. The average venture fund has a 10-year life span\nto conduct its business. If a VC makes an investment in year five of\nthe fund, it might be important for that fund manager to secure\nredemption rights in order to have a liquidity path before the fund\nmust wind down. As with the previous case, whether or not the company has the ability to pay is another matter.\nOften, companies will claim that redemption rights create liabilities on their balance sheets and can make certain business optics\nmore difficult. By optics, we mean how certain third-parties view\nthe health and stability of the company such as bankers, customers, and employees. In the past few years, accountants have begun\nto argue more strongly that redeemable preferred stock is a liability on the balance sheet instead of an equity feature. Unless the\nredeemable preferred stock is mandatorily redeemable, this is not\nthe case, and most experienced accountants will be able to recognize the difference.\nThere is one form of redemption that we have seen in the past\nfew years that we view as overreaching—the adverse change redemption. We recommend you never agree to the following term that has\nrecently crept into term sheets:\nAdverse Change Redemption: Should the Company experience\na material adverse change to its prospects, business, or financial\nposition, the holders of at least a majority of the Series A Preferred shall have the option to commit the Company to immediately redeem the outstanding Series A Preferred. Such redemption shall be at a purchase price equal to the Original Purchase\nPrice plus declared and unpaid dividends.\nThis term effectively gives the VC a right to a redemption in the\ncase of a “material adverse change to its . . . business.” The problem\nwww.itdf.ir\nOther terms of the term Sheet 85\n Conditions precedent to Financing\n While there is a lot to negotiate, a term sheet is simply a step on\nthe way to an actual deal. Term sheets are often nonbinding (or\nmostly nonbinding) and most VCs will load them up with conditions\nprecedent to fi nancing. Entrepreneurs glance over these, usually\nbecause they are in the back sections of the term sheet and seem\npretty innocuous, but they occasionally have additional ways out of a\ndeal for the investor that the entrepreneur should watch for, if only\nto better understand the current mindset of the investor proposing\nthe investment.\n A typical conditions precedent to fi nancing clause looks like this:\n Conditions Precedent to Financing: Except for the provisions\ncontained herein entitled “Legal Fees and Expenses,” “No-Shop\nAgreement,” and “Governing Law,” which are explicitly agreed\nby the Investors and the Company to be binding upon execution of this term sheet, this summary of terms is not intended\nas a legally binding commitment by the Investors, and any obligation on the part of the Investors is subject to the following\nconditions precedent: 1. Completion of legal documentation\nthe entrepreneur’s perspective\n I don’t worry about redemption rights much, although the adverse change\nredemption clause is evil. As with dividends, just make sure you have maximum protection around your board, or all classes of preferred shareholders\nvoting in aggregate, and not just the majority of a random class of shareholder\ndeclaring these.\nis that “material adverse change” is not defi ned, is a vague concept,\nis too punitive, and shifts an inappropriate amount of control to\nthe investors based on an arbitrary judgment of the investors. If this\nterm is being proposed and you are getting resistance on eliminating it, make sure you are speaking to a professional investor and not\na loan shark.\n In our experience, redemption rights are well understood by\nVCs and should not create a problem, except in a theoretical argument between lawyers and accountants.\nwww.itdf.ir\n86 Venture Deals\nsatisfactory to the prospective Investors; 2. Satisfactory completion of due diligence by the prospective Investors; 3. Delivery of a\ncustomary management rights letter to Investors; and 4. Submission of a detailed budget for the following twelve (12) months,\nacceptable to Investors.\n Note that the investors will try to make a few things binding—\nspecifi cally that legal fees get paid whether or not a deal happens,\nthe company can’t shop the deal once the term sheet is signed, or\nthe governing law be set to a specifi c domicile—while explicitly stating that a bunch of things still have to happen before this deal is\ndone, and they can back out for any reason.\nthe entrepreneur’s perspective\n Try to avoid conditions precedent to \u001f nancing as much as possible. Again, the\nbest Plan A has the strongest Plan B standing behind it. Your prospective VC\nshould be willing to move quickly and snap up your deal on acceptable terms\nby the time the VC gets to a term sheet. At a minimum, do not agree to pay for\nthe VC’s legal fees unless the deal is completed (with a possible carve-out for\nyou canceling the deal).\n There are three conditions to watch out for since they usually\nsignal something nonobvious on the part of the VC. They are:\n 1. Approval by investors’ partnerships. This is secret VC code for\n“This deal has not been approved by the investors who issued\nthis term sheet.” Therefore, even if you love the terms of\nthe deal, you still may not have a deal. Note that we’ve seen\ncases where this isn’t explicitly put in the term sheet but is\nstill the case. When signing a term sheet, always ask your VC\nwhether the terms have been approved by the partnership\nor if there is another approval step in the process. Be cautious of agreeing to go forward exclusively with a VC in situations where you still have additional approval steps in their\npartnership process.\n 2. Rights offering to be completed by company . This indicates that the\nVCs want to offer all previous investors in the company the\nability to participate in the currently contemplated fi nancing. This is not necessarily a bad thing, as in most cases it\nwww.itdf.ir\nOther terms of the term Sheet 87\nserves to protect all parties from liability, but it does add time\nand expense to the deal.\n 3. Employment agreements signed by founders as acceptable to investors .\nBe aware of what the full terms are before signing the agreement. As an entrepreneur, when faced with this, it’s probably\nwise to understand and negotiate the form of employment\nagreement early in the process. You’ll want to try to do this\nbefore you sign a term sheet and accept a no-shop clause,\nbut most VCs will wave you off and say, “Don’t worry about\nit—we’ll come up with something that works for everyone.”\nMake sure you understand the key terms such as compensation and what happens if you get fi red.\nthe entrepreneur’s perspective\n Insist on spelling out key terms prior to a signed term sheet if it has a no-shop\nclause in it. A VC who won’t spell out key employment terms at the beginning\nis a big red \u001e ag.\n There are plenty of other wacky conditions—if you can dream it\nup, it has probably been done. Just make sure to look carefully at this\nparagraph and remember that you don’t necessarily have a deal just\nbecause you’ve signed a term sheet.\nInformation rights\n We are back to another ubiquitous term that is important to the VC\nbut shouldn’t matter much to the entrepreneur. Information rights\ndefi ne the type of information the VC legally has access to and the\ntime frame in which the company is required to deliver it to the VC.\n Information Rights: So long as an Investor continues to hold\n[any] shares of Series A Preferred or Common Stock issued\nupon conversion of the Series A Preferred, the Company shall\ndeliver to the Investor the Company’s annual budget, as well as\naudited annual and unaudited quarterly fi nancial statements.\nFurthermore, as soon as reasonably possible, the Company shall\nfurnish a report to each Investor comparing each annual budget\nto such fi nancial statements. Each Investor shall also be entitled\nwww.itdf.ir\n88 Venture Deals\nto standard inspection and visitation rights. These provisions\nshall terminate upon a Qualifi ed IPO.\n You might ask, “If these terms rarely matter, why bother?” Since\nyou will end up having to deal with them in a VC term sheet, you\nmight as well be exposed to them and hear that they don’t matter\nmuch. Of course, from a VC perspective, “doesn’t matter much” can\nalso mean “Mr. Entrepreneur, please don’t pay much attention to\nthese terms—just accept them as is.” However, our view is that if an\ninvestor or the company is hotly negotiating this particular term,\nthat time (and lawyer money) is most likely being wasted.\n Information rights are generally something companies are stuck\nwith in order to get investment capital. The only variation one sees\nis a threshold on the number of shares held (some fi nite number\nversus “any”) for investors to continue to enjoy these rights.\nthe entrepreneur’s perspective\n If you care about information rights for your shareholders, you are nuts. You\nshould run a transparent organization as much as possible in the twenty-\u001f rst\ncentury. If you can’t commit to sending your shareholders a budget and \u001f nancial\nstatements, you shouldn’t take on outside investors. If you are of the paranoid\nmindset (which I generally applaud), feel free to insist on a strict con\u001f dentiality\nclause to accompany your information rights.\nregistration rights\n Registration rights defi ne the rights that investors have to registering\ntheir shares in an IPO scenario as well as the obligation of the company to the VCs whenever they fi le additional registration statements\nafter the IPO. This is a tedious example of something that rarely\nmatters, yet tends to take up a page or more of the term sheet. Get\nready for your mind to be numbed.\n Registration Rights: Demand Rights: If Investors holding more\nthan 50% of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred, including Common Stock issued on conversion of Series A Preferred\n(“Registrable Securities”), or a lesser percentage if the anticipated aggregate offering price to the public is not less than\nwww.itdf.ir\nOther erms of the erm Sheet 89\n$5 million, request that the Company file a Registration Statement, the Company will use its best efforts to cause such shares to\nbe registered; provided, however, that the Company shall not be\nobligated to effect any such registration prior to the [third] anniversary of the Closing. The Company shall have the right to delay\nsuch registration under certain circumstances for one period not\nin excess of ninety (90) days in any twelve (12)-month period.\nThe Company shall not be obligated to effect more than two\n(2) registrations under these demand right provisions, and shall\nnot be obligated to effect a registration (i) during the one hundred eighty (180)-day period commencing with the date of the\nCompany’s initial public offering, or (ii) if it delivers notice to\nthe holders of the Registrable Securities within thirty (30) days\nof any registration request of its intent to file a registration statement for such initial public offering within ninety (90) days.\nCompany Registration: The Investors shall be entitled to “piggyback” registration rights on all registrations of the Company or\non any demand registrations of any other investor subject to the\nright, however, of the Company and its underwriters to reduce\nthe number of shares proposed to be registered pro rata in view\nof market conditions. If the Investors are so limited, however, no\nparty shall sell shares in such registration other than the Company or the Investor, if any, invoking the demand registration.\nUnless the registration is with respect to the Company’s initial\npublic offering, in no event shall the shares to be sold by the\nInvestors be reduced below 30% of the total amount of securities included in the registration. No shareholder of the Company shall be granted piggyback registration rights which would\nreduce the number of shares includable by the holders of the\nRegistrable Securities in such registration without the consent\nof the holders of at least a majority of the Registrable Securities.\nS-3 Rights: Investors shall be entitled to unlimited demand registrations on Form S-3 (if available to the Company) so long as\nsuch registered offerings are not less than $1 million.\nExpenses: The Company shall bear registration expenses\n(exclusive of underwriting discounts and commissions) of all\nsuch demands, piggybacks, and S-3 registrations (including the\nexpense of one special counsel of the selling shareholders not\nto exceed $25,000).\nwww.itdf.ir\n90 Venture Deals\nTransfer of Rights: The registration rights may be transferred to\n(i) any partner, member, or retired partner or member or affiliated fund of any holder which is a partnership, (ii) any member\nor former member of any holder which is a limited liability company, (iii) any family member or trust for the benefit of any individual holder, or (iv) any transferee who satisfies the criteria to\nbe a Major Investor (as defined below); provided the Company\nis given written notice thereof.\nLockup Provision: Each Investor agrees that it will not sell its\nshares for a period to be specified by the managing underwriter\n(but not to exceed 180 days) following the effective date of the\nCompany’s initial public offering; provided that all officers,\ndirectors, and other 1% shareholders are similarly bound. Such\nlockup agreement shall provide that any discretionary waiver or\ntermination of the restrictions of such agreements by the Company or representatives of underwriters shall apply to Major\nInvestors, pro rata, based on the number of shares held.\nOther Provisions: Other provisions shall be contained in the\nInvestor Rights Agreement with respect to registration rights as\nare reasonable, including cross-indemnification, the period of\ntime in which the Registration Statement shall be kept effective, and underwriting arrangements. The Company shall not\nrequire the opinion of Investor’s counsel before authorizing the\ntransfer of stock or the removal of Rule 144 legends for routine\nsales under Rule 144 or for distribution to partners or members\nof Investors.\nRegistration rights are something the company will almost always\nhave to offer to investors. What is most interesting about registration\nrights is that lawyers seem genetically incapable of leaving this section untouched and always end up negotiating something. Perhaps\nbecause this provision is so long, they feel the need to keep their pens\nwarm while reading. We find it humorous (as long as we aren’t the\nones paying the legal fees) because, in the end, the modifications are\ngenerally innocuous, and besides, if you ever get to the point where\nregistration rights come into play (e.g., an IPO), the investment bankers of the company are going to have a major hand in deciding how\nthe deal is going to be structured, regardless of the contract the company entered into years before when it did an early-stage financing.\nwww.itdf.ir\nOther terms of the term Sheet 91\n right of First refusal\n The right of fi rst refusal defi nes the rights that an investor has to buy\nshares in a future fi nancing. Right of fi rst refusal is another chewy term\nthat takes up a lot of space in the term sheet but is hard for the entrepreneur to have much impact on. Following is the typical language:\n Right of First Refusal: Prior to a Qualifi ed IPO, Major Investors\nshall have the right to purchase their pro rata portions (calculated\non a fully diluted basis) of any future issuances of equity securities by the Company (with overallotment rights in the event a\nMajor Investor does not purchase its full allocation), other than\n(i) shares or options to purchase shares issued to employees, consultants or directors as approved by the Board, (ii) shares issued\nfor consideration other than cash pursuant to a merger, consolidation, acquisition, or similar business combination approved by\nthe Board; (iii) shares issued pursuant to any equipment loan or\nleasing arrangement, real property leasing arrangement or debt\nfi nancing from a bank or similar fi nancial institution approved by\nthe Board; and (iv) other issuances approved by the Required Percentage of the outstanding Series A Preferred from time to time.\n The right of fi rst refusal is also known as a pro rata right. While\nalmost all VCs will insist on a right of fi rst refusal, there are two things\nto pay attention to in this term that can be negotiated. First, the share\nthreshold that defi nes a major investor can be defi ned. It’s often convenient, especially if you have a large number of small investors, not to\nhave to give this right to them. However, since in future rounds you are\ntypically interested in getting as much participation from your existing\ninvestors as you can, it’s not worth struggling with this too much.\n A more important thing to watch for is a multiple on the purchase rights (e.g., the “[X] times” listed). This is often referred to\nas a super pro rata right and is an excessive ask, especially early in the\nfi nancing life cycle of a company.\nthe entrepreneur’s perspective\n Don’t focus much energy on registration rights. This is more about upside. The\nworld is good if you’re going public.\nwww.itdf.ir\n92 Venture Deals\nVoting rights\n Voting rights defi ne how the preferred stock and the common stock\nrelate to each other in the context of a share vote. It is another term\nthat doesn’t matter that much. The typical language follows:\n Voting Rights: The Series A Preferred will vote together with\nthe Common Stock and not as a separate class except as specifi cally provided herein or as otherwise required by law. The\nCommon Stock may be increased or decreased by the vote of\nholders of a majority of the Common Stock and Series A Preferred voting together on an as-if-converted basis, and without\na separate class vote. Each share of Series A Preferred shall\nhave a number of votes equal to the number of shares of Common Stock then issuable upon conversion of such share of\nSeries A Preferred.\n Most of the time the voting rights clause is simply an FYI section,\nas all the important rights, such as the protective provisions, are contained in other sections.\n restriction on Sales\n The restriction on sales clause, also known as the right of fi rst refusal\non sales of common stock (or ROFR on common), defi nes the\nparameters associated with selling shares of stock when the company\nis a private company. Typical language follows:\n Restrictions on Sales: The Company’s Bylaws shall contain a\nright of fi rst refusal on all transfers of Common Stock, subject\nto normal exceptions. If the Company elects not to exercise its\nright, the Company shall assign its right to the Investors.\nthe entrepreneur’s perspective\n The right of \u001f rst refusal is not a big deal, and in some cases it’s good for you.\nBut make sure you de\u001f ne what a major investor is and give this only to them. At\na minimum, you can make sure that shareholders get this right only if they play\nin subsequent rounds.\nwww.itdf.ir\nOther erms of the erm Sheet 93\nHistorically, founders and management rarely argue against this,\nas it helps control the shareholder base of the company, which usually benefits all the existing shareholders (except possibly the ones\nwho want to bail out of their private stock). However, we’ve found\nthat the lawyers will often spend time arguing about how to implement this particular clause—specifically whether to include it in the\nbylaws or include it in each of the company’s option agreements,\nplans, and stock sales. We find it easier to include this clause in the\nbylaws since then it’s in one place and is hard to overlook.\nIn the early days of venture capital (say, until 2007) there was\na strong conventional wisdom that founders and management\nshouldn’t be able to sell their shares until the investors could sell their\nshares, through either an IPO or a sale of the company. As the time\nto liquidity for private companies stretched out and IPOs became less\ncommon, this philosophy shifted. Simultaneously, a healthy secondary market for founders and early employee shares appeared, fueled\nboth by the rapid rise in valuation of private companies such as Facebook, Uber, Airbnb, and Twitter, along with the emergence of private\nsecondary markets such as Second Market and SharesPost. The result\nis a lot more sales of private stock to other investors (sometimes new\nones, sometimes the existing investors) along with more scrutiny and\ndiscussion around the ROFR on common construct.\nAfter being involved in several situations where this has come\ninto play, we feel more strongly than ever that an ROFR on common\nis a good thing for the company and should be supported by the\nfounders, management, and investors. Controlling the share ownership in a private company is important, especially as the Securities\nand Exchange Commission (SEC) takes a closer look at various private shareholder rules—both regarding ownership and stock sales.\nThe ROFR on common gives the company the ability to at least\nknow what is going on and make decisions in the context of the\nvarious proposals.\nroprietary Information and Inventions greement\nEvery term sheet we’ve ever seen has a proprietary information and\ninventions agreement clause. The typical language follows:\nProprietary Information and Inventions Agreement: Each current\nand former officer, employee, and consultant of the Company\nwww.itdf.ir\n94 Venture Deals\nshall enter into an acceptable proprietary information and inventions agreement.\n This paragraph benefi ts both the company and investors and is\nsimply a mechanism that investors use to get the company to legally\nstand behind the representation that it owns its intellectual property (IP). Many pre–Series A companies have issues surrounding\nthis, especially if the company hasn’t had great legal representation\nprior to its fi rst venture round. We’ve also run into plenty of situations (including several of ours—oops!) in which companies are\nloose about this between fi nancings, and while a fi nancing is a good\ntime to clean this up, it’s often annoying to previously hired employees who are now told, “Hey—you need to sign this since we need\nit for the venture fi nancing.” It’s even more important in the sale\nof a company, as the buyer will always insist on clear ownership of\nthe IP. Our best advice here is that companies should build these\nagreements into their hiring process from the very beginning (with\nthe advice from a good law fi rm) so that there are never any issues\naround this, as VCs will always insist on this agreement.\nthe entrepreneur’s perspective\n A proprietary information and inventions agreement clause is good for the company. You should have all employees, including founders, sign something like\nthis before you do an outside venture \u001f nancing. If someone on the team needs\na speci\u001f c carve-out for work in progress that is unrelated to the business, you\nand your investors should be willing to grant it.\nCo-Sale agreement\n Most investors will insist on a co-sale agreement, which states that if\na founder sells shares, the investors will have an opportunity to sell a\nproportional amount of their stock as well. Typical language follows:\n Co-Sale Agreement: The shares of the Company’s securities\nheld by the Founders shall be made subject to a co-sale agreement (with certain reasonable exceptions) with the Investors\nsuch that the Founders may not sell, transfer, or exchange their\nstock unless each Investor has an opportunity to participate in\nwww.itdf.ir\nOther terms of the term Sheet 95\nFounders’ activities\n As you wind your way through a typical term sheet, you’ll often see,\nburied near the back, a short clause concerning founders’ activities.\nIt usually looks something like this:\n Founders’ Activities: Each of the Founders shall devote 100% of\nhis professional time to the Company. Any other professional\nactivities will require the approval of the Board of Directors.\n It should be no surprise to a founder that your friendly neighborhood VC wants you to be spending 100% (actually 120%) of\nyour professional time and attention on your company. If this paragraph sneaks its way into the term sheet, the VC either has recently\nbeen burned, is suspicious, or is concerned that one or more of the\nfounders may be working on something besides the company being\nfunded. Or in our case, we just put in it to see if anyone pushes back\non it. If someone does, it starts an interesting conversation.\n Of course, this is a classic no-win situation for a founder. If you\nare actually working on something else at the same time and don’t\ndisclose it, you are violating the terms of the agreement in addition\nto breaching trust before you get started. If you do disclose other\nactivities or push back on this clause (hence signaling that you are\nthe entrepreneur’s perspective\n Your chances of eliminating the co-sale agreement clause may be zero, but\nthere’s no reason not to ask for a \u001e oor to it. If you or your cofounders want to sell\na small amount of stock to buy a house, why should a VC hold it up? A right of\n\u001f rst refusal on the purchase with a bona \u001f de outside offer’s valuation as the purchase price is one thing. An effective exclusion is something entirely different.\nthe sale on a pro rata basis. This right of co-sale shall not apply\nto and shall terminate upon a Qualifi ed IPO.\n The chance of keeping this provision out of a fi nancing is close\nto zero, so we don’t think it’s worth fi ghting it. Notice that this matters only while the company is private—if the company goes public,\nthis clause no longer applies.\nwww.itdf.ir\n96 Venture Deals\nworking on something else), you’ll reinforce the concern that the\nVC has. So tread carefully here. Our recommendation, unless of\ncourse you are working on something else, is simply to agree to this.\n In situations where we’ve worked with a founder who already\nhas other obligations or commitments, we’ve always appreciated her\nbeing up front with us early in the process. We’ve usually been able\nto work through these situations in a way that results in everyone\nbeing happy, and in the cases where we couldn’t get there, were glad\nthat the issue came up early so that we didn’t waste our time or the\nentrepreneur’s time.\n While there are situations where VCs get comfortable with entrepreneurs working on multiple companies simultaneously (usually\nwith very experienced entrepreneurs or in situations where the VC\nand the entrepreneur have worked together in the past), they are a\nrare exception, not the norm.\nthe entrepreneur’s perspective\n If you can’t agree to a founders’ activities clause, don’t look for professional\nVC \u001f nancing. Or you can negotiate a very speci\u001f c carve-out, and expect other\nconsequences in your terms (e.g., vesting and IP rights).\n Initial public Offering Shares purchase\n One of the terms that falls into the “nice problem to have” category is\nthe initial public offering shares purchase. The typical language follows:\n Initial Public Offering Shares Purchase: In the event that the\nCompany shall consummate a Qualifi ed IPO, the Company shall\nuse its best efforts to cause the managing underwriter or underwriters of such IPO to offer to [investors] the right to purchase\nat least [5%] of any shares issued under a “friends and family”\nor “directed shares” program in connection with such Qualifi ed\nIPO. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all action taken pursuant\nto this Section shall be made in accordance with all federal and\nstate securities laws, including, without limitation, Rule 134 of the\nSecurities Act of 1933, as amended, and all applicable rules and\nregulations promulgated by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. and other such self-regulating organizations.\nwww.itdf.ir\nOther erms of the erm Sheet 97\nThis term blossomed in the late 1990s when anything that was\nVC funded was positioned as a company that would shortly go public. However, most investment bankers will push back on this term\nif the IPO is going to be a success, as they want to get stock into\nthe hands of institutional investors (their clients). If the VCs get this\npush-back, they are usually so giddy with joy that the company is\ngoing public that they don’t argue with the bankers. Ironically, if\nthey don’t get this push-back, or even worse, get a call near the end\nof the IPO road show in which the bankers are asking them to buy\nshares in the offering, they usually panic and do whatever they can\nto not have to buy into the offering since this means the deal is no\nlonger a hot one.\nOur recommendation on this one is don’t worry about it or\nspend lawyer time on it.\nNo-Shop greement\nAs an entrepreneur, the way to get the best deal for a round of financing is to have multiple options. However, there comes a point in time\nwhen you have to choose your investor and shift from “search for an\ninvestor” mode to “close the deal” mode. Part of this involves choosing your lead investor and negotiating the final term sheet with him.\nA no-shop agreement is almost always part of this final term\nsheet. Think of it as serial monogamy—your new investor-to-be\ndoesn’t want you running around behind his back just as you are\nabout to get hitched. A typical no-shop agreement follows:\nNo-Shop Agreement: The Company agrees to work in good faith\nexpeditiously toward a closing. The Company and the Founders\nagree that they will not, directly or indirectly, (i) take any action\nto solicit, initiate, encourage, or assist the submission of any proposal, negotiation, or offer from any person or entity other than\nthe Investors relating to the sale or issuance of any of the capital\nstock of the Company or the acquisition, sale, lease, license, or\nother disposition of the Company or any material part of the\nstock or assets of the Company, or (ii) enter into any discussions\nor negotiations or execute any agreement related to any of the\nforegoing, and shall notify the Investors promptly of any inquiries by any third parties in regard to the foregoing. Should both\nparties agree that definitive documents shall not be executed\nwww.itdf.ir\n98 Venture Deals\npursuant to this term sheet, then the Company shall have no\nfurther obligations under this section.\nAt some level the no-shop agreement, like serial monogamy,\nis more of an emotional commitment than a legal one. While it’s\nvery hard, but not impossible, to enforce a no-shop agreement in a\nfinancing, if you get caught cheating, your financing will probably\ngo the same way as the analogous situation when the groom or the\nbride-to-be gets caught in a compromising situation.\nThe no-shop agreement reinforces the handshake that says,\n“Okay, let’s get a deal done—no more fooling around looking for a\nbetter or different one.” In all cases, the entrepreneur should bound\nthe no-shop agreement by a time period—usually 45 to 60 days is\nplenty, although you can occasionally get a VC to agree to a 30-day\nno-shop agreement. This makes the commitment bidirectional—you\nagree not to shop the deal; the VC agrees to get things done within\na reasonable time frame.\nNow, some entrepreneurs still view that as a unilateral agreement;\nnamely, the entrepreneur is agreeing to the no-shop but the VC isn’t\nreally agreeing to anything at all. In most cases, we don’t view the noshop clause as terribly important since it can be bounded with time.\nInstead, we feel it’s much more important for the entrepreneur to\ntest the VCs commitment to follow through on the investment when\nsigning up to do the deal.\nSpecifically, in some cases VCs put down term sheets early, well\nbefore they’ve got internal agreement within their partnership to\ndo an investment. This used to be more common; today many earlystage VCs don’t want to go through the hassle of drafting the term\nsheet and trying to negotiate it unless they believe they will do the\ndeal. In addition, there is a potential negative reputational impact\nfor the VC, as word will get around that VC X puts term sheets out\nearly, but then can’t or won’t close. In the age of the Internet, this\ntype of reputation spreads like an infectious disease.\nAlthough we’ve done hundreds of investments, we’ve only seen\na few situations where the no-shop agreement had any meaningful impact on a deal in which we were involved. When we thought\nabout the situations in which we were the VC and were negatively\nimpacted by not having a no-shop agreement (e.g., a company we\nhad agreed with on a term sheet went and did something else) or\nwhere we were on the receiving end of a no-shop agreement and\nwww.itdf.ir\nOther erms of the erm Sheet 99\nwere negatively impacted by it (e.g., an acquirer tied us up but then\nultimately didn’t close on the deal), we actually didn’t feel particularly bad about any of the situations since there was both logic associated with the outcome and grace exhibited by the participants.\nFollowing are two examples:\nWe signed a term sheet to invest in Company X. We didn’t\ninclude a no-shop clause in the term sheet. We were working to\nclose the investment (we were 15 days into a 30-ish-day process) and\nhad legal documents going back and forth. One of the founders\ncalled us and said that they had just received an offer to be acquired\nand they wanted to pursue it. We told them no problem—we’d still\nbe there to do the deal if it didn’t come together. We were very\nopen with them about the pros and cons of doing the deal from our\nperspective and, given the economics, encouraged them to pursue\nthe acquisition offer (it was a great deal for them). They ended up\nclosing the deal and, as a token, gave us a small amount of equity\nin the company for our efforts (totally unexpected and unnecessary\nbut appreciated).\nIn another situation we were already investors in a company that\nwas in the process of closing an outside-led round at a significant\nstep-up in valuation. The company was under a no-shop agreement\nwith the new VC. A week prior to closing, we received an acquisition overture from one of the strategic investors in the company.\nWe immediately told the new lead investor about it, who graciously\nagreed to suspend the no-shop agreement and wait to see whether\nwe wanted to move forward with the acquisition or with the financing. We negotiated with the acquirer for several weeks, checking\nregularly with the new potential investor to make sure they were\nstill interested in closing the round if we chose not to pursue the\nacquisition. They were incredibly supportive and patient. The company covered its legal fees up to that point (unprompted—although\nit was probably in the term sheet that we’d cover them; we can’t\nrecall). We ended up moving forward with the acquisition; the new\ninvestor was disappointed in the outcome but happy and supportive\nof what we did.\nWhile both of these are edge cases, in almost all of our experiences the no-shop agreement ended up being irrelevant. As each of\nthese examples shows, the quality and the character of the people\ninvolved made all the difference and were much more important\nthan the legal term.\nwww.itdf.ir\n100 Venture Deals\nIndemnifi cation\n The indemnifi cation clause states that the company will indemnify\ninvestors and board members to the maximum extent possible by law.\nIt is another one that entrepreneurs just have to live with. It follows:\n Indemnifi cation: The bylaws and/or other charter documents\nof the Company shall limit board members’ liability and exposure to damages to the broadest extent permitted by applicable law. The Company will indemnify board members and will\nindemnify each Investor for any claims brought against the\nInvestors by any third party (including any other shareholder of\nthe Company) as a result of this fi nancing.\n Given all of the shareholder litigation in recent years, there is\nalmost no chance that a company will get funded without indemnifying its directors. The fi rst sentence is simply a contractual obligation\nbetween the company and its board. The second sentence, which\nis occasionally negotiable, indicates the desire for the company to\npurchase formal liability insurance. One can usually negotiate away\ninsurance in a Series A deal, but for any follow-on fi nancing the\nmajor practice today is to procure directors’ and offi cers’ (D&O)\ninsurance. We believe companies should be willing to indemnify\ntheir directors and will likely need to purchase D&O insurance in\norder to attract outside board members.\nthe entrepreneur’s perspective\n As an entrepreneur, you should also ask that the no-shop clause expire immediately if the VC terminates the process. Also, consider asking for a carveout for acquisitions. Frequently \u001f nancings and acquisitions follow each other\naround. Even if you’re not looking to be acquired, you don’t want handcuffs on\nconversations about an acquisition just because a VC is negotiating with you\nabout a \u001f nancing.\nthe entrepreneur’s perspective\n You should have reasonable and customary D&O insurance for yourself as much\nas for your VCs. While the indemni\u001f cation clause is good corporate hygiene,\nmake sure you follow it up with an appropriate insurance policy.\nwww.itdf.ir\nOther erms of the erm Sheet 101\nssignment\nWe end this chapter with the assignment clause, another clause in\na typical term sheet that isn’t worth spending legal time and money\nnegotiating.\nAssignment: Each of the Investors shall be entitled to transfer\nall or part of its shares of Series A Preferred purchased by it to\none or more affiliated partnerships or funds managed by it or\nany of their respective directors, officers, or partners, provided\nsuch transferee agrees in writing to be subject to the terms of the\nStock Purchase Agreement and related agreements as if it were\na purchaser thereunder.\nThe assignment clause simply gives VC firms flexibility over transfers that they require to be able to run their business and, as long as\nthe VC is willing to require that any transferee agree to be subject\nto the various financing agreements, the company should be willing\nto provide for this. However, watch out for one thing—don’t let the\nloophole “assignment without transfer of the obligation under the\nagreements” occur. You need to make sure that anyone who is on\nthe receiving end of a transfer abides by the same rules and conditions that the original purchasers of the stock signed up for.\nwww.itdf.ir\n103\n7\nC h a p t e r\nhe Capitalization able\nNow that we’ve worked through all of the specific clauses in the\nterm sheet, let’s go through how a typical capitalization table (cap\ntable) works. A term sheet will almost always contain a summary\ncap table, which we describe in this chapter. You, your prospective\ninvestors, or occasionally your lawyers will generate a more detailed\ncap table.\nThe cap table summarizes who owns what part of the company\nbefore and after the financing. This is one area that some founders,\nespecially those who have not been exposed in the past to cap table\nmath, are often uncomfortable with. It’s extremely important for\nfounders to understand exactly who owns what part of a company\nand what the implications are in a potential funding round.\nNormally when you initially set up the company, 100% will be\nallocated to the founders and employees, with a specific number of\nshares allocated to each individual. The question “What will I own\nif a venture capitalist invests X in my company at a Y valuation?” is\nrarely simple. To answer it, you need to be able to generate a cap\ntable to truly analyze the deal presented by a particular term sheet.\nFollowing is a model to work from with a typical example.\nLet’s assume the following:\n2 million shares held by founders before the VC invests\n$10 million pre-money valuation\n$5 million investment by the VC\nVenture Deals: Be Smarter than Your Lawyer\nand Venture Capitalist, Third Edition\nBy Brad Feld and Jason Mendelson\nCopyright © 2016 by Brad Feld and Jason Mendelson\nwww.itdf.ir\n104 Venture Deals\nIn this example, the post-money valuation is $15 million ($10 million pre-money + $5 million investment). Consequently, the VCs\nown 33.33% of the company after the financing ($5 million investment/$15 million post-money valuation). This should be pretty\nstraightforward so far.\nNow, assume the term sheet includes a new employee option\npool of 20% on a post-money basis. Remember that this means that\nafter the financing, there will be an unallocated option pool equal\nto 20% of the company.\nAlthough the post-money valuation remains the same ($15 million), the requirement for a 20% option pool will have a significant\nimpact on the ownership of the founders. Per the cap table, you\ncan see how we calculate the percentage ownership for each class\nof owner, along with the price per share of the preferred stock. To\nstart, we’ve filled in the known numbers and now have to solve for\nthe unknowns (A, B, C, D, and E).\nFirst, let’s solve for A, the founders’ ownership percentage: A =\n100% minus the VC percentage minus the employee pool percentage, or 100% – 33.33% – 20% = 46.67%. Given that we know that the\n2 million founders’ shares represent 46.67% of the company, we can\ndetermine that the total shares outstanding (E = 2 million/0.4667)\nare 4,285,408. Now, if there are 4,285,408 shares outstanding, determining the number of shares in the employee pool becomes B = E\n∗0.20 or 857,081.\nThe same math applies for C, the number of shares of preferred\nstock the VCs have. C = E ∗ 0.3333 or 1,428,326. Since $5 million\nbought 1,428,326 shares of preferred stock, then the price per share\nof preferred stock (D = $5 million/1,428,326) is $3.50 per share.\nFinally, always check your calculation. Since we know we have a\n$10 million pre-money valuation, then the shares prior to the financing (2 million founders’ shares plus the 20% option pool) times the\nprice per share should equal $10 million. If you do this math, you’ll\nxample Capitalization able\nClass Shares Preferred Price Valuation Percentage\nFounders 2,000,000 A\nEmployee pool B 20%\nVenture investors C D $5,000,000 33.33%\nTotal E D $15,000,000 100%\nwww.itdf.ir\nthe Capitalization table 105\nsee that (2 million + 857,081) * $3.50 = $9,999,783.50. Oops, we are\noff by $216.50, which represents 62 shares (well, 61.857 shares).\n While this is close enough for an example, it’s not close enough\nfor most VCs, or for most lawyers for that matter. And it shouldn’t\nbe close enough for you. That’s why most cap tables have two additional signifi cant digits (or fractional shares)—the rounding to the\nnearest share doesn’t happen during intermediate steps but only at\nthe very end.\n As the entrepreneur, you shouldn’t blindly rely on legal counsel\nto generate these documents. There are a lot of good lawyers out\nthere with poor math skills, and the cap table can get messed up\nwhen left in the hands of the lawyers. Although some get it right, it’s\nyour responsibility as the entrepreneur to make sure you understand\nyour cap table. This will be especially helpful at times when you want\nto expand the employee option pool and you are eloquent in front\nof your board of directors explaining the ramifi cations.\nthe entrepreneur’s perspective\n If you do not have a great fi nancially oriented founder, fi nd someone who\nknows what she’s doing to help you with the cap table—not just someone who\nknows math (a good starting point!), but someone who knows cap tables and\nVC fi nancings.\nwww.itdf.ir\n107\n8\nC h a p t e r\nConvertible Debt\nIn the past few chapters we’ve gone through, in detail, the terms\nin a typical venture capital equity financing. However, there is one\nother type of financing, often used at the seed stage, called a convertible debt financing. In fact, many angel investors will invest only\nwith this structure.\nConvertible debt is just that: debt. It’s a loan. The loan will convert to equity (preferred stock, usually) at such time as another\nround is raised. The conversion usually includes some sort of discount on the price to the future round.\nFor example, assume you raise $500,000 in convertible debt\nfrom angels with a 20% discount to the next round, and six months\nlater a venture capitalist (VC) offers to lead a Series A round of a\n$1 million investment at $1 a share. Your financing will actually be\nfor $1.5 million total, although the VCs will get 1 million Series A\nshares ($1 million at $1 per share) and the angels will get 625,000\nSeries A shares ($500,000 at $0.80 per share). The discount is appropriate, as your early investors want some reward for investing before\nthe full Series A financing round comes together.\nIn this chapter, we cover the arguments for and against using\nconvertible debt. We then go through the terms in a convertible\ndebt deal, including the discount, valuation caps, interest rate, conversion mechanics, conversion in a sale of the company, warrants,\nand other terms. We briefly cover the differences between early-stage\nand late-stage dynamics and finish up with an example of when convertible debt could be dangerous to use.\nVenture Deals: Be Smarter than Your Lawyer\nand Venture Capitalist, Third Edition\nBy Brad Feld and Jason Mendelson\nCopyright © 2016 by Brad Feld and Jason Mendelson\nwww.itdf.ir\n108 Venture Deals\nrguments For and gainst Convertible Debt\nMost fans of convertible debt argue that it’s a much easier transaction\nto complete than an equity financing. Since no valuation is being\nset for the company, you get to avoid that part of the negotiation.\nBecause it is debt, it has few, if any, of the rights of preferred stock\nofferings and you can accomplish a transaction with a lot less paperwork and legal fees. Note, however, that the legal fees argument is\nless persuasive these days with the many forms of standardized documents. A decade ago there could be a $50,000 pricing difference for\nlegal fees between a seed preferred round and a convertible debt\nround. These days the difference is less than $10,000 since many\nlawyers will heavily discount the seed preferred round to get future\nbusiness from the company.\nThe debate goes on endlessly about which structure is better or\nworse for entrepreneurs or investors. We aren’t convinced there is\na definitive answer here; in fact, we are convinced that those who\nthink there is a definitive answer are wrong.\nSince investors usually drive the decision about whether to raise\nan equity or a debt round, let’s look at their motivations first. One\nof the primary reasons for an early-stage investor to purchase equity\nis to price the stock being sold in the round. Early-stage investing\nis a risky proposition, and investors will want to invest at low prices,\nalthough smart investors won’t invest at a price at which founders\nare demotivated. As a result, most early-stage deals get priced in a\npretty tight range.\nWith a convertible debt structure, the stock price is not set and is\ndetermined at a later date when a larger financing occurs. By definition, if there is a later round the company must be doing something\nright. Having a discount is nice, but the ultimate price for the early\nconvertible debt investors may still be higher than what they would\nhave paid if they had bought equity in the first place. Some investors\ntry to fix this problem by setting a cap on the price they will pay in\nthe next round. In other words, as an investor, I’ll take a 20% discount on the price of the next round up to a valuation of $X. If you\nget a valuation above $X, then my valuation is $X (hence the notion\nof a valuation cap).\nThis sounds like it fixes the problem, right? This might for the\noriginal investor, but it might not for the company and the founders.\nFirst of all, the investors coming into the next round may not like the\nwww.itdf.ir\nConvertible Debt 109\nidea that they are paying that much more than the convertible debt\ninvestors paid. Unlike equity, which is issued and can’t be changed,\nthe new equity investors could refuse to fund unless the debt investors remove or change the cap. Keep in mind that VCs will normally\nfocus and peg their valuation of your company on that cap. You are\nessentially drawing a line in the sand (albeit a small one and in some\ncases it doesn’t actually affect the ultimate valuation) of what your\ncompany is worth in the future.\nFrom the entrepreneur’s standpoint, the choice isn’t clear,\neither. Some argue that the convertible debt structure, by definition,\nleads to a higher ultimate price for the first round. We won’t go as\nfar as to say they are right, but we can see the argument that with a\nconvertible debt feature you are allowing an inflated price based on\ntime to positively impact the valuation for the past investors. We’d\nargue that this is missing half of the analysis in that a founder’s first\ninvestors are sometimes the most important. These are the people\nwho invested in you at the riskiest stage before anyone else would.\nYou like them, you respect them, and you might even be related to\nthem. Assume that you create a lot of value along the way and the\nequity investor prices the round at a number that is higher than even\nyou expected. Your first investors will own less than anyone anticipated. At the end of the day, your biggest fans are happy about the\nfinancing, but sad that they own so little.\nBut does it really set a higher price? Let’s go back to the example\nof a convertible debt round with a cap. If we were going to agree to\nthis deal, our cap would be the price that we would have agreed to\nin an equity round. So, in effect, you’ve just sold the same amount\nof equity to us, but we have an option for the price to be lower than\nwe would have offered you since there are plenty of scenarios in\nwhich the equity price is below the cap amount. Why on earth would\nI agree to a cap that is above the price that I’m willing to pay today?\nThe cap amounts to a ceiling on your price. VCs will focus on that\ncap as well. There are plenty of situations where the VCs would have\nbeen willing to pay $X per share, but after seeing the cap number in\ndue diligence prior to a term sheet they offer only $Y (less than $X)\nper share because it’s within the cap. So while you may have gotten\na better deal on your seed round, your Series A round (which normally sees the company raising a lot more money than a seed round)\nis now underpriced compared to what it could be. In the aggregate,\nthe company actually underpriced itself in this scenario.\nwww.itdf.ir\n110 Venture Deals\n There’s also some dissonance here since VCs spend a lot of their\ntime valuing companies and negotiating on price. If your VC can’t or\nwon’t do this, what is this telling you? Do you and the VC have radically different views of the value proposition you’ve created? Will this\nimpact the relationship going forward or the way that each of you\nstrategically thinks about your company?\nthe Discount\n Remember that a convertible debt deal doesn’t purchase equity in\nyour company. Instead, it’s simply a loan that has the ability to convert to equity based on some future fi nancing event. Let’s begin our\ndiscussion of terms for convertible debt with the most important\none, the discount .\n Until recently, we had never seen a convertible debt deal that\ndidn’t convert at a discount to the next fi nancing round. Given some\nof the current excited market conditions at the seed stage, we’ve\nheard of convertible deals with no discount but view this as irregular\nand not sustainable over the long term.\n The idea behind the discount is that investors should get, or\nrequire, more upside than just the interest rate associated with\nthe debt for the risk that they are taking by investing early. These\ninvestors aren’t banks—they are planning to own equity in the\ncompany, but are simply deferring the price discussion to the next\nfi nancing.\n So how does the discount work? There are two approaches: the\ndiscounted price to the next round and warrants. We’ll cover the\ndiscounted price approach in this section, as it’s much simpler and\nbetter oriented for a seed round investment.\n For the discounted price to the next round, you might see something like this in the legal documents:\nthe entrepreneur’s perspective\n To attract seed-stage investors, consider a convertible debt deal with two additional features: a reasonable time horizon on an equity \u001f nancing and a forced\nconversion if that horizon isn’t met, as well as a \u001e oor, not a ceiling, on the conversion valuation.\nwww.itdf.ir\nConvertible Debt 111\nThis Note shall automatically convert in whole without any\nfurther action by the Holders into such Equity Securities at a\nconversion price equal to eighty percent (80%) of the price per\nshare paid by the Investors purchasing the Equity Securities on\nthe same terms and conditions as given to the Investors.\nThis means that if your next round investors are paying $1 per\nshare, then the note will convert into the same shares at a 20%\ndiscount, or $0.80 per share. For example, if you have a $100,000\nconvertible note, it will purchase 125,000 shares ($100,000/$0.80)\nwhereas the new equity investor will get 100,000 shares for his investment of $100,000 ($100,000/$1).\nThe range of discounts we typically see is 10 to 30%, with 20%\nbeing the most common. While occasionally you’ll see a discount\nthat increases over time (e.g., 10% if the round closes in 90 days,\n20% if it takes longer), we generally recommend entrepreneurs\n(and investors) keep this simple—it is the seed round, after all.\nValuation Caps\nThe next economic term is the valuation cap, also known as the cap.\nThe cap is an investor-favorable term that puts a ceiling on the conversion price of the debt. The valuation cap is typically seen in seed\nrounds where the investors are concerned that the next round of\nfinancing will be at a price that is at a valuation that wouldn’t reward\nthem appropriately for taking a risk by investing early in the seed\nround.\nFor example, an investor wants to invest $100,000 in a company\nand thinks that the pre-money valuation of the company is somewhere in the $2 million to $4 million range. The entrepreneur\nthinks the valuation should be higher. Either way, the investor and\nthe entrepreneur agree to not deal with a valuation negotiation and\ninstead decide to consummate a convertible debt deal with a 20%\ndiscount to the next round.\nNine months pass and the company is doing well. The entrepreneur is happy and the investor is happy. The company goes to raise a\nround of financing in the form of preferred stock. It receives a term\nsheet at a $20 million pre-money valuation. In this case, the discount\nof 20% would result in the investor having an effective valuation of\n$16 million for his investment nine months ago.\nwww.itdf.ir\n112 Venture Deals\nOn one hand, the investor is happy for the entrepreneur; but on\nthe other hand, he is shocked by the relatively high valuation for his\ninvestment. He realizes he made a bad decision by not pricing the\ndeal initially, as anything below $16 million would have been better\nfor him. Of course, this is nowhere near the $2 million to $4 million\nthe investor was contemplating the company was worth at the time\nhe made the convertible debt investment.\nThe valuation cap addresses this situation. By agreeing on a cap,\nthe entrepreneur and the investor can still defer the price discussion\nbut set a ceiling at which point the conversion price caps.\nIn our previous example, let’s assume that the entrepreneur and\nthe investor agree on a $4 million cap. Since the deal has a 20%\ndiscount, any valuation up to $5 million will result in the investor\ngetting a discount of 20%. Once the discounted value goes above\nthe cap, then the cap will apply. So, in the case of the $20 million\npre-money valuation, the investor will get shares at an effective price\nof $4 million.\nAs we’ve mentioned, in some cases, caps can impact the valuation of the next round. Some VCs will look at the cap and view it as\na price ceiling to the next round price, assuming that it was the high\npoint negotiated between the seed investors and the entrepreneur.\nTo mitigate this, entrepreneurs should try not to disclose the seed\nround terms until a price has been agreed to with a new VC investor.\nLately, we’ve been seeing a lot of VCs ask for the terms of the convertible debt round before they are willing to issue a term sheet. We\nunderstand that it is hard for an entrepreneur to say no to a potential funding partner’s requests.\nClearly, entrepreneurs would prefer not to have valuation caps.\nHowever, many seed investors recognize that an uncapped note has\nthe potential to create a big risk/return disparity, especially in frothy\nmarkets for early-stage deals. We believe that—over the long term—\ncaps create more alignment between entrepreneurs and seed investors as long as the price cap is thoughtfully negotiated based on the\nstage of the company.\nInterest ate\nSince convertible debt is a loan, it almost always has an interest rate\nassociated with it, as that’s the minimum upside an investor is going\nto want to have for the investment.\nwww.itdf.ir\nConvertible Debt 113\nWe believe interest rates on convertible debt should be as low\nas possible. This isn’t bank debt, and the investors are being fairly\ncompensated through the use of whatever type of discount has been\nnegotiated. If you are an entrepreneur, check out what the applicable federal rates (AFRs) are to see the lowest legally allowable interest\nrates; bump them up just a little bit (for volatility), and suggest whatever that number is.\nRealizing that the discount and the interest rate are often\nlinked, we’ll usually see an interest rate between 4% and 12% (the\nmedian is 8%) associated with a discount between 10% and 30%\n(the median is 20%).\nConversion Mechanics\nEventually the convertible debt will convert into equity. There are\nseveral nuances around how and when the note will convert. These\nconversion mechanics are important but can usually be configured in a\nway where everyone will be happy with them if they concentrate on\ndefining them up front.\nIn general, debt holders have traditionally enjoyed superior\ncontrol rights over companies and the ability to force nasty things\nlike bankruptcy and involuntary liquidations. Therefore, having outstanding debt (that doesn’t convert) can be a bad thing\nif an entrepreneur ever gets sideways with one of the debt holders. While it’s not talked about that much, it happens, and we’ve\nseen situations where the debt holder has excessive power in a\nnegotiation.\nHere is typical conversion language:\nIn the event that Payor issues and sells shares of its Equity Securities to investors (the “Investors”) on or before [180] days from\nthe date herewith (the “Maturity Date”) in an equity financing with total proceeds to the Payor of not less than $1 million\n(excluding the conversion of the Notes or other debt) (a “Qualified Financing”), then the outstanding principal balance of this\nNote shall automatically convert in whole without any further\naction by the Holders into such Equity Securities at a conversion\nprice equal to the price per share paid by the Investors purchasing the Equity Securities on the same terms and conditions as\ngiven to the Investors.\nwww.itdf.ir\n114 Venture Deals\nLet’s take a look at what matters in this paragraph. Notice that\nin order for the note to convert automatically, all of the conditions\nmust be met. If not, there is no automatic conversion.\n● Term. Here, the company must sell equity within six months\n(180 days) for the debt to automatically convert. Consider\nwhether this is enough time. If we were entrepreneurs, we’d\ntry to get this period to be as long as possible. Many venture\nfirms are not allowed (by their agreements with their investors) to issue debt that has a maturity date longer than a year,\nso don’t be surprised if one year is the maximum that you can\nnegotiate if you are dealing with a VC investor.\n● Amount. In this case the company must raise $1,000,000 of new\nmoney for the debt to convert because the conversion of the\noutstanding debt is excluded. The entrepreneur often gets\nto decide the amount based on the minimum the company\nis hoping to raise. When you determine this number, think\nabout how long you have (180 days in this example) and how\nmuch you think you can reasonably raise in that time period.\nSo what happens if the company does not achieve the milestones\nto automatically convert the debt? The debt stays outstanding unless\nthe debt holders agree to convert their holdings. This is when voting control comes into play. It is important to pay attention to the\namendment provision in the notes.\nAny term of this Note may be amended or waived with the written consent of Payor and the Majority Holders. Upon the effectuation of such waiver or amendment in conformance with this\nSection 11, the Payor shall promptly give written notice thereof\nto the record Holders of the Notes who have not previously consented thereto in writing.\nWhile one will never see anything less than a majority of holders\nneeding to consent to an amendment (and thus a different standard\nfor conversion), make sure the standard doesn’t get too high. For\ninstance, if you had two parties splitting $1 million in convertible\ndebt with a 60/40 percentage split, you only need one party to consent if the majority rules, but both parties would need to consent if\na supermajority must approve. Little things like this can make a big\nwww.itdf.ir\nConvertible Debt 115\ndifference if the 40% holder is the one you aren’t getting along with\nat the present moment.\nConversion in a Sale of the Company\nWhat happens to the convertible debt if the company gets acquired\nbefore there is an equity financing and before the debt is converted\nto equity? There are a few different scenarios.\nThe investor gets its money back plus interest. If there is no specific\nlanguage addressing this situation, this is what usually ends up happening. In this case, the convertible debt document doesn’t allow\nthe debt to convert into anything, but at the same time mandates\nthat upon a sale the debt must be paid off. So the investors don’t see\nany of the upside on the acquisition. The potentially bad news is that\nif the merger is an all-stock deal, the company will need to find a way\nto find cash to pay back the loan or negotiate a way for the acquiring\ncompany to deal with the debt.\nThe investor gets its money back, plus interest plus a multiple of the original principal amount. In this case, the documents dictate that the\ncompany will pay back outstanding principal plus interest and then\na multiple on the original investment. Usually we see a multiple of\ntwo to three times, but in later-stage companies this multiple can be\neven higher. Typical language follows:\nSale of the Company: If a Qualified Financing has not occurred\nand the Company elects to consummate a sale of the Company\nprior to the Maturity Date, then notwithstanding any provision\nof the Notes to the contrary (i) the Company will give the Investors at least five days prior written notice of the anticipated closing date of such sale of the Company and (ii) the Company will\npay the holder of each Note an aggregate amount equal to ___\ntimes the aggregate amount of principal and interest then outstanding under such Note in full satisfaction of the Company’s\nobligations under such Note.\nSome sort of conversion does occur. In the case of an early-stage company that hasn’t issued preferred stock yet, the debt converts into\nstock of the acquiring company (if it’s a stock deal) at a valuation\nsubject to a cap. If it’s not a stock deal, then one normally sees one\nof the preceding scenarios.\nwww.itdf.ir\n116 Venture Deals\nWith later-stage companies, the investors usually structure the\nconvertible notes to have the most flexibility. They either get a multiple payout on the debt or get the equity upside based on the previous preferred round price. Note that if the acquisition price is\nlow, the holders of the debt may usually opt out of conversion and\ndemand cash payment on the notes.\nWhile in many cases issuing convertible debt is easier to deal\nwith than issuing equity, the one situation where this often becomes\ncomplex is an acquisition while the debt is outstanding. Our strong\nadvice is to address in the documents how the debt will be handled\nin an acquisition.\nWarrants\nA few sections ago we discussed the “discounted price to the next\nround” approach to providing a discount on convertible debt. The\nother approach to a discount is to issue warrants. This approach\nis more complex and usually applies only to situations where the\ncompany has already raised a round of equity, but it occasionally\npops up in early-stage deals. If you are doing a seed round, we\nencourage you not to use this approach and instead save some\nlegal fees. However, if you are doing a later-stage convertible debt\nround or your investors insist on you issuing warrants, here’s how\nit works.\nAssume that once again the investor is investing $100,000 and\nreceives warrant coverage in the amount of 20% of the amount of\nthe convertible note. In this case the investor will get a warrant for\n$20,000.\nThis is where it can get a little tricky. What does $20,000 worth of\nwarrants mean? A warrant is an option to purchase a certain number\nof shares at a predetermined price. But how do you figure out the\nnumber of warrants and the price that the warrants will be at? There\nare numerous different ways to calculate this, such as:\n● $20,000 worth of common stock at the last value ascribed to\neither the common or the preferred stock.\n● $20,000 worth of the last round of preferred stock at that\nround’s price of the stock.\n● $20,000 worth of the next round of preferred stock at whatever price that happens to be.\nwww.itdf.ir\nConvertible Debt 117\nAs you can see, the actual percentage of the company associated\nwith the warrants can vary greatly depending on the price of the\nsecurity that underlies it. As a bonus, the particular ownership of\ncertain classes may affect voting control of a particular class of stock.\nIf there is a standard, it’s the second version, where the warrants are attached to the prior preferred stock round. If there is\nno prior preferred, then one normally sees the stock convert to the\nnext preferred round unless an acquisition of the company occurs\nbefore a preferred round is consummated; in that case, it reverts to\nthe common stock.\nFor example, assume that the round gets done at $1 per share\nas in the previous example. The investor who holds a $100,000 convertible note will get $20,000 of warrants, or 20,000 warrants at an\nexercise price of $1, to go along with the 100,000 shares received in\nthe financing from the conversion of the note.\nWarrants have a few extra terms that matter.\n● Term length. The length of time the warrants are exercisable,\nwhich is typically 5 to 10 years. Shorter is better for the entrepreneur and company. Longer is better for the investor.\n● Merger considerations. What happens to the warrants in the event\nthe company is acquired? We can’t opine more strongly that\nall warrants should expire at a merger unless they are exercised just prior to the transaction. In other words, the warrant\nholder must decide to either exercise or give up the warrants\nif the company is acquired. Acquiring companies hate buying\ncompanies that have warrants that survive a merger and allow\nthe warrant holder to buy equity in the acquirer. Many mergers have been held up because warrants with this feature have\nupset the potential acquirer and thus as part of the closing\nrequirements the acquirer has mandated that the company\ngo out and repurchase or edit the terms of the warrants. This\nis not a good negotiating spot for the company to find itself\nin, as it will have to pay off warrant holders while disclosing\nthe potential merger (so the company will have little leverage)\nand at the same time will have a sword hanging over its head\nby the acquirer until the issue is resolved.\n● Original issue discount (OID). This is an accounting issue that\nis boring, yet important. If a convertible debt deal includes\nwarrants, the warrants must be paid for separately in order to\nwww.itdf.ir\n118 Venture Deals\navoid the OID issue. In other words, if the debt is for $100,000\nand there is 20% warrant coverage, the Internal Revenue\nService (IRS) says that the warrants themselves have some\nvalue. If there is no provision for the actual purchase of the\nwarrants, the investor will have received an original issue discount, which says that the $100,000 debt was issued at a discount since the investor also received warrants. The problem\nis that part of the $100,000 principal repaid will be included\nas interest to the investor or, even worse, it will be accrued as\nincome over the life of the note even before any payments are\nmade. The easy fix is to pay something for the warrants, which\nusually is an amount in the low thousands of dollars.\nThe difference between warrants and a discount is probably\ninsignificant for the investor. We suppose if the investor is able to\nget warrants for common stock, then perhaps the ultimate value of\nwarrants may outweigh the discount, but it’s not clear. As evidenced\nby the number of words we have devoted to the topic, warrants add\na fair amount of complexity and legal costs to the mix. However,\nsome discounts will include valuation caps, and that can create some\nnegative company valuation ramifications while warrants completely\nstay away from the valuation discussion. Warrants are not nearly as\npopular as they once were as discounts are more typically used.\nFinally, in no case should an entrepreneur let an investor double\ndip and receive both a discount and warrants. That’s not a reasonable position for investors to take—they should either get a discount\nor get warrants.\nOther erms\nThere are a few other terms that can show up in a convertible debt\ndeal. You’ll recognize these from the earlier chapters on terms in\nan equity financing, as they are the terms that more sophisticated\nangels or seed investors will insist on to preserve their rights in later\nfinancings.\nThe first term you’ll occasionally see in a convertible debt financing is a pro rata right, which will allow debt holders to participate proratably in a future financing. Since the dollars invested in a convertible debt deal are often small, investors may ask for super pro rata\nrights. For instance, if an investor invests $500,000 in a convertible\nwww.itdf.ir\nConvertible Debt 119\ndebt deal and the company later raises $7 million, the investor’s pro\nrata investment rights wouldn’t allow the investor to purchase a large\nportion of the next round. As a result, the seed investor may ask for a\npro rata right for two to four times the investor’s current ownership\nor for a specific percentage (say 5% to 20%) of the next financing.\nWhile pro rata rights are pretty typical, if you have people asking for\nsuper pro rata rights or a specific portion of the next financing, you\nshould be careful, as granting these will limit your long-term financing options.\nEvery now and then you’ll see a liquidation preference in a convertible debt deal. It works the same way as in a preferred stock\ndeal: the investors get their money back first, or a multiple of their\nmoney back first, before any proceeds are distributed to anyone\nelse. This usually happens in the case when a company is struggling\nto raise capital and current investors offer a convertible debt (also\ncalled a bridge loan) deal to the company. Back in the good old\ndays, usury laws prevented such terms, but in most states this is not\nan issue and the investors are allowed to have not only the security\nof holding debt, but the upside of preferred stock should a liquidation event occur.\narly-Stage versus Late-Stage Dynamics\nTraditionally, convertible debt was issued by mid- to late-stage startups that needed a financing to get them to a place where they\nbelieved they could raise more money. Thus, these deals were called\nbridge financings.\nThe terms were basically the same unless the company was performing poorly and there was doubt about the ability to raise new\ncapital, or the bridge was to get the company to an acquisition or\nan orderly shutdown. In these cases, one saw terms like liquidation\npreferences and in some cases changes to board or voting control\ncome into play. Some of these bridge loans also contained terms like\npay-to-play, which we discussed in Chapter 4.\nGiven the traditional complexity and cost of legal fees associated\nwith preferred stock financings, however, convertible debt became\na common way to make seed-stage investments, as it tended to be\nsimpler and less expensive from a legal perspective. Over time,\nequity rounds have become cheaper to consummate, and the legal\nfees argument doesn’t carry much weight these days. In the end, the\nwww.itdf.ir\n120 Venture Deals\nmain force driving the use of convertible debt in early-stage companies is the parties’ desire to avoid setting a valuation.\nCan Convertible Debt Be Dangerous?\nOne final issue with convertible debt is a technical legal one. You’ll\nhave to forgive us, but Jason is an ex-lawyer and sometimes we can’t\nkeep him in his cage.\nIf a company raises cash via equity, it has a positive balance sheet.\nIt is solvent (assets are greater than obligations), and the board and\nexecutives have fiduciary duties to the shareholders in the efforts\nto maximize company value. The shareholders are all the usual suspects: the employees and VCs. Life is good and normal.\nHowever, if a company is insolvent, the board and company may\n(based in large part on state law—ask your attorney) now owe fiduciary duties to the creditors of the company. By definition, if you\nraise a convertible debt round, your company is insolvent. You have\ncash, but your debt obligations are greater than your assets. Your\ncreditors include your landlord, anyone you owe money to (including former disgruntled employees), and founders who have lawyers.\nHow does this change the paradigm? To be fair, we have had no\npersonal war stories here, but it’s not hard to construct some weird\nsituations.\nLet’s look at the hypothetical situation.\nAssume the company is not a success and fails. In the case of\nraising equity, the officers and directors owe a duty only to the creditors (e.g., the landlord) at such time that cash isn’t large enough to\npay their liabilities. If the company manages it correctly, creditors\nare paid off cleanly even on the downside scenario. But sometimes\nit doesn’t happen this way and there are lawsuits. When the lawyers\nget involved, they’ll look to establish the time in which the company\nwent insolvent and then try to show that the actions of the board\nwere bad during that time. If the time frame is short, it’s hard to\nmake a case against the company.\nHowever, if you raise debt, the insolvency time lasts until your\ndebt converts into equity. As a result, if your company ends up failing and you can’t pay your creditors, the ability for a plaintiff lawyer\nto judge your actions has increased dramatically. And don’t forget:\nif you have any outstanding employment litigation, all of these folks\ncount as creditors as well.\nwww.itdf.ir\nConvertible Debt 121\nThe worst part of this is that many states impose personal liability\non directors for things that occur while a company is insolvent. This\nmeans that some states will allow creditors to sue directors personally\nfor not getting all of the money they are owed.\nNow, we don’t want to get too crazy here. We are talking about\nearly-stage and seed companies, and hopefully the situation is clean\nenough that these doomsday predictions won’t happen, but our bet\nis that few folks participating in convertible debt rounds are actually\nthinking about these issues. While we don’t know of any actual cases\nout there, we’ve been around this business long enough to know that\nthere is constant innovation in the plaintiff’s bar as well.\nn lternative to Convertible Debt\nOver the years, in addition to efforts to standardize early-stage financing documents, there have been several attempts to create a synthetic\nearly-stage financing instrument that combines the best characteristics of equity and debt. The most recent, and most popular instrument was created several years ago by Y Combinator and is called the\nsafe (Simple Agreement for Future Equity). It was followed quickly\nby 500 Startups’ version called KISS (Keep It Simple Security), demonstrating once again that document standardization is not a reality\nin the world of startups, at least as long as lawyers are involved.\nThe idea of the safe (yes, the phrasing “the safe” is deliberate, as\nit’s intended to be analogous to “the note,” which is how convertible\nnotes are often referred to) is that the investor buys what effectively\nis an unpriced warrant in the company, as opposed to buying convertible debt. This eliminates some of the concerns around using\ndebt, including the edge case issues around legal dynamics of debt,\nand eliminates some features of debt such as interest.\nAs with convertible debt, the safe can have a cap and/or a discount. An MFN, or most favored nation clause, can also be included so\nthat if better terms are given to future investors, they are automatically inherited by the safe investors.\nFor investors, the safe has several disadvantages over convertible\nnotes, such as the lack of an explicit pro-rata right in the following\nround. As with convertible notes, this can be added, but at some\nlevel this undermines the idea of a simple, standard document.\nThe lack of maturity date is both an advantage and a disadvantage. While it eliminates the risk for the entrepreneur associated with\nwww.itdf.ir\n122 Venture Deals\na maturity date with debt, it simultaneously eliminates the requirement for the entrepreneurs to communicate with the investors at\nleast around the timing of the maturity date. In many convertible\ndebt situations, investors will simply extend the maturity date. However, in some situations, especially ones where companies are struggling and the entrepreneurs are not communicating with the investors, the lack of a maturity date takes away a key leverage point—at\nleast for a discussion—from the investors.\nAs with convertible debt, the safe punts on many of the key issues\n(the most important of these being valuation) that are addressed\nwith an equity round enabling both founders and investors to defer,\nor be lazy about, issues until the next financing round.\nwww.itdf.ir\n123\n9\nC h a p t e r\nCrowdfunding \nWhen we wrote the first version of this book in 2011, the idea of\nusing crowdfunding as a financing mechanism was nascent. Since\nthen, it has emerged as a powerful approach, both for product\ndevelopment and equity financing. In this chapter we will discuss\nthe various crowdfunding approaches and legal implications, and\nhow crowdfunding differs from more traditional methods.\nroduct Crowdfunding\nCrowdfunding typically refers to two different approaches that are\nrelevant to financing companies. The first, popularized by Kickstarter and Indiegogo, is product crowdfunding.\nProduct crowdfunding is typically used for physical products. The\ncompany puts its product idea up on Kickstarter along with content\nshowing what the product will do and a series of different rewards\nfor backers. In most cases, the product is in an early design stage and\nfar from ready to ship. The rewards vary by dollar amount and often\ninclude things that, while linked to the product, are experiential or\ntangential to the product, such as logoed stickers and T-shirts, sponsorship recognition, or real-world events to celebrate the launch of\nthe product.\nMost campaigns have a 30-day funding target that, if not achieved,\nresults in the campaign failing and funding not occurring. This is\nthe hardware equivalent of building a software minimum-viable product\n(MVP). If the campaign is successful, you know you have a compelling\nVenture Deals: Be Smarter than Your Lawyer\nand Venture Capitalist, Third Edition\nBy Brad Feld and Jason Mendelson\nCopyright © 2016 by Brad Feld and Jason Mendelson\nwww.itdf.ir\n124 Venture Deals\nMVP. If the campaign does not reach its funding target, your potential customers are telling you that your MVP is not interesting enough\nto pursue.\nSeveral high profile products got their start on Kickstarter,\nincluding the Pebble Watch (which raised $10.2 million in 30 days)\nand Oculus Rift (which raised $2.5 million in 30 days). Companies\nhave also had similar successes on Indiegogo, such as TrackR, which\nraised $1.7 million.\nIf this sounds similar to a preorder campaign, it is, and you will\nalso hear people refer to them as “presales” or “preorders.” While\nKickstarter, Indiegogo, and other crowdfunding sites are growing\nrapidly, some companies, such as Glowforge, have decided to run\ntheir own preorder campaigns. In Glowforge’s case, they raised\n$27.9 million in 30 days, demonstrating that if you have a compelling product and are sophisticated around marketing and promoting\nyour product, you can run a very successful preorder campaign on\nyour own.\nThe crowdfunding approach can even be rolled into your business model. When we invested in Betabrand, they were building\na two-sided clothing marketplace that incorporated the notion of\ncrowdfunding into their design process. Individual designers can\ncreate new designs that are then promoted on Betabrand’s website.\nCustomers preorder the designs and if a certain preorder threshold\nis met, the design is produced and becomes a permanent product in\nBetabrand’s catalog.\nIn each of these cases, one of the large advantages of this\napproach is that the funding is nondilutive as no equity is involved.\nInstead of selling equity or debt, you are preselling a product and\ncollecting the cash up front.\nThe downside of product crowdfunding is the situation where a\ncampaign is successful but the company doesn’t finish building the\nproduct. In some cases, the company is able to raise addition capital,\noften equity, to complete the product and fulfill the preorders. In\nothers, the company never ships the product or only fulfills some\naspect of the campaign. While this situation is disappointing, the\nculture around product crowdfunding is such that these failures\nare understood to be part of the process, in the same way that investing equity in a company does not necessarily result in a successful\ncompany and a return on the investment.\nwww.itdf.ir\nCrowdfunding  125\nquity Crowdfunding\nThe second crowdfunding approach, popularized by AngelList, is\nequity crowdfunding. This approach pertains to the situation when\nan investor gives money to a company in exchange for a security\n(either debt or equity) through an intermediated process, often\ninvolving an online funding platform. These platforms, such as\nAngelList, allow companies to essentially advertise their funding or\nuse the power of a social network to attract other investor interest.\nEvolved approaches, such as AngelList Syndicates, allow individual\ninvestors to aggregate other investors to participate in their syndicate,\nacting like a small version of a venture capital fund.\nWhile crowdfunding has expanded to cover many different situations, there are tight legal definitions surrounding each approach\nthat were defined as part of the JOBS Act (the full name is the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act) that was passed in 2012. As a result,\nsome of the aspects of fundraising on platforms like AngelList are\nreferred to as crowdfunding, but are really not anything new, other\nthan the use of an online platform to connect companies with potential investors.\nIn the United States, if you are selling a security, you need to\nregister the security with the Securities and Exchange Commission\n(SEC) unless you have an exemption not to. A security is any financial instrument that gives you an ownership interest in a company,\nincluding common stock, preferred stock, or convertible debt. This\ndoesn’t include revenue derived from product crowdfunding or a\npreorder campaign. The original rules for registering securities were\ndefined in the Securities Act of 1933, and, while they have evolved,\nare still based on rules negotiated more than 80 years ago.\nFortunately, there are a number of exemptions that allow you\nto avoid an SEC registration. In general, unless you are taking a\ncompany public via initial public offering (IPO), you won’t have to\nworry about registering your offering with the SEC. However, there\nare important guidelines that you must follow in order not to blow\nup your ability to rely on an exemption. The two most important to\nunderstand are the concept of an accredited investor and the process\nof general solicitation.\nAn accredited investor is a person who has a substantial net worth\nor income, as defined by the SEC and changed from time to time.\nIn most cases, entities such as a VC, a corporation with meaningful\nwww.itdf.ir\n126 Venture Deals\nassets, or a registered bank automatically qualify. An individual qualifies if she earns $200,000 per year or has a joint income with her spouse\nof $300,000 and this level has been earned in the previous two years\nand can be reasonably expected to be earned in the future. If an individual doesn’t have this level of income, she can qualify if she has a net\nworth exceeding $1 million either alone or jointly with her spouse.\nUnlike an accredited investor, the SEC does not clearly define\nwhat is considered to be general solicitation, instead leaving it open\nto interpretation. Historically, general solicitation referred to advertising or publicly promoting your fundraising, such as specifically\nmaking a financing ask in public at an accelerator demo day. Depending on your lawyer and how conservative you are, the line of where\ngeneral solicitation is crossed is vague, but the simple test is that if\nyou don’t have a preexisting relationship with someone and encounter them through something that looks like an advertisement (which\ncould include a mass email, rather than a one-on-one introduction),\nthen you are likely in the general solicitation bucket.\nPrior to the JOBS Act, one wanted to avoid raising money from\ninvestors who were not accredited as well as avoid general solicitation.\nWith the JOBS Act, the rules changed somewhat.\nWhile there are an endless number of $99 courses on how to\nraise money for your company using crowdfunding, our friend Brad\nBernthal, a law professor at CU Boulder, created the following chart\nas a summary of the implications of the three major crowdfunding\nand financing aspects of the JOBS Act. These are known as Rule\n506(b), Rule 506(c)/Title II, and Title III.\nRule 506(b) Rule 506(c)/Title II Title III\nAggregate cap on\namount raised?\nNo No Yes ($1 million over 12 months)\nGeneral solicitation\nallowed?\nNo Yes No, except via a single funding\nportal or broker\nWho can invest? Accredited Accredited Accredited and nonaccredited\nBroker or intermediary\nrequired?\nNo No Yes\nRegulatory burden Light Medium Heavy\nPrior to Title II of the JOBS Act, if you generally solicited, you\nhad broken the law and could not raise money. Prior to Title III of\nwww.itdf.ir\nCrowdfunding  127\nthe JOBS Act, it was next to impossible to raise a meaningful amount\nof money from nonaccredited investors.\nFrom a legal perspective, equity crowdfunding is really only\nTitle III, where nonaccredited investors can participate. Not surprisingly, this is also the most heavily regulated approach. A company is\nlimited to raising $1 million over a 12-month period and it can only\nsolicit through one online funding portal or with a broker. While\nnonaccredited investors can participate in a Title III financing, there\nare limits on the size of individual investments, which, depending on\nthe investor’s net worth, can be as little at $2,000. Finally, there is a\nsignificant burden of SEC-mandated information disclosures that can\neasily cost a company tens of thousands of dollars to comply with.\nEven though the phrase crowdfunding gets regularly applied\nto financings done on AngelList and other online platforms, this is\noften more around marketing the platform than it is around the substance of investing. Most of the financings done on AngelList happen\nunder the 506(b) rules, which is similar to how most VC financings\nhave historically been done. In some cases, companies use 506(c) so\nthey can advertise more widely on a site like AngelList, but still only\naccept accredited investors. In these situations, there are additional\nregulations to ensure their investors are, indeed, accredited.\now quity Crowdfunding Differs\nA difference between equity crowdfunding and a more traditional\nfinancing is that with crowdfunding you are often setting the terms\nof the deal. Most sites allow you to determine the form of security\nyou are issuing (equity versus debt) and to set all the major terms.\nWhile this is occasionally negotiated with a lead investor, in our experience most companies do not see much pushback on the terms they\npropose as long as they are reasonable.\nWhile convertible debt financings are generally straightforward,\nthey typically include a specific cap. With equity financings, a very\nlight preferred stock with minimal protective provisions and terms\nare often used. Board seats, at least as part of the crowdfunding\nactivity, are rarely offered.\nThe materials you put together include a traditional executive\nsummary and a PowerPoint presentation. When raising online,\nyou often get opportunities to spice things up with a fancy video,\nwww.itdf.ir\n128 Venture Deals\nspecific data about your recent performance, and continuous\nrefreshes on this background information as time passes during\nthe financing process.\nIn a VC-backed fundraise, you are often getting one or more\nself-proclaimed experts (the VC) involved in your company in an\nactively engaged way, either as a mentor, coach, networker, or board\nmember. In crowdfunding situations, you are getting a crowd. While\nyou may have a lead investor, you will now have many small investors\nwho may, or may not, be focused on helping your company. Their\ninvestment may be a tiny dollar amount for them and they may have\nmany separate small investments. Consequently, the responsibility\non communication and engagement will be on you as it’s unlikely\nthat many of your new investors will proactively reach out to help.\nWhile this is similar to a situation where you raise money traditionally from a bunch of individual angels, it’s a common dynamic in\ncrowdfunding deals.\nWe’ve observed some companies end up being stranded after a\ncrowdfunding round. These companies either can’t, or don’t, raise\nenough money in the crowdfunding round and find themselves\nwithout money and with a noncommitted investor syndicate. Often,\nthese companies are not mature enough to attract a VC financing\nand end up in a situation where they are too early for VCs, yet don’t\nhave meaningful support from their existing crowd of investors.\nFinally, watch out for the jerks. We’ve seen situations where\none or more members of a crowdfunded financing feel overly selfimportant, construct belief systems around the company that are\ndelusional, or simply regret investing and try to exert pressure on\nthe founders in inappropriate ways. While some angel investors forget that they are supposed to be “angels” instead of “devils,” some\ncrowdfunding participants don’t appear to have subscribed to the\nangel notion to begin with. While some of this results from lack of\nsophistication of some investors in crowdfunding deals, there often\nis less concern about reputational constraints given the dynamics of\ncrowdfunding as compared to angel or VC investing. A final challenge with crowdfunding platforms is that it’s more difficult for the\nentrepreneur to do detailed diligence on the crowd, so beware of\nthe squeaky wheel who can be a real pain in the neck.\nwww.itdf.ir\n129\n10C h a p t e r\now Venture Capital Funds Work\nBefore we talk about the dynamics of negotiating the deal, it’s\nuseful to understand the motivation of the person you’ll be negotiating against, namely, the venture capitalist (VC). We’ve been asked\nmany times to divulge the deep, dark secrets of what makes VCs tick.\nOne night over dinner we talked through much of this with a very\nexperienced entrepreneur who was in the middle of a negotiation\nfor a late stage round for his company. At the end of the discussion, he implored us to put pen to paper since even though he was\nextremely experienced and had been involved in several VC-backed\ncompanies, our conversation helped him understand the nuances\nof what he was dealing with, which, until our explanation, had been\nconfusing him.\nIn general, it’s important to understand what drives your current\nand future business partners—namely, your VCs—as their motivations will impact your business. While the basics of how a venture\nfund works may be known, in this chapter we try to also cover all the\nnonobvious issues that play into how VCs think and behave. To do\nthat, we’ll dive into how funds are set up and managed as well as the\npressures (both internally and externally) that VCs face.\nOverview of a ypical Structure\nLet’s start by describing a typical VC fund structure (see illustration).\nThere are three basic entities that make up the fund. The first entity\nis the management company and is usually owned by the senior partners.\nThe management company employs all of the people with whom you\nVenture Deals: Be Smarter than Your Lawyer\nand Venture Capitalist, Third Edition\nBy Brad Feld and Jason Mendelson\nCopyright © 2016 by Brad Feld and Jason Mendelson\nwww.itdf.ir\n130 Venture Deals\ninteract at the firm, such as the partners, associates, and support staff,\nand pays for all of the normal day-to-day business expenses such as the\nfirm’s office lease, fresh fruit juicer, and monthly Internet expense.\nAs a result, the management company is essentially the franchise\nof the firm. While old funds are retired and new funds are raised,\nthe management company lives on and services each of the funds\nthat are raised. A VC’s business card almost always lists the name of\nthe management company, which is one of the reasons that the signature blocks on a term sheet often have a different name than the\none you are used to associating with the firm. For example, in our\ncase, Foundry Group is the name of our management company, not\nthat of the actual funds that we raise and invest from.\nThe next entity is the limited partnership (LP) vehicle. When a VC\ntalks about his “fund” or that his firm “raised a fund of $225 million,”\nhe is actually talking about a limited partnership vehicle that contains the investors in the fund (also called limited partners, or LPs).\nThe final entity is one an entrepreneur rarely hears of called the\ngeneral partnership (GP) entity. This is the legal entity for serving as\nthe actual general partner to the fund. In some partnerships, the\nindividual managing directors play this role, but over time this has\nevolved into a separate legal entity that the managing directors each\nown on a fund-by-fund basis.\nLP1 LP2 LP 3 LPn (Investors) (Investors)\nGeneral\nPartner II\nLLC “Fund II”\n“Fund I”\nGeneral\nPartner I\nLLC\nManagement Company\nFund\nI LP\nFund\nII LP\nLP... LP1 LP2 LP 3 LP...LPn\nManagement Company Structure: General artnership and Limited artnership\nwww.itdf.ir\now Venture Capital Funds Work 131\nWe realize this is confusing unless you are in law school, in which\ncase you are likely salivating with joy over the legal complexity we are\nexposing you to. The key point to remember is that there is separation between the management company (the franchise) and the\nactual funds that it raises (the LP entities). These distinct entities will\noften have divergent interests and motivations, especially as managing directors join or leave the venture capital firm. One managing\ndirector may be your point of contact today, but this person may\nhave different alignments among his multiple organizations that will\npotentially affect you.\now Firms aise Money\nThe next time you are on the fundraising trail beating your head\nagainst the wall trying to get through to a VC about how awesome\nyour business is, remember that VCs also get to enjoy the same process when raising funds. So, while we feel your pain, we also admit\nthat many VCs quickly forget about the whole process and inflict too\nmuch pain on the entrepreneurs raising money. While this knowledge might help a little when you are sitting frustrated in your hotel\nroom after another day of fundraising, we encourage you to also\ndiscover the magic soothing properties of scotch. (When Brad is\ndrinking, his current favorite is Lagavulin 16, while Jason has lately\nbeen enjoying Macallan 15.)\nVCs raise money from a variety of entities, including government\nand corporate pension funds, large corporations, banks, professional\ninstitutional investors, educational endowments, high-net-worth\nindividuals, funds of funds, charitable organizations, and insurance\ncompanies. The arrangement between the VCs and their investors\nis subject to a long, complicated contract known as the limited partnership agreement (LPA) that makes one thing clear: VCs have bosses\nalso—their investors, also known as their LPs.\nWhen a VC firm makes an announcement that it has raised a\n$100 million fund, it is not the case that the VC has $100 million\nsitting in the bank waiting for a smart entrepreneur to come along.\nThe venture capital firm normally keeps very little cash on hand and\nmust ask its LPs every time it wants money to make an investment.\nThis is known as a capital call and it typically takes two weeks from\nthe moment the money is requested until it arrives. Note that the\nLPs are legally obligated under the fund agreements to send the VCs\nmoney every time they make a capital call.\nwww.itdf.ir\n132 Venture Deals\nIf a venture capital firm requests money and its investors say no,\nthings get tricky. The VC usually has some very draconian rights in\nthe LPA to enforce its capital call, but we’ve seen several moments\nin history when VCs have done a capital call and there has been a\nsmaller amount of money to be had than anticipated. This is not\na good thing if you are the entrepreneur relying on getting a deal\ndone with the VC. Fortunately, this is a rare occurrence.\nWhy might investors refuse to fund a capital call? For one, LPs\nmay think the VC is making bad decisions and may want to get out\nof the fund. More likely, something exogenous has happened to the\nLPs and they are feeling tight on cash and can’t, or don’t want to,\ncomply with the capital call. This happened a number of times in the\nglobal economic crisis in the fall of 2008 (and even back in 2001)\nwhen three categories of LPs were impacted:\n1. High-net-worth individuals who were feeling lower-net-worth\nat the time;\n2. Banks that had no cash available (and quickly became parts\nof other banks); and\n3. Endowments, foundations, and charitable organizations that\nhad massive cash flow crises because of their ratio of illiquid\ninvestments.\nIn many cases, the VC will find a new LP to buy the old LP’s\ninterest. There is an active market known as a secondary market\nfor LPs who want to sell their interest. Economically, this is almost\nalways more attractive to the LP than not making a capital call, so\nexcept in moments of extreme stress, the VC usually ends up with\nthe money to make an investment.\now Venture Capitalists Make Money\nNow that we’ve explained the structure of a typical venture capital\nfund, let’s explore how VCs get paid. The compensation dynamics of\na particular fund often impacts the behavior of a VC early in the life\nof a company, as well as later on when the company is either succeeding or struggling and needs to raise additional capital.\nManagement Fees\nVCs’ salaries come from their funds’ management fees. The management fee is a percentage (typically between 1.5% and 2.5%) of the\nwww.itdf.ir\now Venture Capital Funds Work 133\ntotal amount of money committed to a fund. These fees are taken\nannually (paid out quarterly or semiannually) and finance the operations of the VC firm, including all of the salaries for the investing\npartners and their staff. For example, if a venture capital firm raises\na $100 million fund with a 2% management fee, each year the firm\nwill receive $2 million in management fees. While this may seem like\na lot of money, it goes to pay all of the costs of the venture capital\nfirm, including employees, partners, associates, rent, flying around\nthe country seeing entrepreneurs, copiers, diet soda, brand-new\nMacBook Airs, and a new iPhone every time Apple releases a new\nversion, even if it’s only a change in color.\nThe percentage is usually inversely related to the size of fund;\nthe smaller the fund, the larger the percentage—but most funds\nlevel out around 2%. There’s a slight nuance, which is the fee paid\nduring and after the commitment period, or the period of time when\nthe fund can make new investments—usually the first five years. This\nfee, which is usually 2% to 2.5%, begins to decrease after the end\nof the commitment period. The formula varies widely, but in most\nfirms the average total fee over a 10-year period is about 15% of the\ncommitted capital. So, in our previous $100 million fund example,\nthe typical fund will have $15 million of management fees to run its\noperations and pay its people.\nBut wait, there’s more. Most venture capital firms raise multiple\nfunds. The average firm raises a new fund every three or four years,\nbut some firms raise funds more frequently while others have multiple different fund vehicles such as an early-stage fund, a growth\nstage fund, and a China fund. In these cases, the fees stack up across\nfunds. If a firm raises a fund every three years, it has a new management fee that adds to its old management fee. The simple way to\nthink of this is that the management fee is roughly 2% of total committed capital across all funds. So, if Fund 1 is a $100 million fund\nand Fund 2 is a $200 million fund, the management fee ends up\nbeing approximately $6 million annually ($2 million for Fund 1 and\n$4 million for Fund 2).\nAlthough venture capital firms tend to grow head count (partners\nand staff) as they raise new funds, this isn’t always the case and the\nhead count rarely grows in direct proportion to the increased management fees. As a result, the senior partners of the venture capital\nfirm (or the ones with a managing director title) see their base compensation rise with each additional fund. The dynamics vary widely\nwww.itdf.ir\n134 Venture Deals\nfrom firm to firm, but you can assume that as the capital under management increases, so do the fees and, as a result, the salaries of some\nof the managing directors.\nThe venture capital firm gets this management fee completely\nindependently of its investing success. Over the long term, the only\nconsequence of investment success on the fee is the ability of the\nfirm to raise additional funds. If the firm does not generate meaningful positive returns, over time it will have difficulty raising additional funds. However, this isn’t an overnight phenomenon, as the\nfee arrangements for each fund are guaranteed for 10 years. We’ve\nbeen known to say that “it takes a decade to kill a venture capital\nfirm,” and the extended fee dynamic is a key part of this.\nCarried Interest\nEven though the management fees can be substantial, in a success\ncase the real money that a VC makes, known as the carried interest,\nor carry, should dwarf the management fee. Carry is the profit that\nVCs get after returning money to their investors (the LPs). If we use\nour $100 million fund example, VCs receive their carry after they’ve\nreturned $100 million to their LPs. Most VCs get 20% of the profits\nafter returning capital (a 20% carry), although some long-standing\nor extremely successful funds take up to 30% of the profits.\nLet’s play out our example. Again, start with the $100 million\nfund. Assume that it’s a successful fund and returns 3× the capital, or\n$300 million. In this case, the first $100 million goes back to the LPs,\nand the remaining profit, or $200 million, is split 80% to the LPs and\n20% to the GPs. The venture capital firm gets $40 million in carried\ninterest and the LPs get the remaining $160 million. And yes, in this\ncase everyone is very happy.\nRemember that this firm received about $15 million of management fees over a decade for this fund. However, there’s an interesting\nnuance here. If the fund is a $100 million fund and $15 million goes\nto management fees, doesn’t that leave only $85 million to invest? In\nsome cases it does, but VCs are allowed to recycle their management\nfee and subsequently reinvest it up to the total of $100 million. This\nassumes returns early enough in the life of the fund to recycle and\nin some cases careful cash flow management, but all firms should be\nmotivated to get the entire $100 million to work. In this case, the\n$15 million management fee can actually be viewed as a prepayment\nwww.itdf.ir\now Venture Capital Funds Work 135\non carry since it is essentially getting reinvested from proceeds from\nthe fund. All LPs should favor recycling, as their goal is generally\ncash-on-cash return. Getting more money to work, namely the full\n$100 million instead of only $85 million, enhances the total return.\nNote that we have been talking about the venture capital firm\nas a whole, not any individual managing director or other investment professional in the firm. An individual VC could quadruple\nthe amount of money invested in his particular companies, but still\nreceive no carry in a fund due to poor investment decisions made by\nthe other partners. In addition, most firms do not have equal allocation of carry between partners, with the senior partners tending to\nget disproportionately more than the younger partners. Over time\nthis can be a major source of friction within the firm if there is either\ninequitable behavior from the senior partners or other firms offer\nthe young star performers better economic incentives and pick them\noff. This gets especially difficult when a fund, or a series of funds, is\nperforming poorly yet the positive returns are coming from one or\ntwo partners.\nThose of you sophisticated in the art of fund structure will note\nthat we’ve neglected to point out that LPs want their VCs to invest in\ntheir own fund. Historically, there has been a 99%/1% split between\nthe LPs and the GPs, where the VC partners put in their own money\nalongside the LPs for 1% of the fund (e.g., in our $100 million fund\nexample, the LPs would put in $99 million and the GPs would put in\n$1 million). The GP commitment historically was 1% but has floated\nup over time and is occasionally as high as 5%.\nWhile carry sounds like a wonderful thing, there is one risky situation around it called the clawback. Again, assume our $100 million\nfund. Let’s also assume the VCs have called only half of the fund\n($50 million). If the $50 million invested so far returns $80 million,\nthe fund is in a profit situation where $50 million has been returned\nand there is $30 million in profit that the VCs have the right to take\ntheir carry on. The VCs happily pocket their $6 million, assuming\nthe carry is 20%. But what happens if the VCs call and invest the rest\nof the fund and it’s a bust, returning a total of only $100 million? At\nthe end of the fund, the VCs would have invested $100 million, but\nreturned only $100 million, and as a result should get no carry.\nSo what happens to the $6 million they took in the middle of the\nfund life? The $6 million is clawed back from the VCs and given back\nto the LPs. While logical in theory, it’s harder in practice. Assume the\nwww.itdf.ir\n136 Venture Deals\nventure capital fund has four equal partners who have each received\na $1.5 million carry check. These were happy days, followed by some\nnot so happy days when the fund performed poorly. Along the way,\ntwo of the VCs left the firm to go to other firms, and the remaining\ntwo partners no longer talk to them. In fact, one of the remaining\npartners got divorced and gave half of his money to his ex-spouse.\nAnd one of the other VCs declared bankruptcy after overextending himself financially. Oh, and all four of them have paid taxes on\ntheir carry.\nThe LPs don’t care. They want the $6 million that is owed to\nthem, and many fund agreements state that each partner is liable for\nthe full amount, regardless of what they actually received in profit\ndistributions. So, it’s possible that a subset of the partnership has to\npay back the LPs and fight with the current and former partners for\nthe rest. It’s not pretty and we wish this were only a hypothetical situation, but it’s not.\nReimbursement for Expenses\nThere is one other small income stream that VCs receive: reimbursements from the companies they invest in for expenses associated\nwith board meetings. VCs will charge all reasonable expenses associated with board meetings to the company they are visiting. This usually isn’t a big deal unless your VC always flies on his private plane\nand stays at the presidential suite at your local Four Seasons hotel. In\nthe case where you feel your VC is spending excessively and charging\neverything back to the company, you should feel comfortable confronting the VC. If you aren’t, enlist one of your more frugal board\nmembers to help.\now ime Impacts Fund ctivity\nVC fund agreements have two concepts that govern the ability to\ninvest over time. The first concept is called the commitment period.\nThe commitment period (also called “investment period”), which is\nusually five years, is the length of time that a VC has for identifying\nand investing in new companies in the fund. Once the commitment\nperiod is over, the fund can no longer invest in new companies, but\nit can invest additional money in existing portfolio companies. This\nis one of the main reasons that VC firms typically raise a new fund\nwww.itdf.ir\now Venture Capital Funds Work 137\nevery three to five years—once they’ve committed to all the companies they are going to invest in from a fund, they need to raise a new\nfund to stay active as investors in new companies.\nIt’s sad but true that some VCs who are past their commitment\nperiods and have not raised new funds still meet with entrepreneurs\ntrying to raise money. In these cases, the entrepreneur has no idea\nthat there is no chance the VCs will invest, but the VCs get to pretend\nthey are still actively investing and try to maintain some semblance of\ndeal flow even though they can’t invest any longer. We first saw this\nin 2006 and 2007 as firms that raised their previous funds in 2000 or\n2001 struggled to raise new funds. Over time the media picked up\non this dynamic and started referring to these firms as the “walking\ndead”—zombie-like VCs who were still acting like VCs, earning management fees from their old funds and actively managing their old\nportfolios, but not making new investments.\nThe good zombies are open about their status; the not-so-good\nones keep taking meetings with new companies even though they\ncan’t make new investments. It’s usually easy to spot a zombie VC—\njust ask them when they made their last new investment. If it’s more\nthan a year ago, it’s likely they are a zombie. You can also ask simple\nquestions like “How many new investments will you make out of your\ncurrent fund?” or “When do you expect to be raising a new fund?” If\nyou feel like the VC is giving you ambiguous answers, they are probably a zombie.\nThe other concept is called the investment term, or the length\nof time that the fund can remain active. New investments can be\nmade only during the commitment/investment period, but followon investments can be made during the investment term. A typical\nVC fund has a 10-year investment term with two one-year options to\nextend, although some have three one-year extensions or one twoyear extension. Twelve years may sound like plenty of time, but when\nan early-stage fund makes a new seed investment in its fifth year and\nthe time frame for exit for an average investment can stretch out\nover a decade, 12 years is often a constraint. As a result, many earlystage funds go on for longer than 12 years—occasionally up to as\nmany as 17 years (or even more).\nOnce you get past 12 years, the LPs have to affirmatively vote\nevery year to have the GP continue to operate the fund. In cases in\nwhich a firm has continued to raise additional funds, the LPs are\nwww.itdf.ir\n138 Venture Deals\ngenerally supportive of this continued fund extension activity. There\nis often a negotiation over the management fee being charged to\ncontinue to manage the fund, with it ranging from a lower percentage of remaining invested capital (say, 1%) all the way to waiving the\nfee entirely. This isn’t an issue for a fi rm that has raised additional\nfunds and has the management fee from those funds to cover its\noperations, but it is a major issue for zombie fi rms that fi nd their\nannual operating fees materially declining. Time is not the friend\nof a zombie fi rm, as partners begin to leave for greener pastures,\nspend less and less time helping the companies they’ve invested in,\nor simply start pushing the companies to sell and generate liquidity.\n In some cases, entire portfolios are sold to new fi rms via what\nis called a secondary sale in which someone else takes over managing the portfolio through the liquidation of the companies. In these\ncases, the people the entrepreneurs are dealing with, including their\nboard members, can change completely. These secondary buyers\noften have very different agendas than the original investor, usually\nmuch more focused on driving the company to a speedy exit, even at\na lower value than the other LPs.\nthe entrepreneur’s perspective\n One important thing to understand about your prospective investor’s fund is how\nold the fund is. The closer the fund is to its end of life, the more problematic\nthings can become for you in terms of investor pressure for liquidity (in which\nyour interests and the investor’s might not be aligned), or an investor requirement to distribute shares in your company to LPs, which could be horrible for\nyou if the \u001f rm has a large number of LPs who then become direct shareholders.\nreserves\nReserves are the amount of investment capital that is allocated to each\ncompany that a VC invests in. This is a very important concept that\nmost entrepreneurs don’t pay proper attention to. Imagine that a\nVC invests $1 million in the fi rst round of your company. When they\nmake the investment, the VC will reserve a theoretical future amount\nof the fund to invest in follow-on rounds. The VC generally won’t tell\nyou this amount, but it’s usually a well-defi ned amount within the\nventure capital fi rm.\nwww.itdf.ir\now Venture Capital Funds Work 139\nTypically, but not always, the earlier the stage a company is at,\nthe more reserves the VC will allocate. In the case of a late stage\ninvestment immediately prior to an initial public offering (IPO), a\nVC might not have any reserves allocated to a company, whereas a\nfirst-round investment might have reserves of $10 million or more\nassociated with it.\nWhile most VCs will ask the entrepreneur about future funding\nneeds prior to making an investment, many VCs ignore this number\nand come up with their own views of the future financing dynamics\nand the corresponding reserves amount. In our experience, entrepreneurs are often optimistic about how much capital they need,\nestimating on the low side. VCs will rely on their own experience\nwhen figuring out reserves and will often be conservative and estimate high early in the life of the investment, reducing this number\nover time as a company ages.\nLet’s look at how reserve analysis can impact a company. Assume\na venture capital firm has a $100 million fund and invests a total of\n$50 million into 10 different companies. Assume also that the venture capital firm has an aggregate of $50 million in reserves divided\nbetween the 10 companies. While it doesn’t matter if the firm is\naccurately reserved on a company by company basis at the beginning, the total amount reserved and how it is deployed over time are\ncritical. If the VC has underreserved and $70 million ends up being\nneeded in aggregate to support the ongoing funding of the 10 companies, the VC firm won’t have the ability to continue to fund all of\nthe companies it is an investor in. This usually results in VCs picking\nfavorites and not supporting some of the companies. Although this\ncan manifest itself as VCs simply walking away from their investments\nor being direct that they have no additional money to invest, the\nbehavior by the VC is usually more mysterious. The less upfront VC\nwill often actively resist additional financings, try to limit the size and\nsubsequently the dilution of these financings, or push you to sell the\ncompany. In cases where a pay-to-play term is in effect, you’ll often\nsee more resistance to additional financings as the venture capital\nfirm tries to protect its position in the company, even if it’s not necessarily the right thing to do for the business.\nOverreserving, or reserving $50 million when you ultimately\nneed only $30 million, is also an issue, but it doesn’t impact the entrepreneurs. Overreserving results in the VC underinvesting the fund,\nwhich is economically disadvantageous to the LPs and the VCs. The\nwww.itdf.ir\n140 Venture Deals\nLPs want all of the fund capital to be invested because it increases\nthe chance of returning more capital. The VCs also want to get all\nthe money to work, especially when funds become profi table, as the\ngreater the absolute return, the greater the carry.\n Most venture capital fund agreements allow a fi rm to raise a new\nfund once they are around 70% committed and reserved. While this\nthreshold varies by fi rms, it is usually reasonably high. As a result,\nthere is a slight motivation to overreserve to reach this threshold\nthat is countered by the negative economic dynamics of not fully\ninvesting the fund. Of course, independent of the threshold, the VC\nstill needs to have good performance and the support of the existing\ninvestors to raise a new fund.\nthe entrepreneur’s perspective\n You should understand how much capital the \u001f rm reserves for follow-on investments per company, or in the case of your company in particular. If you think\nyour company is likely to need multiple rounds of \u001f nancing, you want to make\nsure the VC has plenty of “dry powder” in reserve for your company so you don’t\nend up in contentious situations down the road in which your investor has no\nmore money left to invest and is then at odds with you or with future investors.\nCash Flow\n VCs have to pay as much attention to cash fl ow as entrepreneurs do,\nalthough many don’t until they run into trouble. Remember that the\ncapital raised by a venture fi rm can be used for investments in companies, management fees, and expenses of the fund, which include\npaying accountants for an annual audit and tax fi lings and paying\nlawyers for any litigation issues. Also remember that LPs want their\nVCs to invest 100% of the fund in companies.\n If a VC has a $100 million fund with a typical management fee,\napproximately $15 million will be spent on noninvesting activity\nduring the life of the fund. This means to fully invest the $100 million, the fund will need to generate $15 million of returns that it can\nrecycle—or invest—over the life of the fund. More important is that\ntiming matters since the exits that generate this additional cash are\nunpredictable, and as a fund gets later in its life, it can start to get\ninto a position where it doesn’t actually have the cash to recycle.\n In the most extreme case, the fi rm will underreserve and not\nmanage cash fl ow effectively. As a result, it will fi nd itself crunched\nwww.itdf.ir\now Venture Capital Funds Work 141\nat both ends. It won’t have adequate reserves to continue to support\nits investments and, even if it did, it won’t have the cash to pay its\nemployees through management fees. This situation can occur even\nin firms that have raised follow-on funds, as the cash flow dynamics\nof recycling are fund specific.\nCross-Fund Investing\nMany venture capital firms invest out of several linked fund entities\n(e.g., you may have two funds as investors in your fund—VC Fund III\nand VC Entrepreneurs Fund III); however, there are also cases where\nfirms will fund out of two completely separate funds, say VC Fund III\nand VC Fund IV. These are called cross-fund investments. Typically, you’ll\nsee this when the first fund (Fund III) is underreserved and the second\nfund (Fund IV) fills in the gap to help the venture capital firm as a\nwhole protect its position and provide support for the company.\nCross-fund investing can lead to several problems between the\nventure capital firm and its LPs. Cross-fund investing is rarely done\nfrom the beginning of an investment, so the later rounds are done at\na different price (not always higher) than the earlier rounds. Since\nthe underlying funds almost always have different LP composition\nand each fund will end up with a different return profile on the\nexit, the LPs won’t be treated economically equally across the investment. In the upside case where the valuation is steadily increasing,\nthis won’t matter, as everyone will be happy with the positive economic outcome. However, in the downside case, or an upside case\nwhere the round that the second fund invests in is a down round,\nthis is a no-win situation for the VC. In this situation, one fund will\nbe disadvantaged over the other and some LPs will end up in a worse\nsituation than they would have been in if the cross-fund investment\nhadn’t happened. And if our friendly VC thinks too hard, the economic conflict will start to melt his brain.\nThe one exception is when an early-stage firm creates a growth\nfund to invest in their successful companies. These funds are often\ncalled Opportunity or Select funds and are a logical way for earlystage investors to participate in their winners at later stages.\nDeparting artners\nMost venture capital firms have a key man clause that defines what\nhappens in the case in which a certain number of partners or a specific partner leaves the firm. In some cases, when a firm trips the key\nwww.itdf.ir\n142 Venture Deals\nman clause, the LPs have the right to suspend the ability of the fund\nto make new investments or can even shut down the fund. In cases\nwhere a partner leaves the firm but doesn’t trip the key man clause,\nthere are often contentious issues over firm economics, especially if\nthe firm has been poorly structured, doesn’t have appropriate vesting, or has a significant amount of economics in the hands of the\ndeparting partner, leaving the other partners with insignificant motivation (at least in their minds) for continuing to actively manage\nthe firm. While the entrepreneur can’t impact this, it’s important to\nbe sensitive to any potential dynamics in the structure of the firm,\nespecially if the departing partner is the one who sits on your board\nor has sponsored the investment in your company.\nCorporate Venture Capital\nIn the past few years we have seen the emergence of numerous corporate venture capital (CVC) groups. These are VCs who have a\nlarge corporation behind them, and are usually easy to identify since\nthey go by names like Google Ventures (now GV), Intel Ventures,\nQualcomm Ventures, Salesforce Ventures, and Microsoft Ventures.\nToday, there are several hundred CVCs. As with traditional venture\ncapital firms, they vary greatly in size, shape, strategy, and incentives.\nCVC, however, is not a new phenomenon, as it has been around\nfor decades. There was a huge increase in the number of CVCs in\nthe late 1990s leading up to the peak of the Internet bubble, with a\ncorrespondingly rapid evaporation of these firms after the Internet\nbubble burst. Over the past decade they’ve began to emerge again,\nwith a recent, rapid increase in the number of firms.\nUnlike a traditional VC that reports to its limited partners, CVCs\nmay answer to executive management teams, other company departments, public shareholders, or even quarterly results. While some\nCVCs are indistinguishable from traditional VCs, many CVCs invest\noff of their companies’ balance sheets and as a result don’t have separate fund structures. When the CVC is not a separate entity, but one\nthat reports up to the CEO or other executive (sometimes the chief\nfinancial officer [CFO]) of a large public company, many different\npressures come into play beside a direct focus on financial returns.\nAvailability of capital to invest shifts with changes in a company’s\nstock price and balance sheet, which can have significant impact on\na startup’s ability to raise additional capital from the CVC.\nwww.itdf.ir\now Venture Capital Funds Work 143\nTeams at CVCs often experience employee turnover, especially\nif the CVC has star performers who are incented with equity in their\npublic company rather than economics associated with their investment returns. These CVC partners are easy pickings for many traditional venture capital firms who are looking to grow as compensation, autonomy, and authority is often significantly higher in venture\ncapital firms than in CVCs.\nMotivations around valuation, structure, and control in subsequent financings or merger and acquisition (M&A) activity is often\ndifferent between VCs and CVCs. In addition to how a typical VC\nis motivated, CVCs often, but not always, have other interests in\nbecoming investors in your company including insight into your\ntechnology, partnering around a distribution channel or go to market approach, or locking out a competitor. As a result, CVCs are\noften willing to pay a higher valuation than VCs given these additional motivations. At the same time, CVCs often look for more\ncontrol, such as a first right of refusal on an acquisition (something\nyou should never, ever give). While the higher valuation might feel\ngood, realize that if it’s too high it may negatively impact your next\nround of financing.\nSome CVCs will take board seats, but many do not require\nanything beyond observer roles on the boards. Lawyers at a CVC\nparent company are often concerned about potential conflicts of\ninterest that might arise along with issues around information property linkage.\nCompensation varies widely between CVCs and often differs significantly from the management fee/carried interest approach of VC\nfirms. Many CVCs are simply employees of their parent companies\nwith salary, bonus, and stock option pay packages. In some cases, the\nCVC has a bonus plan tied to company performance, but it’s rarely\nequivalent to the economics of a traditional VC firm.\nFinally, be mindful of potential conflicts, especially around technology and customers. As one of the motivations for a CVCs is to have\ninsight and/or access to innovative companies and their products, they\noften are investing in companies they think can become large, longterm users of the CVC’s parent company technology and products.\nWhile this can be powerful, consider what happens to the relationship\nwhen you decide to use a competitor’s technology over that of your\nCVC or when one day you wake up and realize that the CVC’s parent\ncompany has come out with a product that competes with yours.\nwww.itdf.ir\n144 Venture Deals\nStrategic Investors\nWhile many CVCs also consider themselves strategic investors, there\nare many strategic investors that aren’t formalized as venture capital\ninvestors. These are companies that aren’t in the business of making\nventure capital investments, but for a particular reason want to invest\nin your company. For instance, suppose you produce a consumer\ndevice in China and your contract manufacturer tells you they want\nto invest in your company. While flattering, there are both positive\nand negative aspects to this.\nAs with CVCs, strategic investors are incentivized differently,\nhave different masters to answer to, and have varying motivations for\ntheir investments beyond overall returns.\nSuppose you are the founder of a company called SwearJar.com,\nwhich makes a wearable device that detects foul language uttered by\nthe wearer. Upon such detection, it automatically debits your bank\naccount and sends 80% of the proceeds to charity and 20% to SwearJar (yup, we’ve seen this, and are a particularly good customer target).\nYour product is manufactured at ChinaFab, Inc. and they’ve offered\nto invest $1 million in your company. They have indicated that they\ndon’t care about the valuation and are happy to participate at whatever your last round was priced at. You need the money, would love\nto be more tightly connected to your manufacturing partner, and\nare inclined to take it.\nBefore you get too excited, consider what will happen to their\nservice to you as your manufacturer. If they have experience making strategic investments, explore whether things have gotten better\nor worse after they made this strategic investment. In addition to\nseeing some strategic investors start taking companies like SwearJar\nfor granted after they’ve invested, people in the strategic partner\norganization begin to justify their performance as a result of having an investment in the company. Now, you want to hold them\naccountable by spinning up a competitive process for another contract manufacturer. At best, this is awkward and often can negatively\nimpact your business relationship. But, your strategic investor will\nstill be an equity owner of your company, making things even more\ncomplicated.\nOften, the strategic investor will be helpful and the relationship\nwill be a constructive one. For confident strategic investors, they often\nwww.itdf.ir\now Venture Capital Funds Work 145\nask for additional equity consideration for helping your company\nsucceed. While this ignores the fact that your VC investors aren’t getting additional equity compensation for helping you, strategic investors often feel entitled to something. In these cases, we encourage\nyou to use a performance warrant.\nAs with a regular warrant, a performance warrant is an option for\nthe strategic partner to buy stock in your company (usually common\nstock) at a set price (often the most recent financing round price).\nUnlike a regular warrant, the performance warrant is issued only\nwhen the strategic investor accomplishes predetermined performance goals. In this situation, if they perform, you reward them with\nthe performance warrant. If they don’t perform, they still received\ntheir equity in exchange for their investment, but they didn’t get the\nextra equity they were looking for.\nFiduciary Duties\nVCs owe fiduciary duties, concurrently and on the same importance\nlevel, to their management company, to the GP, to the LP, and to\neach board that they serve on. If your investor is a CVC or strategic\ninvestor, they will owe a fiduciary duty back to their parent organization. Normally, this all works out fine if one is dealing with a credible\nand legitimate firm, but even in the best of cases, these duties can\nconflict with one another and both VCs and CVCs can find themselves in a fiduciary sandwich.\nFor the entrepreneur, it’s important to remember that no matter how much you love your investors, they answer to other people\nand have a complex set of formal, legal responsibilities. Some investors understand this well, are transparent, and have a clearly defined\nset of internal guidelines when they find themselves in the midst of\nfiduciary conflicts. Others don’t and subsequently act in confusing,\ncomplicated, and occasionally difficult ways.\nMore annoyingly to those of us who understand this dynamic,\nsome investors pontificate about their fiduciary duties while not\nreally knowing what to do. If you ever feel uncomfortable with the\ndynamic, remember that your legal counsel represents your company and can help you cut through the noise to understand what is\nreally going on.\nwww.itdf.ir\n146 Venture Deals\nImplications for the ntrepreneur\nVCs’ motivations and financial incentives will show up in many ways\nthat may affect their judgment or impact them emotionally, especially in times of difficult or pivotal decisions for a company. Don’t\nbe blind to the issues that affect your investment partners. More\nimportantly, don’t be afraid to discuss these issues with them; an\nuncomfortable yet open discussion today could save you the trauma\nof a surprise and company-impacting interaction later.\nwww.itdf.ir\n147\n11C h a p t e r\nNegotiation actics \negardless of how much you know about term sheets, you still\nneed to be able to negotiate a good deal. We’ve found that most\npeople, including many lawyers, are weak negotiators. Fortunately\nfor our current and future portfolio company executives, they can\nread about everything we know online and in this book, so hopefully\nin addition to being better negotiators, they now know all of our\nmoves and can negotiate more effectively against us.\nThere are plenty of treatises on negotiations; however, this chapter walks through some negotiation tactics that have worked well for\nus over the years. Although this book is primarily about financings,\nwe’ll talk about a range of negotiation tactics that you can use in\nyour life, and we illustrate some of the different types of characters\nyou’ll probably meet along the way.\nWhat eally Matters?\nThere are only three things that matter when negotiating a financing: achieving a good and fair result, not killing your personal relationship getting there, and understanding the deal that you are\nstriking.\nIt has been said that a good deal means neither party is happy.\nThis might be true in litigation or acquisitions, but if neither party is\nhappy following the closing of a venture financing, then you have a\nreal problem. Remember, the financing is only the beginning of the\nrelationship and a small part at that. Building the company together\nVenture Deals: Be Smarter than Your Lawyer\nand Venture Capitalist, Third Edition\nBy Brad Feld and Jason Mendelson\nCopyright © 2016 by Brad Feld and Jason Mendelson\nwww.itdf.ir\n148 Venture Deals\n As for which deal terms matter, we’ve talked previously about\neconomics and control. We’d suggest that any signifi cant time you\nare spending negotiating beyond these two core concepts is a waste\nof time. You can learn a lot about the person you are negotiating\nwith by what that individual focuses on.\n Pick a few things that really matter—the valuation, stock option\npool, liquidation preferences, board, and voting controls—and be\ndone with it. The cliché “you never make money on terms” is especially true outside of a few key ones that we’ve dwelled on already.\nThe good karma that will attach to you from the other side (assuming they aren’t jerks) will be well worth it.\n preparing for the Negotiation\n The single biggest mistake people make during negotiation is a lack\nof preparation. It’s incredible to us that people will walk blindly into\na negotiation when so much is on the line. And this isn’t just about\nventure deals, as we’ve seen this behavior in all types of negotiations.\n Many people don’t prepare because they feel they don’t know\nwhat they should prepare for. We’ll give you some ideas, but realize\nthat you probably do know how to negotiate better than you think.\nYou already negotiate many times a day during your interactions in\nlife, but most people generally just do it and don’t think too hard\nabout it. If you have a spouse, child, auto mechanic, domesticated\nthe entrepreneur’s perspective\n Your lawyer shouldn’t be a jerk in manner or unreasonable in positions, but this\ndoesn’t mean you should advise your lawyer to behave in a milquetoast manner\nduring negotiations, especially if he is well versed in venture fi nancings. You\nneed to manage this carefully as the entrepreneur, even if your eyes glaze over\nat legalese. This is your company and your deal, not your lawyer’s.\nwhile having a productive and good relationship is what matters. A\ngreat starting point is for both sides to think they have achieved a fair\nresult and feel lucky to be in business with one another. If you behave\npoorly during the fi nancing, it’s likely that tensions will be strained for\nsome time if the deal actually gets closed. And if your lawyer behaved\nbadly during the negotiation, it’s likely that lawyer will be looking for a\nnew client after the venture capitalist (VC) joins the board.\nwww.itdf.ir\nNegotiation actics  149\nanimal, or any friends, chances are that you have dozens of negotiations every day.\nWhen you are going to negotiate your financing (or anything,\nreally), have a plan. Have key things that you want, understand which\nterms you are willing to concede, and know when you are willing to\nwalk away. If you try to determine this during the negotiation, your\nemotions are likely to get the best of you and you’ll make mistakes.\nAlways have a plan.\nNext, spend some time beforehand getting to know whom you\nare dealing with. Some people (like us) are so easy to find that you\ncan Google us and know just about everything we think. If we openly\nstate that we think people who negotiate registration rights in a term\nsheets are idiots (which we do), then why on Earth would you or your\nlawyer make a big deal about it? This being said, more than 50% of\nthe term sheet markups we get from lawyers have requested changes\nto the registration rights section, which makes us instantly look down\non the lawyer and know that the entrepreneur isn’t the one running\nthe show. (Yes, we keep a list of these law firms.)\nIf you get to know the other side ahead of time, you might also\nbe able to play to their strengths, weaknesses, biases, curiosities, and\ninsecurities. The saying “knowledge is power” applies here. And\nremember, just because you can gain the upper hand in using this\ntype of knowledge doesn’t mean that you have to, but it will serve as\na security blanket and might be necessary if things turn south.\nOne thing to remember: everyone has an advantage over everyone else in all negotiations. There might be a David to the Goliath, but\neven David knew a few things that the big man didn’t. Life is the same\nway. Figure out your superpower and your adversary’s kryptonite.\nIf you are a first-time, 20-something entrepreneur negotiating a\nterm sheet against a 40-something, well-weathered, and experienced\nVC, what possible advantage could you have on the VC? The VC\nclearly understands the terms better. The VC also has a ton of market\nknowledge. And let’s assume that this VC is the only credible funding source that you have. Sounds pretty bleak, right?\nWell, yes, but don’t despair. There is one immediate advantage\nthat you probably have: time. If we generalize, it’s easy to come up\nwith a scenario of the VC having a family and lots of portfolio companies and investors to deal with. You, on the other hand, have one\nsingular focus: your company and this negotiation. You can afford to\nmake the process a longer one than the VC might want. In fact, most\nwww.itdf.ir\n150 Venture Deals\nexperienced VCs really hate this part of the process and will bend on\nterms in order to aid effi ciency, although some won’t and will nitpick\nevery point (we’ll deal with those folks later). Perhaps you’ll want to\nset up your negotiation call at the end of the day, right before the\nVC’s dinner. Or maybe you’ll sweetly ask your VC to explain a host of\nterms that you “don’t understand” and further put burdens on the\nVC’s time. Think this doesn’t happen? After we gave this advice to\nsome of the Techstars (see www.techstars.com ) teams in 2009, one\nof the teams waited until two hours before Jason left on vacation to\nnegotiate the term sheet we gave them. Jason didn’t even recognize\nthis as their strategy and fi gured it was bad luck with timing. As a\nresult, he faced time pressure that was artifi cially manufactured by\na 20-something fi rst-time entrepreneur. Nice job, Alex. (Alex White,\nformer CEO of Next Big Sound, which was acquired by Pandora).\n There are advantages all over the place. Is your VC a huge Stanford fan? Chat her up and fi nd out if she has courtside seats to the\ngame. Is your VC into a charity that you care about? Use this information to connect with her so she becomes more sympathetic. While\nsimple things like this are endless, what matters is that you have a\nplan, know the other side, and consider what natural advantages you\nhave. In a perfect world, you won’t have to use any of these tools, but\nif you need them and don’t bring them to the actual negotiation, it’s\nyour loss.\nthe entrepreneur’s perspective\n Your biggest advantage is to have a solid Plan B—lots of interest and competition for your deal. VCs will fold like a house of cards on all peripheral terms if\nyou have another comparable quality VC waiting in the wings to work with you.\n a Brief Introduction to Game theory\n Everyone has a natural negotiating style. These styles have analogues\nthat can work either well or poorly in trying to achieve a negotiated\nresult. It’s important to understand how certain styles work well\ntogether, how some confl ict, and how some have inherent advantages\nover one another.\n Before we delve into that, let’s spend a little time on basic game\ntheory. Game theory is a mathematical theory that deals with strategies\nwww.itdf.ir\nNegotiation actics  151\nfor maximizing gains and minimizing losses within prescribed constraints, such as the rules of a card game. Game theory is widely applied\nin the solution of various decision-making problems, such as those of\nmilitary strategy and business policy.\nGame theory states that there are rules underlying situations\nthat affect how these situations will be played out. These rules are\nindependent of the humans involved and will predict and change\nhow humans interact within the constructs of the situation. Knowing\nwhat these invisible rules are is of major importance when entering\ninto any type of negotiation.\nThe most famous of all games is the prisoner’s dilemma, which you’ve\nseen many times if you’ve ever watched a cop show on television. The\nsimple form, as described in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\n(http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/prisoner-dilemma/#Sym2t2PDOrd\nPay), follows:\nTanya and Cinque have been arrested for robbing the Hibernia\nSavings Bank and placed in separate isolation cells. Both care\nmuch more about their personal freedom than about the welfare of their accomplice. A clever prosecutor makes the following offer to each. “You may choose to confess or remain silent.\nIf you confess and your accomplice remains silent, I will drop all\ncharges against you and use your testimony to ensure that your\naccomplice does serious time. Likewise, if your accomplice confesses while you remain silent, they will go free while you do the\ntime. If you both confess, I get two convictions, but I’ll see to it\nthat you both get early parole. If you both remain silent, I’ll have\nto settle for token sentences on firearms possession charges. If\nyou wish to confess, you must leave a note with the jailer before\nmy return tomorrow morning.”\nThe classic prisoner’s dilemma can be summarized as shown in\nthe following table.\nClassic risoner’s Dilemma\nPrisoner B Stays Silent Prisoner B Betrays\nPrisoner A Stays Silent Each serves 8 months Prisoner A: 12 years\nPrisoner B: goes free\nPrisoner A Betrays Prisoner A: goes free\nPrisoner B: 12 years\nEach serves 5 years\nwww.itdf.ir\n152 Venture Deals\nWhat’s fascinating about this is that there is a fundamental rule\nin this game that demonstrates why two people might not cooperate\nwith one another, even if it is clearly in their best interests to do so.\nIf the two prisoners cooperate, the outcome is best, in the aggregate, for both of them. They each get eight months of jail time\nand walk away. But the game forces different behavior. Regardless\nof what the co-conspirator chooses (silence versus betrayal), each\nplayer always receives a lighter sentence by betraying the other. In\nother words, no matter what the other guy does, you are always better off by ratting him out.\nThe other rule to this game is that it is a single-play game. In other\nwords, the participants play the game once and their fate is cast.\nOther games are multiplay games. For instance, there is a lot of interesting game theory about battlegrounds. If you are in one trench\nfighting and we are in another, game theory would suggest that\nwe would not fight at night, on weekends, on holidays, and during\nmeals. Why not? It would seem logical that if we know you are sleeping, it’s the absolute best time to attack.\nWell, it’s not, unless we can completely take you out with one\nstrike. Otherwise, you’ll most likely start attacking us during dinner,\non holidays, or while we are watching Mad Men. And then not only\nare we still fighting, but now we’ve both lost our free time. This tit-fortat strategy is what keeps multiplay games at equilibrium. If you don’t\nmess with us during our lunch break, we won’t mess with you during\nyours. And everyone is better off. But if you do mess with us, we’ll\ncontinue to mess with you until you are nice to us again.\nWhen you are considering which game you are playing, consider\nnot only whether there are forces at work that influence the decisions being made, like the prisoner’s dilemma, but also how many\ntimes a decision will be made. Is this a one-shot deal, or will this\ngame repeat itself, lending increased importance to precedent and\nreputation?\nNegotiating in the Game of Financings\nA venture financing is one of the easiest games there is. First, you\nreally can have a win-win outcome where everyone is better off.\nSecond, you don’t negotiate in a vacuum like your hypothetical\nfellow criminal co-conspirator. Finally, and most important, this is\nnot a single instance game. Therefore, reputation and the fear of\ntit-for-tat retaliation are real considerations.\nwww.itdf.ir\nNegotiation tactics  153\n Since the VC and entrepreneur will need to spend a lot of time\ntogether post investment, the continued relationship makes it important to look at the fi nancing as just one negotiation in a very long,\nmultiplay game. Doing anything that would give the other party an\nincentive to retaliate in the future is not a wise, or rational, move.\n Furthermore, for the VC, this fi nancing is but one of many that\nthe VC will hope to complete. Therefore, the VC should be thinking\nabout reputational factors that extend well beyond this particular\ninteraction. With the maturation of the venture capital industry, it’s\neasy to get near-perfect information on most VCs. Having a negative\nreputation can be fatal to a VC in the long run.\n Not all VCs recognize that each negotiation isn’t a single-round,\nwinner-take-all game. Generally, the more experience VCs have, the\nbetter their perspective is, but this lack of a longer-term view is not\nlimited to junior VCs. While we’ll often see this behavior more from\nthe lawyers representing the VCs or the entrepreneurs, we also see it\nfrom the business principals. When we run across people like this, at\na minimum we lose a lot of respect for them and occasionally decide\nnot to do business with them. When you encounter VCs who either\nhave a reputation for or are acting as though every negotiation is a\nsingle-round, winner-take-all game, you should be very cautious.\nthe entrepreneur’s perspective\n One successful negotiating tactic is to ask VCs up front, before the term sheet\nshows up, what the three most important terms are in a fi nancing for them. You\nshould know and be prepared to articulate your top three wants as well. This\nconversation can set the stage for how you think about negotiating down the\nroad, and it can be helpful to you when you are in the heat of a negotiation. If\nthe VCs are pounding hard on a point that is not one of their stated top three,\nit’s much easier to call them out on that fact and note that they are getting most\nor all of their main points.\n Game theory is also useful because of the other types of negotiations you’ll have. For instance, if you decide to sell your company,\nyour acquisition discussions can be similar to the prisoner’s dilemma\nas presented earlier. Customer negotiations usually take on the feeling of a single-round game, despite any thoughts to the contrary\nabout partnerships. And litigation almost always takes the form of a\nsingle-round game, even when the parties will have ongoing relationships beyond the resolution of the litigation.\nwww.itdf.ir\n154 Venture Deals\nRemember, you can’t change the game you are in, but you can\njudge people who play poorly within it. And having a game theory\nlens to view the other side is very useful.\nNegotiating Styles and pproaches\nEvery person has a natural negotiating style that is often the part\nof your personality that you adopt when you are dealing with conflict. Few people have truly different modes for negotiation, but that\ndoesn’t mean you can’t practice having a range of different behaviors that depend on the situation you are in.\nMost good negotiators know where they are comfortable, but\nalso know how to play upon and against other people’s natural styles.\nFollowing are some of the personalities you’ll meet and how you\nmight want to best work with them.\nThe Bully (aka UAW Negotiator)\nThe bully negotiates by yelling and screaming, forcing issues, and\nthreatening the other party. Most folks who are bullies aren’t that\nsmart and don’t really understand the issues; rather, they try to win\nby force. There are two ways to deal with bullies: punch them in the\nnose or mellow out so much that you sap their strength. If you can\noutbully the bully, go for it. But if you are wrong, then you’ve probably ignited a volcano. Unlike the children’s playground, getting hit\nby a bully during a negotiation generally doesn’t hurt; so unless this\nis your natural negotiating style, our advice is to chill out as your\nadversary gets hotter.\nThe Nice Guy (aka Used-Car Salesman)\nWhenever you interact with this pleasant person, you feel like he’s\ntrying to sell you something. Often, you aren’t sure that you want\nwhat he’s selling. When you say no, the nice guy will either be openly\ndisappointed or will keep on smiling at you just like the audience\nat a Tony Robbins event. In their world, life is great as long as you\nacquiesce to their terms (or buy this clean 2006 Chrysler Sebring).\nAs the negotiation unfolds, the nice guy is increasingly hard to pin\ndown on anything. While the car salesman always needs to go talk\nto his manager, the nice-guy negotiator regularly responds with “Let\nme consider that and get back to you.” While the nice guy doesn’t\nwww.itdf.ir\nNegotiation actics  155\nyell at you like the bully, it’s often frustrating that you can never get\na real answer or seemingly make progress. Our advice is to be clear\nand direct and don’t get worn down, as the nice guys will happily talk\nto you all day. If all else fails, don’t be afraid to toss a little bully into\nthe mix on your side to move things forward.\nThe Technocrat (aka Pocket Protector Guy)\nThis is the technical nerd guy. Although he won’t yell at you like the\nbully and you don’t wonder if there is a real human being behind\nthe facade like you do with the nice guy, you will feel like you are\nin endless detail hell. The technocrat has a billion issues and has\na hard time deciding what’s really important, since to him everything is important for some reason. Our advice is to grin and bear it\nand perhaps play Pokémon GO while you are listening to the other\nside drone on. Technocrats tend to cause you to lose your focus during the negotiation. Make sure you don’t by remembering what you\ncare about and conceding the other points. But make sure you cover\nall the points together, as the technocrat will often negotiate every\npoint from scratch, not taking into consideration the give-and-take\nof each side during the negotiation.\nThe Wimp (aka George McFly)\nThe wimp may sound like the perfect dance partner here, but he\nhas his own issues. Our bet is that you can take his wallet pretty easily\nduring the negotiation, but if you get too good a deal it will come\nback to haunt you. And then you get to live with him on your board\nof directors once you close your financing. With the wimp, you end\nup negotiating both sides of the deal. Sometimes this is harder than\nhaving a real adversary.\nThe Curmudgeon (aka Archie Bunker)\nWith the curmudgeon, everything you negotiate sucks. No matter\nwhat you arrive at is horrible, and every step along the way during\nthe negotiation will feel like a dentist tugging on a tight molar at the\nback of your mouth. Unlike the bully, the curmudgeon won’t yell;\nand unlike the nice guy, she’s never happy. While it’ll seem like she\ndoesn’t care too much about the details, she’s just never happy with\nany position you are taking. The curmudgeon is also not a wimp;\nwww.itdf.ir\n156 Venture Deals\n Always Be Transparent\n What about the normal dude? You know, the transparent, nice,\nsmart, levelheaded person you hope to meet on the other side of the\ntable? Though they exist, everyone has some inherent styles that will\nfi nd their way into the negotiation, especially if pressed or negotiations aren’t going well. Make sure you know which styles you have so\nyou won’t surprise yourself with a sudden outburst. You’ll also see a\nlot of these behaviors come out real-time in board meetings when\nthings aren’t going quite as well as hoped.\n If you are capable of having multiple negotiating personalities,\nwhich should you favor? We’d argue that in a negotiation that has\nreputational and relationship value, try to be the most transparent\nand easygoing that you can be, to let the other person inside your\nthinking and get to know you for who you really are. If you are playing a single-round game, like an acquisition negotiation with a party\nyou don’t ever expect to do business with again, do like Al Davis says:\n“Just win, baby.” As in sports, don’t ever forget that a good tactic is to\nchange your game plan suddenly to keep the other side on their toes.\n Collaborative Negotiation versus Walk-away threats\n Of all the questions we get regarding negotiations, the most common is when to walk away from a deal. Most people’s blood pressure\nticks up a few points with the thought of walking away, especially\nthe entrepreneur’s perspective\n You learn a lot about a person in a negotiation. This is one argument for doing\nas much of the detailed negotiation before signing a term sheet that includes\na no-shop clause in it. If you fi nd that your potential investor is a jerk to you in\nnegotiating your deal, you may want to think twice about this person becoming\na board member and member of your inner circle.\nshe’s been around the block before and will remind you of that every\nchance she gets. In a lot of ways, the curmudgeon is like a cranky\ngrandmother. If you are patient, upbeat, and tolerant, you’ll eventually get what you want, but you’ll never really please her because\neveryone pisses her off.\nwww.itdf.ir\nNegotiation actics  157\nafter you’ve invested a lot of time and energy (especially emotional\nenergy) in a negotiation. In considering whether to walk away from\na negotiation, preparation is key here—know what your walk-away\npoint is before starting the negotiation so it’s a rational and deliberate decision rather than an emotional one made in the heat of the\nmoment.\nWhen determining your walk-away position, consider your best\nalternative to negotiated agreement, also known in business school circles\nas BATNA. Specifically, what is your backup plan if you aren’t successful reaching an agreement? The answer to this varies wildly depending on the circumstances. In a financing, if you are lucky, your\nbackup plan may be accepting your second-favorite term sheet from\nanother VC. It could mean bootstrapping your company and forgoing a financing. Understanding BATNA is important in any negotiation, such as an acquisition (walk away as a stand-alone company),\nlitigation (settle versus go to court), and customer contract (walk\naway rather than get stuck in a bad deal).\nBefore you begin any negotiation, make sure you know where\nyour overall limits are, as well as your limits on each key point. If\nyou’ve thought this through in advance, you’ll know when someone\nis trying to move you past one of these boundaries. It’s also usually\nobvious when someone tries to pretend they are at a boundary when\nthey really aren’t. Few people are able to feign true conviction.\nAt some point in some negotiation, you’ll find yourself up\nagainst the wall or being pushed into a zone that is beyond where\nyou are willing to go. In this situation, tell the other party there is\nno deal, and walk away. As you walk away, be very clear with what\nyour walk-away point is so the other party will be able to reconsider\ntheir position. If you are sincere in walking away and the other party\nis interested enough in a deal, they’ll likely be back at the table at\nsome point and will offer you something that you can stomach. If\nthey don’t reengage, the deal wasn’t meant to be.\nDepending on the type of person you are negotiating with, the\nVC either will be sensitive to your boundaries or will force you outside these boundaries, where BATNA will come into effect. If this is\nhappening regularly during your financing negotiation, think hard\nabout whether this is a VC that you want to be working with, as this\nVC is likely playing a single-round game in a relationship that will\nhave many rounds and lots of ups and downs along the way.\nwww.itdf.ir\n158 Venture Deals\n Finally, don’t ever make a threat during a negotiation that you\naren’t willing to back up. If you bluff and aren’t willing to back up\nyour position, your bargaining position is forever lost in this negotiation. The 17th time we hear “and that’s our fi nal offer,” we know that\nthere’s another, better offer coming if we just hold out for number 18.\n Building Leverage and Getting to Yes\n Besides understanding the issues and knowing how to deal with the\nother party, there are certain things that you can do to increase your\nnegotiation leverage. In a VC fi nancing, the best way to gain leverage\nis to have competing term sheets from different VCs.\n If you happen to be lucky enough to have several interested parties, this will be the single biggest advantage in getting good deal\nterms. However, it’s a tricky balance dealing with multiple parties at\nthe same time. You have to worry about issues of transparency and\ntiming and, if you play them incorrectly, you might fi nd yourself in a\nsituation where no one wants to work with you.\nthe entrepreneur’s perspective\n As I mentioned earlier, having a solid Plan B (and a Plan C, and a Plan D . . .) is\none of your most effective weapons during the negotiation process. It’s helpful to\nbe reasonably transparent about that fact to all prospective investors. While it’s\na good practice to withhold some information, such as the names of the other\npotential investors with whom you’re speaking since there is no reason to enable\ntwo VCs to talk about your deal behind your back, telling investors that you have\nlegitimate interest from other fi rms will serve you very well in terms of speeding\nthe process along and improving your end result.\n For starters, pay attention to timing. You’ll want to try to drive\neach VC to deliver a term sheet to you in roughly the same time\nframe. This pacing can be challenging since there will be uncomfortable days when you’ll end up slow rolling one party while you seek to\nspeed up the process of another fi rm. This is hard to do, but if you\ncan get VCs to approve a fi nancing around the same time, you’re in a\nmuch stronger position than if you have one term sheet in hand that\nyou are trying to use to generate additional term sheets.\n Once you’ve received a term sheet from a VC, you can use this\nto motivate action from other VCs, but you have to walk a fi ne\nline between oversharing and being too secretive. We prefer when\nwww.itdf.ir\nNegotiation actics  159\nentrepreneurs are up front, tell us that they have other interests,\nand let us know where in the process they are. We never ask to\nsee other term sheets, and we’d recommend that you don’t ever\nshow your actual term sheets to other investors. More important,\nyou should never disclose whom you are talking to, as one of the\nfirst emails most interested VCs will send after hearing about other\nVCs who are interested in a deal is something like “Hey, I hear you\nare interested in investing in X—want to share notes?” As a result,\nyou probably no longer have a competitive situation between the\ntwo VCs, as they will now talk about your deal and in many cases\ntalk about teaming up. The exception, of course, is when you want\nthem to team up and join together in a syndicate.\nAt the end of the day, if you have multiple term sheets, most of\nthe deal terms will collapse into the same range (usually entrepreneur\nfavorable), and the only real things you’ll be negotiating are valuation\nand board control. You can signal quite effectively what your other\noptions might be. Whatever you do, don’t sign a term sheet and then\npull a Brett Favre and change your mind the next day. The startup\necosystem is small, and word travels fast. Reputation is important.\nAnother strategy that can help you build leverage is to anchor\non certain terms. Anchoring means to pick a few points, state clearly\nwhat you want, and then stick to your guns. If you anchor on positions\nthat are reasonable while still having a little flexibility to give in the\nnegotiation, you will likely get close to what you want as long as you\nare willing to trade away other points that aren’t as important to you.\nAlthough you should try to pace the negotiation, you should do\nthis only after the VC has offered up the first term sheet. Never provide\na term sheet to a VC, especially with a price attached, since if you do\nyou’ve just capped what you can expect to get in the deal. You are always\nin a stronger position to react to what the VC offers, especially when you\nhave multiple options. However, once you’ve gotten a term sheet,\nyou should work hard to control the pace of the ensuing negotiation.\nAs with any type of negotiation, it helps to feed the ego of your\npartner. Figure out what the other side wants to hear and try to\nplease them. People tend to reciprocate niceties. For example, if you\nare dealing with technocrats, engage them in depth on some of the\ndeal points, even if the points don’t matter to you, in order to make\nthem happy and help them feel like you are playing their game.\nWhen you are leading the negotiation, we highly recommend\nthat you have a strategy about the order in which you will address\nwww.itdf.ir\n160 Venture Deals\nthe points. Your options are to address them either in the order that\nthey are laid out in the term sheet or in some other random order of\nyour choosing. In general, once you are a skilled negotiator, going\nin order is more effective, as you won’t reveal which points matter\nmost to you. Often, experienced negotiators will try to get agreement on a point-by-point basis in order to prevent the other party\nfrom looking holistically at the process and determining whether a\nfair deal is being achieved. This strategy really works only if you have\na lot of experience, and it can really backfi re on you if the other party\nis more experienced and takes control of the discussion. Instead of\nbeing on the giving end of a divide-and-conquer strategy, you’ll be\non the receiving end of death by a thousand cuts.\n Unless you are a very experienced negotiator, we suggest an order\nwhere you start with some important points that you think you can\nget to yes quickly. This way, both parties will feel good that they are\nmaking progress toward a deal. Maybe it’s liquidation preferences\nor the stock option plan allocation. Then dive into the minutiae.\nValuation is probably the last subject to address, as you’ll most likely\nget closure on other terms but have a couple of different rounds of\ndiscussion on valuation. It is completely normal for some terms to\ndrag out longer than others.\n things Not to Do\n There are a few things that you’ll never want to do when negotiating a fi nancing for your company. As we stated earlier, don’t present\nyour term sheet to a VC. In addition to signaling inexperience, you\nget no benefi t by playing your hand fi rst since you have no idea what\nthe VC will offer you. The likely result is either you’ll end up starting\nin a worse place than the VC would have offered, or you’ll put silly\nterms out there that will make you look like a rookie. If your potential funding partner tells you to propose the terms, be wary, as it’s an\nindication that you are talking to either someone who isn’t a professional VC or someone who is professionally lazy.\nthe entrepreneur’s perspective\n You should never make an offer fi rst. There’s no reason to, unless you have\nanother concrete one on the table. Why run the risk of aiming too low?\nwww.itdf.ir\nNegotiation tactics  161\n If the other party is controlling the negotiation, don’t address\ndeal points in order of the legal paper. This is true of all negotiations,\nnot just fi nancings. If you allow a person to address each point and\ntry to get to closure before moving on to the next point, you will lose\nsight of the deal as a whole. While you might feel that the resolution\non each point is reasonable, when you refl ect on the entire deal you\nmay be unhappy. If a party forces you into this mode, don’t concede\npoints. Listen and let the other party know that you’ll consider their\nposition after you hear all of their comments to the document. Many\nlawyers are trained to do exactly this—to kill you softly point by point.\n A lot of people rely on the same arguments over and over again\nwhen negotiating. People who negotiate regularly, including many\nVCs and lawyers, try to convince the other side to acquiesce by stating, “That’s the way it is because it’s market.” We love hearing the\nmarket argument because then we know that our negotiating partner is a weak negotiator. Saying that “it’s market” is like your parents\ntelling you, “Because I said so,” and you responding, “But everyone’s\ndoing it.” These are elementary negotiating tactics that should have\nended around the time you left for college.\n In the world of fi nancings, you’ll hear this all the time. Rather\nthan getting frustrated, recognize that it’s not a compelling argument since the concept of market terms isn’t the sole justifi cation for\na negotiation position. Instead, probe on why the market condition\napplies to you. In many cases, the other party won’t be able to justify\nit and, if they can’t make the argument, you’ll immediately have the\nhigher ground.\nthe entrepreneur’s perspective\n As the old cliché goes, there’s a reason you have two ears and one mouth. When\nyou are negotiating, try to listen more than you talk, especially at the beginning\nof the negotiation.\n Next, make sure you know when to talk and when to listen. If you\nremember nothing else about this section, remember this: you can’t\nlose a deal point if you don’t open your mouth. Listening gives you\nfurther information about the other party, including what advantages you have over them (e.g., do they have a Little League baseball\ngame to coach in an hour?) and which negotiation styles they are\nmost comfortable with.\nwww.itdf.ir\n162 Venture Deals\n Finally, never assume that the other side has the same ethical\ncode as you. This isn’t a comment against VCs or lawyers; rather, it’s\na comment about life and pertains to every type of negotiation you’ll\nfi nd yourself involved in. Everyone has a different acceptable ethical\ncode, and it can change depending on the context of the negotiations. For instance, if you were to lie about the current state of a key\ncustomer to a prospective VC and it was discovered before the deal\nclosed, you’d most likely fi nd your deal blown up. Or perhaps the\ndeal would close, but you’d be fi red afterward, and it’s likely that\nsome of your peers would hear about it. As a result, both parties\n(VC and entrepreneur) have solid motivation to behave in an ethical way during a fi nancing. Note that this is directly in contrast to\nmost behavior, at least between lawyers, in a litigation context where\nlies and half-truths are an acceptable part of that game. Regardless\nof the specifi c negotiation context, make sure you know the ethical\ncode of the party you are negotiating against.\n Great Lawyers versus Bad Lawyers versus No Lawyers\n Regardless of how much you think you know or how much you’ve\nread, hire a great lawyer. In many cases you will be the least experienced person around the negotiating table. VCs negotiate for a\nliving, and a great lawyer on your side will help balance things out.\nWhen choosing a lawyer, make sure she not only understands the\ndeal mechanics, but also has a style that you like working with and\nthat you are comfortable sitting alongside of. This last point can’t be\noverstated—your lawyer is a refl ection of you, and if you choose a\nlawyer who is inexperienced, is ineffective, or behaves inconsistently,\nit will refl ect poorly on you and decrease your negotiating credibility.\n So choose a great lawyer, but make sure you know what great\nmeans. Ask multiple entrepreneurs you respect whom they use. Check\nthe entrepreneur’s perspective\n Understanding market terms and whether they apply to your situation is important. You can quickly get context on this by talking to other entrepreneurs in\nsimilar positions. Remember, you do only a few of these deals in your lifetime,\nand your VC does them for a living. Understand what market really is, and you’ll\nbe able to respond to an assertion that something is market with fact rather than\nwith emotion.\nwww.itdf.ir\nNegotiation tactics  163\n Can You Make a Bad Deal Better?\n Let’s say you screw up and negotiate a bad deal. You had only one\nterm sheet, the VC was a combination bully and technocrat, and you\nare now stuck with deal terms that you don’t love. Should you spend\nall of your time being depressed? Nope, there are plenty of ways to\nfi x things after the fact that most entrepreneurs never think about.\n First of all, until an exit—either an acquisition or an IPO—many\nof the terms don’t matter much. But, more importantly, if you plan\nto raise another round led by a new investor, you have a potential\nally at the time to clean up the things you negotiated poorly in the\nfi rst investment. The new VC will be motivated to make sure you and\nyour team are happy (assuming the company is performing), and if\nyou talk to your new potential fi nancing partner about issues that are\ntroubling you, in many cases the new VC will concentrate on trying\nto bring these back into balance in the new fi nancing.\n In the case where a new VC doesn’t lead the next round, you still\nhave the option of sitting down with your current VCs after you’ve\nhad some run time together (again, assuming success). We’ve been\ninvolved in numerous cases in which these were very constructive\nconversations that resulted in entrepreneur-friendly modifi cations\nto a deal.\nthe entrepreneur’s perspective\n Choosing a great lawyer doesn’t mean hiring an expensive lawyer from a fi rm\nthat your VC knows or recommends. Often for startups, going to a top-tier law\nfi rm means dealing with a second-tier or very junior lawyer, not well supervised,\nwith high billing rates. You can hire a smaller fi rm with lower rates and partner\nattention just as well; but be sure to do your homework on them, make sure\nthey’re experienced in dealing with venture fi nancings, and get references—\neven from VCs they’ve negotiated against in the past.\naround your local entrepreneurial community for the lawyers with the\nbest reputations. Don’t limit your exploration to billing rates, responsiveness, and intellect, but also check style and how contentious negotiations were resolved. Furthermore, it’s completely acceptable to\nask your VC before and after the funding what the VC’s thoughts are\nabout your lawyer.\nwww.itdf.ir\n164 Venture Deals\n Finally, you can wait until the exit and deal with your issues then.\nMost acquisition negotiations include a heavy focus on retention\ndynamics for the management team going forward, and there are\noften cases of reallocating some of the proceeds from the investors\nto management. The style of your VCs will impact how this plays out.\nIf they are playing a single-round game with the negotiation and\nthey don’t really care what happens after the deal closes, they will be\ninfl exible. However, if they want to be in a position to invest with you\nagain in the future, they’ll take a top-down view of the situation and\nbe willing to work through modifi cations to the deal terms to reallocate some consideration to management and employees, especially\nin a retention situation for the acquirer.\n Recognize, however, that this dynamic cuts both ways—many\nacquirers take the approach that they want to recut the economics\nin favor of the entrepreneur. Remember that as an entrepreneur you\nsigned up for the deal you currently have with your investors and you\nhave a corresponding responsibility to them. If you end up playing\na single-round game with your investors where you team up with the\nacquirer, you run the risk of blowing up both the acquisition and\nyour relationship with your investors. So, be thoughtful, fair, and\nopen with your investors around the incentives and dynamics.\nthe entrepreneur’s perspective\n Having an open and collaborative approach with your VC in the context of an\nacquisition may sound a bit like a game of chicken—but it can work. Being\nclear with your investors about what is important to you and your team early in\nthe negotiation can help set a tone where you and your investors are working\ntogether to reach the right deal structure, especially when the acquirer is trying\nto drive a wedge between you and those investors. A negotiation in a state of\nplenty is much easier than a negotiation in a state of scarcity.\n In our experience, openness in these situations of both the entrepreneur and the VC generally results in much better outcomes. It’s\nhard enough to engage in a negotiation, let alone one in which there\nare multiple parties in a negotiation at cross-purposes (e.g., acquirer,\nentrepreneur, and VC). We always encourage entrepreneurs and\ntheir VC backers to keep focused on doing what is right for all shareholders in the context of whatever is being offered, and as a result to\ncontinue to constructively work through any issues, especially if one\nparty is uncomfortable with where they previously ended up.\nwww.itdf.ir\n165\n12C h a p t e r\naising Money the ight Way\nWhile most people ask themselves “What should I do?” when\nseeking venture capitalist (VC) financing, there are also some things\nthat a person should not do. Doing any of the following at best makes\nyou look like a rookie (which is okay, we were all rookies once, but\nyou don’t want to look like one) and at worst kills any chance that\nyou have of getting funded by the VC you just contacted. While this\nchapter isn’t about the best way to fundraise (there are many other\nbooks covering that), we encourage you to avoid doing the following\nwhen you are raising money from VCs.\nDon’t Be a Machine\nWhile you may have created the greatest technology in the world to\ninvest in, fundraising is ultimately about the people involved. If a VC\ndoesn’t like you personally, they probably won’t invest in you despite\nyour brilliant idea.\nWe tell entrepreneurs that we want to fall in love with them in the\nstyle of “first date” energy. We want to feel time slip away and regret\nwhen we must go onto our next commitment. After you leave, we want\nto keep thinking about you and wondering when we’ll get to meet again.\nSome others call this the “beer test.” If we don’t want to have a\nbeer with you now, imagine how bad it will be when things inevitably get tough later on down the road. Being from Boulder, we also\naccept chai lattes or Vitaminwater as substitutes.\nSo, don’t be a machine. Be human. Be yourself, let us get to\nknow you, and become inspired by you. As the average length of\nVenture Deals: Be Smarter than Your Lawyer\nand Venture Capitalist, Third Edition\nBy Brad Feld and Jason Mendelson\nCopyright © 2016 by Brad Feld and Jason Mendelson\nwww.itdf.ir\n166 Venture Deals\nrelationship between a VC and an entrepreneur lasts longer than\nthe average U.S. marriage, this is a long-term commitment. It’s not\njust about the idea and the PowerPoint slides.\nDon’t sk for a Nondisclosure greement\nDon’t ask a VC for a nondisclosure agreement (NDA). Although most\nVCs will respect how unique your idea, innovation, or company is to\nyou, it’s likely that they’ve seen similar things due to the sheer number of business plans that they get. If they sign an NDA regarding\nany company, they’d likely run afoul of it if they ended up funding a\ncompany that you consider a competitor. An NDA will also prevent\na VC from talking to other VCs about your company, even ones who\nmight be good co-investors for your financing.\nHowever, don’t be too scared about approaching a reputable VC\nwith your idea without an NDA. The VC industry is small and wouldn’t\nlast long if VCs spoke out of turn sharing people’s knowledge with\none another. And don’t think that VCs will steal your idea and start a\ncompany, as reputational constraints as well as limits on a VC’s time\nwill eliminate this risk in most cases. Though you might occasionally\nrun into a bad actor, do your homework and you’ll generally be fine.\nDon’t mail Carpet Bomb VCs\nYou might not know VCs personally, but the way to get to know them\nis not by buying a mailing list and sending personalized spam. And\nit’s not good to hire an investment adviser who will do the same. VCs\nknow when they are getting a personal pitch versus spam, and we\ndon’t know any VCs who react well to spam.\nSpamming looks lazy. If you didn’t take the time to really think\nabout who would be a good funding partner, what does that say\nabout how you run the rest of the business? If you want to contact\nus, just email us, but make it personal to us. Be thoughtful, specific,\nand strategic with your first communication attempt. You don’t get a\nsecond chance to make a first impression, and you are being judged\nfor much more than your idea and your bio.\nNo Often Means No\nWhile most VCs appreciate persistence, when they say they aren’t\ninterested, they usually mean it. We aren’t asking you to try again.\nwww.itdf.ir\nraising Money the right Way 167\nWe might be saying no because your idea isn’t personally interesting\nto us, doesn’t fi t our current investment themes, or is something that\nwe think is a bad idea—or just because we are too busy. One thing\nto know is that us saying no doesn’t mean that your idea is stupid; it\njust means it isn’t for us.\n Don’t ask for a referral If You Get a No\n VCs get a lot of inbound email from entrepreneurs (and bankers\nand lawyers) pitching new investments. At our fi rm, we try to look at\nall of them and always attempt to respond within a day. We say no to\nmost of them, but we are happy to be on the receiving end of them\n(and encourage you, dear reader, to send us email anytime).\n When we say no, we try to do it quickly and clearly. We try to\ngive an explanation, although we don’t attempt to argue or debate\nour reason. We are sure that many of the things we say no to will\nget funded, and some will become incredibly successful companies.\nThat’s okay with us; even if we say no, we are still rooting for you.\n However, if we say no, please don’t respond and ask us to refer you\nto someone. You don’t really want us to do this, even if you don’t realize it. By referring you to someone else, at some level we are implicitly\nendorsing you. At the same time, we just told you that we are not\ninterested in exploring funding your deal. These two constructs are\nin confl ict with each other. The person we refer you to will immediately ask us if we are interested in funding your deal. We are now\nin the weird position of implicitly endorsing you on one side, while\nrejecting you on the other. This isn’t necessarily comfortable for us,\nand it’s useless to you, as the likelihood of the person we have just\nreferred you to taking you seriously is very low. In fact, you’d probably\nhave a better shot at it if we weren’t in the mix in the fi rst place!\nthe entrepreneur’s perspective\n There’s one exception to it not being suitable to ask for a referral. If you have a\nrelationship with the VC (e.g., it’s not a cold request), ask why the answer is no.\nIf the response to that question is something about the VC \u001f rm rather than your\ncompany (e.g., “You’re too small for us,” or “One of our portfolio companies\nis too competitive”), then you may ask for a referral to another \u001f rm that might\nbe a better \u001f t. However, be respectful here—if the VC doesn’t want to make a\nreferral, don’t push it.\nwww.itdf.ir\n168 Venture Deals\nSomewhere in a parallel universe, someone trained a bunch of\nus (probably Networking 101 or at a Zig Ziglar seminar) to always\n“ask for something” when you hear a “no” (e.g., keep the conversation going, get a referral, or try a different question). However, there\nare cases where this isn’t useful—to you.\nDon’t Be a Solo Founder\nOutside of some isolated examples, most entrepreneurs will have\nlittle chance of raising money unless they have a team. A team can\nbe a team of two, but the solo entrepreneur raising money can be a\nred flag.\nFirst, no single person can do everything. We’ve never met anyone who can do absolutely everything from product vision to executing on a plan, engineering development, marketing, sales, operations, and all the other random stuff starting a company entails.\nThere are just too many mission-critical tasks in getting a successful\ncompany launched. You will be much happier if you have a partner\nto back you up.\nSecond, it’s not a good sign if you can’t get others excited about\nyour plan. It’s hard enough to get VCs to write checks to fund your\ncompany; if you can’t find other team members with the same passion and beliefs that you have, this is a warning sign to anyone who\nmight want to fund your company.\nFinally, if you don’t have a team, what is the VC investing in?\nOften, the team executing the idea is more important than the idea\nitself. Most VCs will tell you that they’ve made money on grade B\nideas with grade A teams but that many A ideas were left in the dustbin due to a substandard team.\nThe one exception would be a repeat entrepreneur. If the venture fund has had a good experience with an entrepreneur before\nand believes they can build a solid team post funding, then the person has a chance to get funded as a solo entrepreneur.\nDon’t Overemphasize atents\nDon’t rely on patents. We see a lot of entrepreneurs basically hinge\ntheir entire company’s worth on their patent strategy. If you are in\nbiotech, hardware, or medical devices, this might be entirely appropriate.

This is especially true when\nyou factor in the different stages that your company will evolve\nthrough over its lifetime. While this book is primarily focused on\nearly-stage financings, and many of the issues apply to all stages,\nthere are some key differences. This chapter touches on a few of the\nimportant ones.\nSeed Deals\nWhile seed deals have the lowest legal costs and usually involve the\nleast contentious negotiations, they often allow for the most potential mistakes. Given how important precedent is in future financings,\nif you reach a bad outcome on a specific term, you might be stuck\nwith it for the life of your company. Ironically, we’ve seen more cases\nwhere the entrepreneur got what at the time seemed to be too good\nof a deal but ultimately ended up being bad for them.\nWhat’s wrong with getting great terms? If you can’t back them\nup with performance when you raise your next round, you may find\nyourself in a difficult position with your original investor. For example, assume you are successful getting a valuation that is significantly\nahead of where your business currently is. If your next round isn’t\nat a higher valuation, you are going to be diluting your original\nshareholders—the investors who took a big risk to fund you during\nthe seed stage. Either you’ll have to make them whole or, worse,\nthey’ll vote to block the new financing. This is especially true in cases\nVenture Deals: Be Smarter than Your Lawyer\nand Venture Capitalist, Third Edition\nBy Brad Feld and Jason Mendelson\nCopyright © 2016 by Brad Feld and Jason Mendelson\nwww.itdf.ir\n172 Venture Deals\nwith unsophisticated seed investors who were expecting that, no\nmatter what, the next round price would be higher.\nThe number and type of investors you get involved in your early\nrounds may also have a long-term impact on this. Assume that you\nare raising a $1 million seed financing and that you’ve been successful creating interest in your company. You have several offers—one\nfrom a venture capitalist (VC) willing to invest $750,000 alongside\nan AngelList syndicate that has committed the remaining $250,000.\nThe second is from five different venture capital firms, including two\nvery large ones, each of whom has committed to invest 20% of the\nround. Which is likely better for you long term?\nIn our experience, the first deal is the better one. In this situation, you have a clear lead investor who will be committed to your\ncompany and work hard for you. You also have some additional\nangels, ideally including some well-networked and high-profile ones\nwho can help you. In the second scenario, which is often called a\nparty round, you don’t have a clear lead investor. Instead, each of the\nVCs has, in their mind, bought an option on your next financing.\nIn the worst case, no one really pays much attention to you until\nyou have spent most of the $1 million, at which point they evaluate\nwhether or not you’ve made progress as they consider investing in\nthe next round. Think of this as a complicated version of doubles\ntennis where the shot from your opponent goes right down the middle of the court while you and your partner each shout out “yours.”\narly Stage\nAs with seed deals, precedent is important in early-stage deals. In our\nexperience, the terms you get in your first VC-led round will carry\nover to all future financings. One item that can haunt you forever is\nthe liquidation preference. While it may not seem like a big deal to\nagree to a participating preferred feature given that most early-stage\nrounds aren’t large dollar amounts, if you plan to raise larger rounds\none day, these participation features can drastically reduce return\ncharacteristics for the common stockholders.\nAnother term to pay extra attention to at the early stage is the\nprotective provisions. You will want to try to collapse the protective\nprovisions so that all preferred stockholders, regardless of series, vote\ntogether on them. If by your second round of financing you have two\nseparate votes, one by each class, for the protective provisions, you\nwww.itdf.ir\nIssues at Different Financing Stages 173\nare most likely stuck with a structure that will give each series of stock\na separate vote and thus separate blocking rights. This can be a real\npain to manage when you have multiple lead investors in multiple\nrounds that each have their own motivations to deal with.\n This dynamic is infl uenced by the number of different rounds\nyou expect to raise. If you are likely to raise only two or three rounds,\nthe synchronization between rounds is less important. But if you\nexpect you will raise more than three rounds, getting as many of the\nterms aligned across all classes of preferred will make your life a lot\nsimpler, and better, since you won’t have endless multiparty negotiations around every action that impact your preferred stockholders.\nRecognize, however, that many entrepreneurs are overly optimistic\nabout how many funding rounds they will need.\n Mid and Late Stages\n In your later rounds, board composition and voting control starts to\ncome into play in a signifi cant way. The voting control issues in the\nearly-stage deals are amplifi ed as you wrestle with how to keep control of your board when each lead investor per round wants a board\nseat. Either you can increase your board size to seven, nine, or more\npeople (which usually effectively kills a well-functioning board) or,\nmore likely, the board will be dominated by investors. If your investors are well behaved, this might not be a problem, but you’ll still be\nserving a lot of food at board meetings.\n There isn’t necessarily a good answer here. Unless you have massive negotiating power in a super-hot company, you are likely to give\na board seat to each lead investor in each round. If you raise subsequent rounds, unless you’ve worked hard to manage this early, your\nboard will likely expand and in many cases the founders will lose\ncontrol of the board.\nthe entrepreneur’s perspective\n There are ways to mitigate issues of board and voting control, such as placing\na cap (early on) on the number or percentage of directors who can be VCs as\nopposed to independent directors, preemptively offering observer rights to any\ndirector who is dethroned, or establishing an executive committee of the board\nthat can meet whenever and wherever you’d like without everyone else around\nthe table.\nwww.itdf.ir\n174 Venture Deals\nValuation also starts to be a confounding factor in later-stage\nrounds. While the natural instinct of any entrepreneur is to maximize valuation at each financing stage, the trade-off of a clean deal\nwith a lower valuation against a complicated deal, with excessive control and economic characteristics (referred to as structure), can often\nmake what seems like a great deal for the entrepreneur at the time\nbecome a nightmare in the future.\nMuch like issues that we’ve seen in seed deals, there have been\nsome deals that have been too good and have forced the VCs to hold\nout for a huge exit price. The net effect was that by raising money at\nsuch a high valuation, the entrepreneurs forfeited the ability to sell\nthe company at a price they would have been happy with, because\nof the inherent valuation-creation desires of the VCs who paid such\na high price. We’ve seen deal terms that specifically either forbid\nsales below a certain value or provide for a guaranteed multiple on\na VC’s investment that juices up the latest round investors return at\nthe expense of the earlier investors, founders, and employees. The\nfascination with unicorns in the past few years has exacerbated this, as\nsophisticated investors demand more structure, resulting in significant outcome misalignment between early- and late-stage investors.\nAs we mentioned earlier in the book, when you get a term sheet from\nan early-stage VC, it is almost always the case that they have full approval\nof their firm to move forward with the investment. This is not necessarily the case with later-stage investors, as they often have at least one more\napproval step, which often happens after the entire deal has been negotiated. We’ve seen multiple situations where this final approval didn’t\nhappen, and the deal died at the very end of the process.\n In this case, you sign the term sheet, shut down discussions with all\nof the other investors you are talking to since you have signed a term\nsheet with a no-shop clause, and start down the process of diligence with\nyour prospective investor. Along the way, they inform you that they’ll\nneed approval from their investment committee and for some reason it\ndoesn’t happen. At this point you are stuck. You terminated your other\ninvestment options and now don’t have a valid term sheet any more.\nSometimes the investor will attempt to renegotiate the price or\nother terms knowing that they have all the leverage. We personally\nfind this deplorable, and it was one of the motivations for us to raise\nour Foundry Select fund, as we were tired of later-stage firms playing\ngames like this and wanted to be able to support our companies in\ntheir later stages.\nwww.itdf.ir\n175\n14C h a p t e r\nLetters of Intent—he Other erm Sheet\nhere is another type of term sheet that is important in an entrepreneur’s life—the letter of intent (LOI). Hopefully, one day you’ll\nreceive one from a potential acquirer that will lead to fame, riches,\nand happiness. Or at least you’ll get a new business card on heavier\ncard stock.\nTypically, the first formal step by a company that wants to acquire\nyours is for it to issue a letter of intent. This sometimes delightful\nand usually nonbinding document (except for things like a noshop agreement) is also known as an indication of interest (IOI),\nmemorandum of understanding (MOU), and even occasionally a\nterm sheet.\nAs with our friend the term sheet, there are some terms that\nmatter a lot and others that don’t. Once again there are plenty of\nmysterious words that experienced deal makers always know how\nand where to sprinkle so that they can later say, “But X implies Y,”\noften resulting in much arguing between lawyers. We’ve had LOIs\nget done in a couple of hours and had others take several months\nto get signed. As with any negotiation, experience, knowledge, and\nunderstanding matter. The LOI negotiation is usually a first taste of\nthe actual negotiating style you will experience from the other party.\nThis negotiation will be the beginning of the end of your independence as a company. Unlike a venture financing where everyone\ncan win by expanding the pie over time, you are now negotiating for\na fixed pie. Subsequently, the tone and stress around these negotiations are much tougher than a regular venture financing.\nVenture Deals: Be Smarter than Your Lawyer\nand Venture Capitalist, Third Edition\nBy Brad Feld and Jason Mendelson\nCopyright © 2016 by Brad Feld and Jason Mendelson\nwww.itdf.ir\n176 Venture Deals\nTo keep things straightforward, we are going to focus on explaining the typical case of a two-party transaction between a buyer and\na seller, which we’ll refer to as an acquisition. As with many things in\nlife, there are often more complex transactions, including three or\nmore parties, but we’ll save that for a different book.\nBy the time the buyer presents the seller with an LOI, there have\nbeen meetings, discussions, dinners, expensive bottles of wine, lots\nof conference calls, and an occasional argument. However, the buyer\nand the seller are still courting so they tend to be on their best behavior. The LOI is typically the first real negotiation and the true icebreaker for the relationship.\nIn ancient times, when the first LOI was presented, someone\ncrafted an introductory paragraph that started with something like\nthe following:\nDear CEO of Seller:\nWe have greatly enjoyed our conversations to date and are honored to present you with this letter of intent to acquire [Seller’s\nCompany]. We look forward to entering into serious discussions\nover the next several months and reaching an agreement to\nacquire your company. We’d like to thank you for entertaining\nour proposal, which follows:\nWhile every company has its own style, most LOIs begin with\nsome variation of this boilerplate paragraph. Of course, you’ll find—\nlater in the LOI—a qualifier that states that almost everything in the\nLOI is nonbinding, including the appearance of civility as part of the\nnegotiation.\nStructure of a Deal\nAs with financings, there are only a couple of things that really\nmatter—in this case price and structure. Since the first question\nanyone involved in a deal typically asks is “What is the price?,” we’ll\nstart there.\nUnlike a venture financing in which price is usually pretty\nstraightforward to understand, figuring out the price in an acquisition can be more difficult. There is usually some number floated in\nearly discussions, but this isn’t really the actual price since there are a\nlot of factors that can (and generally will) impact the final price of a\nwww.itdf.ir\nLetters of Intent—he Other erm Sheet 177\ndeal by the time the negotiations are finished and the deal is closed.\nIt’s usually a safe bet to assume that the easy-to-read number on the\nfirst page of the LOI is the best-case scenario purchase price. Following is an example of what you might see in a typical LOI:\nPurchase Price/Consideration: $100 million of cash will be paid\nat closing, $15 million of which will be subject to the terms of\nthe escrow provisions described in paragraph 3 of this Letter\nof Intent. Working capital of at least $1 million shall be delivered at closing. Forty million dollars of cash will be subject to\nan earn-out and $10 million of cash will be part of a management retention pool. Buyer will not assume outstanding options\nto purchase Company Common Stock, and any options to purchase shares of Company Common Stock not exercised prior\nto the Closing will be terminated as of the Closing. Warrants to\npurchase shares of Company capital stock not exercised prior to\nthe Closing will be terminated as of the Closing.\nBefore this paragraph was drafted, it’s likely that a number\naround $150 million was discussed as the purchase price. The first\nthing that jumps out is the reference to a $15 million escrow. The\nescrow (also known as a holdback) is money that the buyer is going\nto hang on to for some period of time to satisfy any issues that come\nup post financing that are not disclosed in the purchase agreement.\nIn some LOIs we’ve seen extensive details, wherein each provision\nof the escrow is spelled out, including the percentage of the holdback, length of time, and carve-outs to the indemnity agreement.\nIn other cases, there is mention that “standard escrow and indemnity terms shall apply.” We’ll discuss specific escrow language later\n(i.e., you’ll have to wait until “paragraph 3”), but it’s safe to say two\nthings: first, there is no such thing as standard language; and second, whatever the escrow arrangement is, it will decrease the actual\npurchase price should any claim be brought under it. So, clearly,\nthe amount and terms of the escrow and indemnity provisions are\nvery important.\nNext is the reference to $1 million of working capital. While\nthis might not seem like a big number, it’s still $1 million. Many\nyoung companies end up with negative working capital at closing\n(working capital is current assets minus current liabilities) due to\ndebt, deferred revenue, warranty reserves, inventory carry costs,\nwww.itdf.ir\n178 Venture Deals\nand expenses and fees associated with the deal. As a result, these\nworking capital adjustments directly decrease the purchase price if\nupon closing (or other predetermined date after the closing) the\nseller’s working capital is less than an agreed-upon amount. Assume\nthat unless the working capital threshold is a slam-dunk situation\nwhere the company has clearly complied with this requirement, the\ndetermination will be a battle that can have a real impact on the\npurchase price. In some cases, this can act in the seller’s favor to\nincrease the value of the deal if the seller has more working capital\non the balance sheet than the buyer requires, but only if the clause\naround working capital is bidirectional (it’s not in this example).\nFinally, it feels silly and gratuitous to us when a multibillion-dollar\ncompany asks for any working capital number above zero from\na startup.\nWhile earn-outs sound like a mechanism to increase price, in\nour experience, they usually are a tool that allows the acquirer to\nunderpay at time of closing and pay full value only if certain hurdles are met in the future. In our example, the acquirer suggested\nthat it was willing to pay $150 million, but is really paying only\n$100 million with $40 million of the deal subject to an earn-out.\nWe’ll cover earn-outs separately since there are a lot of permutations, especially if the seller is receiving stock instead of cash as its\nconsideration.\nIn our example, the buyer has explicitly carved out $10 million\nfor a management retention pool. This has become common since\nbuyers want to make sure that management has a clear and direct\nfuture financial incentive. In this case, it’s built into the purchase\nprice (e.g., $150 million). We’ve found that buyers tend to be split\nbetween building it into the purchase price and putting it on top\nof the purchase price. In either case, it is effectively part of the\ndeal consideration but is at risk since it’ll typically be paid out over\nseveral years to the members of management who continue their\nroles at the acquirer. If someone leaves, that portion of the management retention pool tends to vanish into the same place socks\nlost in the dryer go. In addition, it’s a move on the part of the buyer\nto allocate some percentage of the purchase price away from the\nformal ownership (or capitalization table) of the company as a way\nof driving an early negotiating wedge between management and\nthe investors.\nwww.itdf.ir\nLetters of Intent—the Other term Sheet 179\n Finally, there are a bunch of words in our example about the buyer\nnot assuming stock options and warrants. We’ll explain this in more\ndetail later, but, like the working capital clause, it can impact the overall value of the deal based on what people are expecting to receive.\n asset Deal versus Stock Deal\n While price is usually the fi rst issue on every seller’s mind, structure\nshould be second. Lawyers talk about two types of deals, asset deals\nand stock deals, but there are numerous structural issues surrounding each type of deal. Let’s begin by discussing the basics of an asset\ndeal and a stock deal.\n In general, all sellers want to do stock deals and all buyers want\nto do asset deals. Just to increase the confusion level, a stock deal\ncan be done for cash and an asset deal can be done for stock. Don’t\nconfuse the type of deal with the actual consideration received.\n Sarcastic VCs on the seller side will refer to an asset deal as a\nsituation “when buying a company is not really buying a company.”\nBuyers will request this structure, with the idea that they will buy only\nthe particular assets that they want out of a company, leave certain\nliabilities (read: “warts”) behind, and live happily ever after. If you\nengage lawyers and accountants in this discussion, they’ll ramble on\nabout something regarding taxes, accounting, and liabilities, but our\nexperience is that most of the time the acquirer is just looking to\nbuy the crown jewels, explicitly limit its liabilities, and craft a simpler\ndeal for itself at the expense of the seller. We notice that asset deals\nare more popular in shaky economic times since acquirers are trying to avoid creditor issues and successor liability. One saw relatively\nfew asset deals in the late 1990s, but in early 2000 asset deals became\nthe entrepreneur’s perspective\n By the time someone is offering you a lot of money to buy your company, you\nshould have good counsel or advisers or independent board members to help\nyou navigate the terms. The structure of the deal is very important. You should\nbe willing to stand behind your representations and warrantees with a reasonable 12- to 18-month escrow at a minimum. If you can’t, you look like you’re\nhiding something. Management retention pool, working capital, and earn-outs\nare just negotiation points around the certainty and price of a deal.\nwww.itdf.ir\n180 Venture Deals\nmuch more popular; yet by 2016 asset deals are once again rarely\nseen and only in distressed situations.\nWhile asset deals can work for a seller, the fundamental problem\nfor the seller is that the company hasn’t actually been sold! The assets\nhave left the company (and are now owned by the buyer), but there\nis still a shell corporation with contracts, liabilities, potential employees, and tax forms to file. Even if the company is relatively clean from\na corporate hygiene perspective, it may take several years (depending on tax, capital structure, and jurisdictional concerns) to wind\ndown the company. During this time, the officers and directors of\nthe company are still on the hook, and the company presumably has\nfew assets to operate the business (since they were sold to the buyer).\nIn the case of a stock deal, the acquirer is buying the entire company. Once the acquisition is closed, the seller’s company disappears\ninto the corporate structure of the buyer and there is nothing left,\nexcept possibly some T-shirts that found their way into the hands\nof spouses and the company sign that used to be on the door just\nbefore the deal closed. There is nothing to wind down, and the company is history.\nSo is an asset deal bad or is it just a hassle? It depends. It can be\nreally bad if the seller has multiple subsidiaries, numerous contracts,\nemployees with severance commitments, or disgruntled shareholders,\nor it is close to insolvency. In this case, the officers and directors may\nbe taking on fraudulent conveyance liability by consummating an asset\ndeal. It’s merely a hassle if the company is in relatively good shape, is\nvery small, or has few shareholders to consider. Of course, if any of\nthese things are true, then the obvious rhetorical question is, “Why\ndoesn’t the acquirer just buy the whole company via a stock deal?”\nIn our experience, we see stock deals the vast majority of the\ntime. Often, the first draft of the LOI is an asset deal, but it’s often\nthe first point raised by sophisticated sellers and they are often successful in ending up with a stock deal except in extreme circumstances when the company is in dire straits. Many buyers go down a\npath to discuss all the protection they get from an asset deal. This is\ngenerally nonsense since a stock deal can be configured to provide\nfunctionally equivalent protection for the buyer with a lot less hassle\nfor the seller. In addition, asset deals are no longer the protection\nthey used to be with regard to successor liability in a transaction,\nsince courts are much more eager to find a company that purchases\nsubstantial assets of another company to be a so-called successor in\ninterest with respect to liabilities of the seller.\nwww.itdf.ir\nLetters of Intent—the Other term Sheet 181\n Form of Consideration\n Imagine the following conversation between an entrepreneur and\na VC:\nEntrepreneur: “I just received an offer for the company for $15 million from Company X.”\nVC: “Awesome. Who’s Company X? I’ve never heard of them.”\nEntrepreneur: “It’s a private company funded by Venture Firm Y.”\n VC: “Cool—$15 million. Is it a cash deal?”\n Entrepreneur: “No, it’s all stock.”\n VC: “Hmmm—are you getting preferred or common stock?”\n Entrepreneur: “Common stock. Why?”\n VC: “How much money has the company raised?”\n Entrepreneur: “$110 million.”\n VC: “What’s the liquidation preference? Is it a participating preferred? What’s the valuation of the company?”\n Entrepreneur: “Oh, I’m not worried about that stuff. The valuation\nis $300 million and they say they are going public soon.”\n If you paid attention to the fi rst part of this book, you know where\nthis is going. The entrepreneur just received an offer for his company\nthe entrepreneur’s perspective\n If your company is in bad shape, you will probably have no choice but to do an\nasset sale and deal with the liabilities and associated winding down of the entity\nyourself. You should be prepared for this situation and constantly be calculating\nthe expense and hassle of an asset deal to understand what kind of alternatives\nyou’re willing to consider.\n The structure of the deal is also tied closely to the tax issues\nsurrounding a deal. Once you start trying to optimize for structure\nand taxes, you end up defi ning the type of consideration (stock or\ncash) the seller can receive. It can get complicated very quickly,\nand pretty soon you can feel like you are climbing up a staircase\nin an Escher drawing. We’ll dig into tax and consideration in a bit;\njust realize that they are all linked together and usually ultimately\nimpact price, which is—after all—what the seller usually cares most\nabout.\nwww.itdf.ir\n182 Venture Deals\nfor 5% of the acquirer (actually 4.76% on a post-transaction basis) in\nan illiquid stock in a private company that is sitting under $110 million\nof liquidation preferences (and more than that if the preference is\nparticipating). If our friend calls his friendly neighborhood financial\nappraiser to do a valuation analysis, he’ll find out the $15 million he\nthinks he is getting is actually valued at a lot less (probably good for\ntax purposes, not so good for buying beer, sports cars, and second\nhouses).\nThe form of consideration matters a lot. Cash is—well—king.\nEverything else is something less. And it can be a lot less. Did you hear\nthe one where the acquirer offered “free software products” up to a\ncertain amount in exchange for the company’s assets? Gee, er, thanks.\nObviously, cash is easy to understand and to value. Stock can be\nmore complicated. If it’s stock in a private company, understanding\nthe existing capital structure is a critical first step to understanding\nwhat you are getting. If it’s stock in a public company, you’ll want\nto ask a variety of questions, including whether the stock is freely\ntradable, registered, or subject to a lockup agreement. If it’s freely\ntradable, will you be considered an insider after the transaction and\nhave any selling restrictions? If it’s not freely tradable, what kind of\nregistration rights will you have? It can get messy quickly, especially if\nyou try to optimize for tax (there’s that tax thing again).\nIt’s important to realize that the value of your company and the\nprice you are getting paid may not be the same. Don’t let yourself get\nlocked into a price early in the negotiation until you understand the\nform of consideration you are receiving.\nssumption of Stock Options\nAfter considering price and structure, it is time to discuss other\nmajor deal points generally found in an LOI. One item to note here:\nabsence of these terms in your particular LOI may not be a good\nthing, as in our experience detailed LOIs are better than vague ones\n(but be careful not to overlawyer the LOI). Specifically, this is the\ncase because during the LOI discussions most of the negotiating is\nbetween the business principals of the deal, not their lawyers, who\nwill become the main deal drivers after the signing of the term sheet.\nOur experience is that leaving material business points to the lawyers will slow down the process, increase deal costs, and cause much\nunneeded pain and angst. Our suggestion would be to always have\nwww.itdf.ir\nLetters of Intent—he Other erm Sheet 183\nmost of the key terms clearly spelled out in the LOI and agreed to\nby the business principals before the lawyers bring out their clubs,\nquivers, and broadswords.\nThe way stock options are handled (regardless of how you\naddress the 409A issues, which we’ll discuss later) can vary greatly\nin the LOI. Over the past five years, the practice of what happens to\nstock options in a merger has changed greatly. Let’s start by discussing some history.\nPrior to 2010 nearly all well-drafted option plans provided for\nautomatic assumption of the plan. If a company was acquired, the\nplan would automatically be assigned to and assumed by the acquirer;\notherwise, all the unvested options would immediately vest and the\nemployees would cash out immediately. This approach provided an\nincentive to all parties to have the options assumed. Since nothing is\nfree in this world, the costs to assume the plan (not the legal costs,\nbut the total consideration owed to employees under the plan) was\nnetted against the purchase price. Simply stated, if the assumed plan\nconverted to options of the acquirer worth $10 million, then $10 million would come off the purchase price.\nThe theory behind this approach was to protect the employees\nof the company who are not at the bargaining table during an acquisition. In the last decade, acquirers began to substitute forms of consideration they viewed as comparable rather than simply assuming\nthe option plan. Instead of options, they might create a cash-backed\nincentive plan for employees. Or, they’d choose restricted stock\nunits (RSUs) instead of options because of arcane tax laws that force\ncompanies to expense options. Regardless, acquirers wanted flexibility to incentivize their new employees rather than being forced\ninto a specific approach.\nIn some cases, acquirers did not assume the plan, sometimes\ndue to tax laws, and all of the employee’s options vested. While\nthat sounds employee friendly (it is), it can cause significant friction among employees. For instance, consider an employee who had\nbeen at the company for three years and was mostly vested. This\nemployee saw relatively little vesting (one year) in contrast to the\nemployee who joined the company a month earlier and now got\nthree years and 11 months of vesting.\nAs time passed, the option plans evolved. Today, the general\napproach is that options plans allow for the assumption or substitution of similar plans, but explicitly state that the acquirer has no\nwww.itdf.ir\n184 Venture Deals\nobligation to do much at all. The board of the acquired company\ncan vote to accelerate the options if it chooses, but are no longer\nguaranteed protections for employees with stock options. Usually,\nthis doesn’t matter, as the parties (both the target and the buyer,\nalong with their respective boards of directors) do the right thing by\nemployees. But this is not always the case.\nWe’ve seen situations where the buyer refused to assume the option\nplan or provide any meaningful substitute consideration. In this case,\nthe employees with options get hosed and those who are vested get all\nthe consideration. In these cases, the acquirer only cares about technology, the management team, and long-serving employees.\nWe’ve seen other cases where the acquirer offered to either\nassume or substitute (again with RSUs) the option plan, but then\nasked key members of the team to “revest” their options. Revesting\nmeans that even if an employee has vested a certain amount of their\noptions, they have to stick around for a predetermined period of\ntime to vest them again. For example, presume that the acquirer\nwants everyone to revest all of their options over two years. It doesn’t\nmatter how many options you’ve already vested—you now start the\nvesting clock over. Typically, the acquirer will do something more\ncomplicated, like give everyone vesting credit for up to two years\nbut then revest any remaining options over four years. This costs the\nacquirer nothing but has a meaningful impact on potential consideration for employees that is dependent on how long they stay.\nAnother issue impacting stock options is whether the acquisition is\nin cash, public company stock, or private company stock. We’re going\nto ignore tax considerations for the moment (although you shouldn’t\nignore them in a real-world acquisition). If I’m an employee of a seller,\nI’m going to value cash differently from public stock (restricted or\nunrestricted) and public stock options differently from private stock\n(or options). If the buyer is public or is paying cash, the calculation\nis straightforward and can be easily explained to the employee. If the\nbuyer is private, this becomes much more challenging and is something that management and the representatives of the seller who are\nstructuring the transaction should think through carefully.\nThe basis of stock options (also known as the strike price or barter\nelement)—and who pays for it—should also be considered as it\nreduces the value of the stock options. Specifically, if the value of\na share of stock in a transaction is $1 and the basis of the stock\noption is $0.40, the actual value of the stock option at the time of\nwww.itdf.ir\nLetters of Intent—the Other term Sheet 185\nthe transaction is $0.60. Many sellers forget to try to recapture the\nvalue of the barter element in the purchase price and allow the total\npurchase price to be the gross value of the stock options (vested and\nunvested) rather than getting incremental credit on the purchase\nprice for the barter element.\n Let’s assume you have a $100 million cash transaction with $10\nmillion going to option holders, 50% of which are vested and 50% are\nunvested. Assume for simplicity that the buyer is assuming unvested\noptions but including them in the total purchase price (the $100 million) and that the total barter element of the vested stock is $1 million\nand the barter element of the unvested stock is $3 million. The vested\nstock has a value of $4 million ($5 million value minus $1 million\nbarter element) and the unvested stock has a value of $2 million ($5\nmillion value minus $3 million barter element). So the option holders\nare going to net only $6 million total. Often, the seller will catch the\nvested stock amount (e.g., vested options will account for $4 million\nof the $100 million), but the full $5 million will be allocated to the\nunvested options (instead of the actual value/cost to the buyer of $2\nmillion). This is a material difference (e.g., the difference between\n$91 million going to the non–option holders versus $94 million).\n Of course, all of this assumes that the stock options are in the\nmoney. If the purchase price of the transaction puts the options out\nof the money (e.g., the purchase price is below the liquidation preference), all of this is irrelevant since the options are worthless.\n While this is dense stuff, it’s important to address it during the\nLOI phase to make sure you are doing the right thing in the context\nof the deal for both your employees and your investors. It’s easy to\npunt this until later in the process, only to fi nd that you are now\nstuck in the middle of a multiparty negotiation between the buyer,\nyour investors, and your employees with no obvious way to satisfy\neveryone. Also, by this time you’ve stopped negotiations with other\nsuitors and have no real negotiation leverage.\nthe entrepreneur’s perspective\n In most cases, your employees got your company to where it is. Do not sell them\nshort in an exit, whether or not there is an earn-out that compels you to keep\nthem happy. Your reputation as an entrepreneur is at stake here, plus you want\nto do the right thing.\nwww.itdf.ir\n186 Venture Deals\nepresentations, Warranties, and Indemnification\nEvery LOI will have some mention of representations and warranties,\nalso called “reps and warranties” or just “reps” by those in the know.\nThe reps and warranties are the facts and assurances about the business that one party gives the other. In most LOIs, the language in\nthis paragraph is light in substance, but this section can have a profound effect on the deal and consume a ridiculous amount of legal\ntime during the negotiation of the definitive agreement.\nThe first thing to note is who is making the representations.\nDoes it say the selling company will be making the reps, or does it\nsay the selling company and its shareholders are on the hook? Or,\nmore typically, is it silent as to who exactly is stepping up to the plate?\nGiven that many shareholders (including VCs and individuals who\nhold stock in the selling company) are unwilling or unable to represent and warrant to the seller’s situation, it’s important to resolve in\nthe LOI who is actually making the reps. Optimally you can get this\nsolved before the lawyers start fighting over this, since most buyers\nwill eventually accept that the company, instead of the underlying\nshareholders in the company, is making the reps.\nAll LOIs will have something regarding indemnification in the\nevent that one of the reps or warranties is breached. Considering\nhow important this provision is to the seller in an acquisition, it’s\noften the case that the buyer will try to sneak past the following language in the LOI.\nThe Company shall make standard representations and warranties and provide standard indemnification to Acquirer.\nThis is code for:\nWe are really going to negotiate hard on the indemnification\nterms, but don’t want to tell you at this stage so that you’ll sign\nthe LOI and become committed to doing the deal. Really—trust\nus—our deal guys and lawyers are nice and cuddly.\nDepending on the situation of the seller (perhaps the seller is in\na position whereby it wants to get the buyer committed more than\nvice versa and is willing to take its chances with the lawyers arguing),\nwe’d suggest that you at least sketch out what the indemnification\nwww.itdf.ir\nLetters of Intent—the Other term Sheet 187\nescrow\n The escrow is another hotly negotiated term that often is left ambiguous in the LOI. The escrow (also known as a holdback) is money\nthat the buyer is going to hang on to for some period of time to satisfy any issue that comes up post acquisition that is not disclosed in\nthe purchase agreement.\n In some LOIs we’ve seen extensive details—with each provision\nof the escrow agreement spelled out—including the percentage\nof the holdbacks, length of time, and carve-outs to the indemnity\nagreement. In other cases, there is simply a declaration that “standard escrow and indemnity terms shall apply.” Since there really isn’t\nany such thing as a standard term, this is another buyer-centric trap\nfor deferring what can become a brutal negotiation in the post-LOI\nstage. Whatever the escrow arrangement is, it will decrease the actual\npurchase price should any claim be brought under it, so the terms of\nthe agreement can be very important since they directly impact the\nvalue that the seller receives.\nthe entrepreneur’s perspective\n As long as most of your reps and warranties are quali\u001f ed by a phrase like “to\nthe extent currently known . . . ,” you should have no problem signing them.\nArguing against them is a big red \u001e ag to investors or buyers.\nwill look like. Again, once the lawyers get involved, arguments like\n“It’s market and it’s nonnegotiable” or “I get this on all of my deals”\nget bantered about endlessly.\n The buyer usually makes some reps as well, but since it is paying\nfor the seller, these are typically pretty lightweight unless the buyer is\npaying in private company stock. If you are a seller and you are getting private stock from the buyer, a completely logical starting point\nis to make all the reps and warranties reciprocal.\n While many of these reps and warranties may look similar to the\nones in your venture fi nancing documents, VCs almost never sue\ncompanies they invest in. However, in acquisitions the reps and warranties often come into play after the merger is completed, so you\nshould understand them and take them seriously.\nwww.itdf.ir\n188 Venture Deals\n The carve-outs to the escrow caps typically include fraud, capitalization, and taxes. Often, especially due to the risk of attack by\npatent trolls, a buyer will press for intellectual property ownership to\nbe carved out. We’ve also started to see liabilities resulting from lack\nof 409A compliance be carved out in escrow agreements under the\nargument that 409A is equivalent to taxes. In all cases, the maximum\nof the carve-out should be the aggregate deal value, as the seller\nshouldn’t have to come up with more than it was paid in the deal to\nsatisfy an escrow claim.\n A lot of buyers will say something like “Well, I can’t fi gure the\nspecifi cs out until I do more due diligence.” We say baloney to that\nas we’ve yet to meet a buyer that was unable to put an initial escrow\nproposal, with some detail and caps defi ned, in the LOI. This language is still subject to due diligence but is harder to retrade after it\nhas been agreed to since something of substance has to emerge for\nthere to be a legitimate discussion about it.\n Finally, the form of consideration of the escrow is important. In\na cash deal, it’s easy—it’s cash. However, in a stock deal or a deal that\nhas a combination of cash and stock, the value of the escrow will\nthe entrepreneur’s perspective\n Buyers overreaching on the escrow terms are silly, especially if you have a\nwell-run business with audited \u001f nancials and outside directors. Remember,\nwhen a public company gets acquired, its reps and warranties usually expire\nat the closing!\n In our experience over hundreds of acquisitions, an escrow is\ntypically set up as the sole remedy for breaches of the reps and\nwarranties, with a few exceptions, known as carve-outs. Normally\nbetween 10% and 20% of the aggregate purchase price is set aside\nfor between 12 and 24 months to cure any breaches of the reps.\nWhile this is usually where the escrow terms end up (and are usually described as the escrow caps ), it can take a herculean effort to\nget there. Buyers often try to overreach, especially if the parameters\nare not defi ned in the LOI, by asking for things such as uncapped\nindemnity if anything goes wrong, personal liability of company\nexecutives and major shareholders, and even the ability to capture\nmore value than the deal is worth.\nwww.itdf.ir\nLetters of Intent—he Other erm Sheet 189\nfloat with the stock price, and the value can vary even more dramatically over time if it’s private company stock. There are lots of permutations on how to best manage this on the seller side; you should be\nespecially thoughtful about this if you have concerns that the buyer’s\nstock is particularly volatile. Imagine the situation where the stock\nprice declines but the buyer’s escrow claims are of greater value than\nthe stock in escrow represents. Reasonable people should be able to\nagree that the seller doesn’t have to come up with extra money to\nsatisfy the claims.\nConfidentiality/Nondisclosure greement\nWhile VCs will almost never sign nondisclosure agreements (NDAs)\nin the context of an investment, NDAs are almost always mandatory\nin an acquisition. If the deal falls apart and ultimately doesn’t happen, both parties (the seller and the buyer) are left in a position\nwhere they have sensitive information regarding the other. Furthermore, it’s typically one of the few legally binding provisions in an\nLOI other than the location of jurisdiction for any legal issues and\nbreakup fees. If the deal closes, this provision largely becomes irrelevant since the buyer now owns the seller.\nBoth the buyer and the seller should be aligned in their desire\nto have a comprehensive and strong confidentiality agreement\nsince both parties benefit. If you are presented with a weak (or onesided) confidentiality agreement, it could mean that the acquirer is\nattempting to learn about your company through the due diligence\nprocess and may or may not be intent on closing the deal.\nGenerally, a one-sided confidentiality agreement makes no\nsense—this should be a term that both sides are willing to sign up to\nwith the same standard. Public companies are often very particular\nabout the form of the confidentiality agreement. While we don’t recommend sellers sign just anything, if it’s bidirectional you are probably in a pretty safe position.\nmployee Matters\nAlthough the board of a company has a fiduciary responsibility to\nall employees and shareholders of a company, it’s unfortunately not\nalways the case that management and the board are looking out\nfor all employees and all shareholders in an acquisition. In public\ncompany acquisitions you often hear about egregious cases of senior\nwww.itdf.ir\n190 Venture Deals\nmanagement looking out for themselves (and their board members\nhelping them line their pockets) at the expense of shareholders.\nThis can also happen in acquisitions of private companies, where\nthe buyer knows it needs the senior executives to stick around and\nis willing to pay something extra for it. Of course, the opposite can\nhappen as well, where the consideration in an acquisition is slim and\nthe investors try to grab all the nickels for themselves, leaving management with little or nothing.\nIt’s important for management and the board to have the proper\nperspective on their individual circumstances in the context of the\nspecific deal that is occurring. Whenever we are on the board of\na company that is a seller, we prefer to defer the detailed discussion about individual compensation until after the LOI is signed\nand the managements of the buyer and the seller have time to do\ndue diligence on each other, build a working relationship, and\nunderstand the logical roles of everyone going forward. Spending\ntoo much time up front negotiating management packages often\nresults in a lot of very early deal fatigue, typically makes buyers\nuncomfortable with the motivation of the management team for\nthe sale, and can often create a huge wedge between management\nand the other shareholders on the seller’s side. We aren’t suggesting that management and employees shouldn’t be taken care of\nappropriately in a transaction; rather, we believe there won’t be\nan opportunity to take care of everyone appropriately if you don’t\nactually get to the transaction. Overnegotiating this too early often\ncauses a lot of unnecessary stress, especially between management\nand their investors.\nWhile we don’t recommend negotiating the employment agreements too early in the process, we also don’t recommend leaving\nthem to the very end of the process. Many buyers do this so they can\nexert as much pressure as possible on the key employees of the seller\nas everyone is ready to get the deal done, and the only thing hanging\nit up is the employment agreements. Ironically, many sellers view the\nsituation exactly the opposite way (i.e., now that the deal is basically\ndone, we can ask for a bunch of extra stuff from the buyer). Neither\nof these positions is very effective, and both usually result in unnecessary tension at the end of the deal process and occasionally create\na real rift between buyer and seller post transaction.\nThis is a particular situation where balance is important. When\nit comes to employee matters, there’s nothing wrong with a solid\nwww.itdf.ir\nLetters of Intent—the Other term Sheet 191\nnegotiation. Just make sure that it happens in the context of a deal\nor you may never actually get the deal done.\n Conditions to Close\n Buyers normally include certain conditions to closing in the LOI.\nThese can be generic phrases such as “Subject to Board approval by\nAcquirer,” “Subject to the Company not having a material adverse\nchange,” or “Subject to due diligence and agreement on defi nitive\ndocuments.” There can also be phrases that are specifi c to the situation of the seller such as “Subject to the Company settling outstanding copyright litigation,” or “Subject to Company liquidating\nits foreign subsidiaries.” We generally don’t get too concerned about\nthis provision, because any of these deal outs are very easy to trigger\nshould the buyer decide that it doesn’t want to do the deal.\n Instead of worrying about whether the provision is part of the\nLOI, we tend to focus on the details of the conditions to close since\nthis is another data point about the attitude of the buyer. If the list\nof conditions is long and complex, you likely have a suitor with very\nparticular tastes. In this case it’s worth pushing back early on a few of\nthese conditions to close, especially the more constraining ones, to\nlearn about what your negotiation process is going to be like.\nthe entrepreneur’s perspective\n Remember, once buyers are in a signi\u001f cant legal and due diligence process\nwith you, they are as emotionally and \u001f nancially committed to a deal as you are\n(and in many cases, their reputation is on the line, too).\n As the seller, you should expect that once you’ve agreed to specifi c conditions to close, you will be held to them. It’s worth addressing these early in the due diligence process so you don’t get hung up\nby something unexpected when you have to liquidate a foreign subsidiary or some other bizarre condition to close, especially if you’ve\nnever done this before.\n the No-Shop Clause\n Signing a letter of intent starts a serious and expensive process for\nboth the buyer and the seller. As a result, you should expect that a\nbuyer will insist on a no-shop provision similar to the one that we\nwww.itdf.ir\n192 Venture Deals\ndiscussed around term sheets. In the case of an acquisition, no-shop\nprovisions are almost always unilateral, especially if you are dealing\nwith an acquisitive buyer.\n As the seller you should be able to negotiate the length of time\ninto a reasonable zone such as 45 to 60 days. If the buyer is asking\nfor more than 60 days, you should push back hard since it’s never in\na seller’s interest to be locked up for an extended period of time. In\naddition, most deals should be able to be closed within 60 days from\nsigning of the LOI, so having a reasonable deadline forces everyone\nto be focused on the actual goal of closing the deal.\n Since most no-shop agreements will be unilateral, the buyer will\ntypically have the right but not the obligation to cancel the no-shop\nif it decides not to go forward with the deal. As a result, the time window is particularly important since the seller is likely to be tied up for\nthe length of the no-shop even if the deal doesn’t proceed. In some\ncases an honorable buyer who has decided not to move forward with\na deal will quickly agree to terminate the no-shop; however, it’s more\nlikely that the buyer will simply drag its feet until the no-shop expires.\n In cases in which the deal is actively in process and the no-shop\nperiod ends, the seller should expect a call from the buyer a few\ndays before the expiration of the no-shop with a request to extend\nit. There is often some additional leverage that accrues to the seller\nat this moment in time, including relief from a net worth threshold,\npotential short-term fi nancing from the buyer, or even very specifi c\nconcessions around reps and warranties that have been held up in\nthe negotiation. The seller should be careful not to overreach at this\nmoment since the tone for the fi nal phase of the negotiation can be\nset by the behavior around the extension of the no-shop. If the seller\nasks for too much at this point in time, it can expect the buyer to\ntighten down on everything else through the close of the deal.\n Rather than fi ght the no-shop, we’ve found it more effective\nto limit the duration of the no-shop period and carve out specifi c\nevents, most notably fi nancings (at the minimum fi nancings done by\nthe existing syndicate), to keep some pressure on the buyer.\nthe entrepreneur’s perspective\n As with no-shops with VCs, no-shops with potential buyers should also have an\nautomatic out if the buyer terminates the process.\nwww.itdf.ir\nLetters of Intent—the Other term Sheet 193\n Fees, Fees, and More Fees\n The LOI will usually be explicit about who pays for which costs and\nwhat limits exist for the seller to run up transaction costs in the\nacquisition. Transaction costs associated with an agent or a banker,\nthe legal bill, and any other seller-side costs are typically included in\nthe transaction fee section. Though it’s conceivable that the buyer\nwill punt on worrying about who covers transaction fees, most savvy\nbuyers are very focused on making sure the seller ends up eating\nthese, especially if they are meaningful amounts.\n Occasionally, the concept of a breakup fee comes up for situations where the deal doesn’t close or the seller ends up doing a\ndeal with another buyer. Breakup fees are rare in private company\nVC-backed deals but prevalent in deals where one public company\nacquires another public company. We generally resist any request of\na buyer to institute a breakup fee and tell the potential buyer to rely\non the no-shop clause instead. Most buyers of VC-backed companies\nare much larger and more resource rich than the seller it seeks to\nacquire, so it strikes us as odd that the buyer would receive a cash\nwindfall if the deal does not close, especially since both parties will\nhave costs incurred in the process. When we are the seller, we rarely\nask for a breakup fee.\nthe entrepreneur’s perspective\n There are some rare circumstances in which a seller can reasonably ask for\na breakup fee. If the buyer is competitive and the seller is concerned that the\nbuyer may be entering the process as a \u001f shing expedition as opposed to a\ngood-faith effort to buy the company, or if the seller incurs a massive amount\nof customer or employee risk by entering into the deal, a breakup fee may\nbe appropriate.\nregistration rights\n When a public company is buying a private company for stock, it’s\nimportant for the seller to understand the registration characteristics and rights associated with the stock it will be receiving. Some\nbuyers will try to ignore this; a good seller should work hard up front\nto get agreement on what it will be receiving. Just because a company\nis public doesn’t mean all of their stock is tradable on a stock market.\nwww.itdf.ir\n194 Venture Deals\nIf you are receiving stock in an acquisition, you’ll often receive unregistered stock that will need to be registered before you can sell it.\nIf the buyer offers unregistered stock, it should come with a\npromise to register the shares. It’s important that the seller recognize that this is almost always a nonbinding promise since the buyer\ncan’t guarantee when it can register the shares because it is dependent on the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for this and\nit doesn’t control the SEC. The past history of the buyer with the\nSEC is crucial, including knowing the current status of SEC filings,\nany outstanding registration statements, and any promises that the\nbuyer has made to shareholders of other companies it has acquired.\nWe’ve experienced several cases in which buyers promised a\nquick registration only to drag their feet on the filing after the deal\nor have the filing get hung up at the SEC. In today’s regulatory environment, we’ve been amazed by the poor behavior of several of the\nlarge accounting firms when they state they don’t have time to work\non acquisition accounting questioned by the SEC, especially in situations in which the accounting firm is not going to be working with\nthe acquirer after the acquisition.\nPursuant to securities laws, if you receive unregistered stock and\nhold it for a year, then you can sell it on the stock market on which\nthe company is listed. A year, however, can be a long time and involve\na lot of volatility, especially in a thinly traded stock. Make sure you\nare getting what you think you are getting.\nShareholder epresentatives\nAcquisitions are not actually finished when the deal closes and the\nmoney trades hands. There are terms such as managing the escrow,\ndealing with earn-outs, working capital adjustments, and even litigation concerning reps and warranties that will last long into the future.\nIn every acquisition, there is someone—referred to as the shareholder\nrepresentative—who is appointed to be the representative of all the\nformer shareholders in the seller to deal with these issues.\nThis lucky person, who is generally not paid anything for his services, gets to deal with all the issues that arise between the buyer and\nthe seller after the transaction. These issues can be based around\nbuyer’s remorse or be legitimate issues, and are often time consuming and expensive to deal with, and impact the ultimate financial\noutcome of the deal.\nwww.itdf.ir\nLetters of Intent—he Other erm Sheet 195\nTraditionally, either an executive from the seller or one of the\nVC board members takes on this role. If nothing ever comes up, it’s a\ncomplete nonevent for this person. However, when something goes\nawry where the buyer makes a claim on the escrow or threatens to\nsue the former shareholders of the company, this job often becomes\na giant time-wasting nightmare. The shareholder rep, who typically\nhas a full-time job, limited money from the deal (often tied up in the\nescrow) to hire professionals to help her, and usually isn’t a subject\nmatter expert in anything that is at issue, ends up being responsible\nfor dealing with it. If it’s an executive of the seller, she might still be\nworking for the buyer. In any case, this person is now making decisions that impact all of the shareholders and subsequently ends up\nspending time and energy communicating with them. Finally, some\nbuyers, in an effort to exert even more pressure on the system, sue\nthe shareholder reps directly.\nWe’ve each been shareholder reps many times. Several years ago,\nwe decided never to be shareholder reps again, as we see no upside\nin taking on this responsibility.\nIf you somehow end up being the shareholder rep, make sure\nyou negotiate a pool of money into the merger agreement that you\ncan dip into to hire professionals to support you should something\narise that you have to deal with. We often see a separate escrow that is\nused exclusively to pay for the expenses of the shareholder representative. If nothing else, this works to be a good shield to a bad-acting\nbuyer since it will see that you have money to hire lawyers to yell at\nits lawyers.\nNever ask someone who will be working for the buyer post\ntransaction to be the shareholder rep. If you do this, you are asking this person to get into a winner-takes-all fight against his current\nemployer, and that is not a happy position for anyone to be in. The\nonly time this ever works is if the shareholder rep has a role that is\ncritical to the buyer where the threat of the rep quitting will help\ninfluence the outcome in a way positive to the seller. Regardless, this\nis a stressful and uncomfortable position to be in.\nYou should also be wary of letting a VC take on this role. Escrow\nand litigation dynamics are time sensitive, and we’ve had experiences where other VCs involved as the shareholder rep paid little or\nno attention to their responsibilities since they didn’t fully understand or appreciate the legal dynamics surrounding their role.\nWe’ve had some bizarre experiences, including a shareholder rep\nwww.itdf.ir\n196 Venture Deals\nwho was a VC (a co-investor in a deal with us) who blew an escrow\nsituation by ignoring the notice he received from the buyer that\na claim had been breached. The notice period was 30 days, and\n31 days after receiving the notice, the VC received another letter\nsaying the escrow had been deducted by the amount of the claim.\nFortunately, we had a good relationship with the lawyer on the side\nof the buyer and were able to get an exception made, but the buyer\nhad no obligation to do this other than as a result of goodwill that\nexisted between the parties.\nAs a result of our experience with this over the years, Jason cofounded a company called SRS Acquiom (www.srsacquiom.com),\nwhich is an organization that acts as a shareholder rep. The cost, relative to the overall value of the deal, of using a firm like SRS is modest and you get professionals who spend 100% of their time playing\nthe role of shareholder rep. When there is litigation, they get sued\nand deal with all of the details. Given the wide range of deals they’ve\nworked on as shareholder reps, they tend to have wide-ranging and\nextensive experience with both buyers and their lawyers.\nwww.itdf.ir\n197\n15C h a p t e r\nWhy Do erm Sheets ven xist?\nOne question that we often get is “why does the term sheet even\nexist?” In fact, why do we need all of this legal paperwork in the\nfirst place? Since a careful reader will point out that we have said\nthat it is rare a venture capitalist (VC) would sue one of its portfolio\ncompanies on reps and warranties, why can’t we do all of this with\na handshake or a simple document? Given that there are only a few\nthings that really matter, why have all of this ponderous structure\nand legalese?\nIt turns out nothing requires that you use a term sheet. Our\nfavorite negotiations with entrepreneurs have been ones where\nwe’ve literally shaken hands and agreed on valuation, board structure, and option pool size verbally or over email. From there, we\njust used our standard forms that we publish on the Foundry Group\nwebsite (http://foundrygroup.com/resources) and were done with\nthe deal in a few weeks. We find this spirit of collaboration and trust\nattractive as it starts the working relationship off on the right foot.\nThe irony that we prefer doing deals without a term sheet is not lost\non us.\nWhile this approach works if you are a sophisticated founder,\nhave worked with us before, or are working with attorneys who know\nus well, this is the exception case. Usually, the term sheet will be the\nfirst real negotiated document in a relationship.\nRegardless of whether a term sheet is drafted or not, a plethora\nof legal documents will need to be created. This is just a fact of life.\nVCs need to answer to their investors who would not be comfortable\nVenture Deals: Be Smarter than Your Lawyer\nand Venture Capitalist, Third Edition\nBy Brad Feld and Jason Mendelson\nCopyright © 2016 by Brad Feld and Jason Mendelson\nwww.itdf.ir\n198 Venture Deals\nif we didn’t have legal documents to protect their investment. Our\nauditors would have nothing to look at to ensure we are getting what\nwe paid for and are valuing our portfolio correctly. Furthermore,\nthere are a few extreme cases out there where these documents were\nimportant constraints to bad behavior. Typically, courts will not give\nVCs any benefit of the doubt in contract negotiations so if we want a\nprovision, we have to get it clearly and explicitly in writing.\nAlong these lines, we thought it might be helpful to give you\nthe theories of why contracts like these exist. Properly drafted documents should help the parties align incentives so that each desires\nto act in ways that are beneficial to one another. Following are some\ngeneral themes of what makes a contract truly useful in a relationship and should serve as a framework when you consider particular\nprovisions in a contract. Once again, we thank our friend Brad\nBernthal (CU Law Professor) for his suggestions.\nConstraining Behavior and the lignment of Incentives\nAny good contractual relationship strives to be a win/win situation\nfor both parties, where each party is incentivized to act in each\nother’s best interests. Many things can drive this. It could be the\nbusiness relationship is so important to both parties that everyone will be a good actor. There can be reputational constraints\ninvolved. However, neither of these have any legal teeth to make\nsure everyone behaves. So contracts were developed to make sure\nthat if something went awry, good behavior, to some extent, would\nbe enforceable.\nWhile it’s nice to think that people are generous of spirt, it’s a fact\nof life that most people, especially in a business context, are driven\nby self-interest. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, but it’s helpful to\nalways keep this in mind. If you assume that your VC will do what is\nbest for both of you and it happens that these actions actually make\nyou both better off, then the relationship should be a smooth one. If\none day you awaken and realize that you are not on the same page,\nthen things can get interesting. For instance, remember the section\nin the previous chapter around the treatment of stock options in an\nacquisition. In this situation, there are numerous ways that you, your\nVCs, and your employees will have radically different self-interests.\nWhat benefits one group will directly adversely affect the others.\nOr consider the situation of a capped liquidation preference with\nwww.itdf.ir\nWhy Do erm Sheets ven xist? 199\nparticipation. Again, at the time of a sale of the business, the parties\nmay not be aligned.\nWe always suggest that you deal with things like this openly and\ndirectly. Ultimately, if you can’t reach an agreement on how to address\nthem, the situation will be bounded by the contractual terms that\nyou have agreed to beforehand. Because of this, it is critical to think\nabout how term sheets and contracts constrain bad behavior and align\nincentives.\nAs we’ve discussed, the only two things that really matter in a\nterm sheet are economic and control provisions. We could have\nsaid that the only two things that matter are making sure incentives\nwere aligned and that potential bad behavior is mitigated, but that\nwould be too academic for real life. However, keep in mind that the\nconstructs are analogous. Whenever you are trying to figure out if a\nparticular term is good or bad for you, consider how this will either\nproactively or negatively (through veto powers) decrease the ability\nfor people to behave poorly, or whether or not they improve the\nalignment of your incentives as well as your investors’. If something\nfeels out of whack and you think a particular provision divides you\nand your investor’s incentives, be very careful about accepting it. It’s\nin this vein that you have a very powerful negotiating tool. You don’t\nhave to say “I don’t want this term, it’s not market.” Instead, try the\napproach of “Wait a minute, this term starts the relationship by dividing us and resulting in our incentives being misaligned.”\nOutside of these two considerations, every good contract should\ndeal effectively with transactions costs, agency costs, and information\nasymmetries, which we’ll discuss below.\nransaction Costs\nThere are different definitions of transaction costs, but for our purposes they are the costs—in both time and money—associated with\ncreating a relationship between two parties. For instance, in closing\na venture deal between an entrepreneur and a VC, transaction costs\nwill include not only the costs of lawyers for both sides but also the\ncosts of meetings, the time involved to do due diligence upon one\nanother, and every step of the process from that first meeting to the\nsigned definitive documents.\nIf you go back 25 years, it was difficult to get your startup funded,\nnot just because there were fewer VCs, but because there were high\nwww.itdf.ir\n200 Venture Deals\ntransaction costs to deal with. There were no standard forms of documents accepted by the industry, so lawyers spent a lot of time arguing\nabout things. There was no ubiquity of electronic communications.\nThis meant meetings were in-person meetings and hard to schedule.\nThere was no instant communication method. Furthermore, couriers shuffled documents back and forth (Jason’s old law firm had bike,\ncar, and plane couriers staffed full time at the office). Thankfully,\ntechnology, transparency, and discussion online and in books like\nthis have dramatically lowered these costs. The dynamics of a financing is no longer a black box controlled by lawyers and a few knowledgeable investors.\nWhen entering a contractual relationship, consider that all good\ncontracts minimize current and future transaction costs. As we discussed earlier, convertible debt became increasing popular due\nto the lower legal fees associated with it when compared to equity\nrounds. Fifteen years ago an equity financing cost four times that of\na convertible debt financing. Today, there isn’t much difference at\nall. When determining what structure to use to raise money for your\ncompany, consider what the transaction costs will be to get the deal\ndone.\nWe find future transaction costs to be even more important\nto consider. For instance, we suggest that you negotiate a detailed\nmerger letter of intent (LOI) before signing it in order to avoid\ntoo much negotiation ambiguity while drafting the definitive\ndocuments. As you have more negotiating power during the LOI\nstage, what would take two hours to negotiate now could save you\ntens of hours later. In short, you are defining the relationship up\nfront so that you don’t have to run up huge costs, both in time and\nmoney, figuring out who has which rights and who receives what\nconsideration.\ngency Costs and Information symmetry\nAgency costs are costs associated with an agent acting on behalf of\na principal. Some of these costs are direct. If I hire a stockbroker to\nbuy stocks for me, I must also pay them a fee to complete the trade.\nSome of these costs are indirect and hard to spot.\nLet’s use the example of a walking dead portfolio company. This is a\ncompany that is still in business, but just limping along with no clear\nwww.itdf.ir\nWhy Do erm Sheets ven xist? 201\npath to an outcome. It would probably be in the VC’s best interest if\nthe company shut down so the VC could recoup whatever money is\nleft in the bank account and take the tax loss.\nLet’s consider the VC the principal in the scenario. The CEO,\nhowever, has other incentives. He still has a decent salary and gets\nto walk around town with his CEO business card. His incentive is to\nkeep the company alive as long as possible. The CEO in this case is\nthe agent.\nRegardless of the amount of time the VC and the entrepreneur\nspends together, there is no way either party will know as much about\nthe other’s business—and motivation—as they know about their\nown. This information asymmetry, like agency dynamics, results in a\nmisalignment of incentives.\nConsider which contractual provisions could help alleviate\nthis conflict. A contractual right to a board seat for the VC would\nbe helpful. An odd number of board members, with at least one\nindependent board member, would be relevant. The VC having\nredemption rights, while not necessarily palatable to the CEO, provides some additional pressure in the context of making a decision\nabout what to do. The idea of a liquidation preference, occasionally\nreferred to as schmuck insurance, is additional protection for the\ninvestor.\neputation Constraints\nIf you are playing a long-term game, reputation constraints can be even\nmore important than a specific term in a contract. The venture industry is small and reputation matters a lot. Bad behavior gets talked\nabout, even if it’s done quietly and not out in the open. The smaller\nthe ecosystem, the more this phenomenon exists, so as you focus on\nsmaller geographies, the importance of reputation increases.\nWhile there are some people who care less about their reputation\nthan others, your reputation will be established over a long period\nof time. While no contract is airtight, how you deal with ambiguity\nand conflict will help define your reputation. This impacts both\nentrepreneurs and investors. Do your homework and find out the\nreal reputation of the other party that you are dealing with. In some\nregards, this is the most important term of them all.\nwww.itdf.ir\n203\n16Chapter\nLegal hings very ntrepreneur\nShould Know\nhere are a few legal issues that we’ve seen consistently become\nhurdles for entrepreneurs and their lawyers. While in some cases\nthey will simply be a hassle to clean up in a financing or an exit,\nthey often have meaningful financial implications for the company\nand, in the worst case, can seriously damage the value of your business. We aren’t your lawyers or giving you legal advice here (our\nlawyers made us write that), but we encourage you to understand\nthese issues rather than just assume that your lawyer got them right.\nIf you want to read the best book ever written on legal issues that\nface entrepreneurs, get the book The Entrepreneur’s Guide to Business\nLaw, Fourth Edition, by Constance Bagley and Craig Dauchy (SouthWestern, 2012). It is written for entrepreneurs, not lawyers, so it’s easily\ndigestible and is the best legal resource we know for entrepreneurs.\nIntellectual roperty\nIntellectual property (IP) issues can kill a startup before you even\nreally begin. Following is an example.\nYou and a friend go out and get some beers. You start telling him\nabout your new company that will revolutionize X and make you a\nlot of money. You spend several hours talking about the business\nmodel, what you need to build, and the product requirements. After\none beer too many, you both stumble home happy.\nVenture Deals: Be Smarter than Your Lawyer\nand Venture Capitalist, Third Edition\nBy Brad Feld and Jason Mendelson\nCopyright © 2016 by Brad Feld and Jason Mendelson\nwww.itdf.ir\n204 Venture Deals\nYour friend goes back to work at his job at Company X-like. You\npicked this particular friend to vet your idea because you know that\nyour company is similar to some cutting-edge work he does at X-like.\nThere is even a chance that you’d want to hire this friend one day.\nYou spend the next six months bootstrapping your company and\nrelease a first version of your product. A popular tech blog writes\nabout it and you start getting inbound calls from venture capitalists\n(VCs) wanting to fund you. You can’t stop smiling and are excited\nabout how glorious life as an entrepreneur is.\nThe next day, your beer buddy calls and says that he’s been laid\noff from Company X-like and wants to join your company. You tell\nhim as soon as you get funding you’d love to hire him. Your friend\nsays, “That’s okay—I can start today for no pay since I own 50% of\nthe company.” You sit in stunned silence for a few seconds.\nAs you discuss the issue, your friend tells you that he owns 50%\nof the IP of your company since you guys went out and basically\nformed the company over beers. You tell him that you disagree\nand he doesn’t own any of the company. He tells you his uncle is\na lawyer.\nAs strange as this sounds, this is a real example. While we think\nthe claim by your so-called friend is ridiculous, if he takes action\n(via his uncle, who is likely working for him for free), he can slow\ndown your VC financing. If he stays after you and you don’t give him\nsomething, it’s possible that he’ll end up completely stifling your\nchance to raise money. If you happen to get lucky (for instance, if\nyour so-called friend accidentally gets hit by a bus), you still have the\noutstanding issue that Company X-like may also have a claim on the\nIP if there is an actual lawsuit filed and X-like happens to stumble\nupon piecing the story together.\nThere are endless stories like this in startup land, including the\nhistory of the founding of Facebook, popularized (and fictionalized)\nby the movie The Social Network. Our example is one extreme, but\nthere are others, like students starting a company in an MBA class\nwhere two go on to actually start the business while the other two\ndon’t, but terrorize the company for ownership rights later due to\ntheir claimed IP contributions. Or the entrepreneur who hired a\ncontractor to write code for him, paid the contractor, but still ended\nup in litigation with the contractor, who claimed he owned IP above\nand beyond what he was paid for. Realize that even if you pay for\ncode written by someone else, you don’t own the code unless you get\nwww.itdf.ir\nLegal hings very ntrepreneur Should Know 205\nwhoever wrote the code to sign a document saying that the code was\n“work for hire.” Those exact words are critical.\nWhen things like this come up, even the most battle-hardened\nVC will pause and make sure that there are no real IP issues involved.\nResponsible VCs who want to invest in your company will work with\nyou to solve this stuff, especially when absurd claims like the examples we just gave are being made. In our experience, there’s often a\nstraightforward resolution except in extreme circumstances.\nThe key is being careful, diligent, and reasonably paranoid up\nfront. When friends are involved, you can usually work this stuff out\nwith a simple conversation. However, when talking to random people, be careful of unscrupulous characters, especially those you know\nnothing about.\nSome entrepreneurs, and many lawyers, think the right solution\nis to carefully guard your idea or have everyone you talk to sign a\nnondisclosure agreement (NDA). We don’t agree with this position.\nInstead, we encourage entrepreneurs to be very open with their\nideas, and we generally believe NDAs aren’t worth very much. However, be conscious of whom you are talking to. If there are few reputational constraints to someone acting badly, then think hard before\ndisclosing your IP to them. If you do start heading down the path\nof actually creating a business, make sure you have competent legal\ncounsel help you document it.\nmployment Issues\nThe most common lawsuits entrepreneurs face are ones around\nemployment issues. These are never pleasant, especially in the context of an employee you’ve recently fired, but they are an unfortunate result of today’s work context.\nThere are a few things you can do to protect against this. First,\nmake sure that everyone you hire is an at-will employee. Without\nthese specific words in the offer letter, you can end up dealing with\nstate employment laws (which vary from state to state) that determine whether you can fire someone. We’ve encountered some challenging situations in certain states in the United States that made\nfiring almost as challenging as firing them in parts of Europe.\nNext, consider whether you want to prebake severance terms\ninto an offer letter. For instance, you might decide that if you let\nsomeone go, they will receive additional vesting or cash compensation.\nwww.itdf.ir\n206 Venture Deals\nIf you don’t decide this at the outset, you may be left with a situation\nwhere you are able to fire someone, but they claim that you owe\nthem something on the way out. However, determining up-front severance is about as much fun as negotiating a prenuptial agreement,\nand the downside to it is that it limits your flexibility, especially if the\ncompany is in a difficult financial situation and needs to fire people\nto lower its burn rate in order to conserve cash to survive.\nEvery entrepreneur should know at least one good employment\nlawyer. Dealing with these particular issues can be stressful and unpredictable, especially given the extensive rules around discrimination\nthat again vary from state to state, and a knowledgeable employment\nlawyer can quickly help you get to an appropriate resolution when\nsomething comes up.\nState of Incorporation\nWhile you can incorporate your business in 50 states, there are a\nfew preferred states to incorporate in, especially when you are planning to seek VC backing. Most VCs prefer one of three states: Delaware, whichever state the company is in, or whichever state the VC\nis located in.\nDelaware is common because corporate law for Delaware is\nwell defined and generally business friendly, and most lawyers in\nthe United States are adept at dealing with Delaware law. If you are\nplanning on ultimately having an initial public offering (IPO), most\ninvestment bankers will insist on your being incorporated in Delaware before they will take you public. More importantly, lots of obvious things that are difficult or not permitted in some states, such as\nfaxed signature pages or rapid response to requests for changes in\ncorporate documents, are standard activities in Delaware.\nThe only two disadvantages of being incorporated in Delaware\nare that you will have to pay some extra (but very modest) taxes and\npotentially comply with two sets of corporate laws. For instance, if\nyou are located in California and are a Delaware corporation, you’ll\nhave to comply with Delaware law and some of California law, too,\ndespite being a Delaware corporation.\nEither of the other two common choices, the location of the\ncompany or the location of the VC, is generally fine also. However, if\na VC has no experience with your state’s corporate laws, you’ll occasionally find resistance for incorporating in your state. We view this\nwww.itdf.ir\nLegal hings very ntrepreneur Should Know 207\nas rational behavior on the part of the VC, especially when the VC\njoins the board because the VC then ends up being personally liable\nas a director under the state’s corporate laws. Since these laws can\nvary widely, we always encourage Delaware as the default case.\nype of Corporate Structure\nThere are three different corporate structures you can use for your\ncompany: a C Corp, S Corp, or an LLC. If you are going to raise\nventure capital, you will want to be a C Corp, but it’s useful to understand why and when you might benefit from the other corporation\nstructures.\n If you are not going to raise any VC or angel money, an S Corp\nis the best structure as it has all the tax benefits and flexibility of a\npartnership—specifically a single tax structure versus the potential\nfor the double tax structure of a C Corp—while retaining the liability\nprotection of a C Corp.\nOften, an LLC (limited liability company) will substitute for\nan S Corp (it has similar dynamics), although it’s much harder to\neffectively grant equity to employees. Instead of stock options, LLCs\nuse membership units, which few employees have experience with.\nIn addition, stock options have better and more clearly defined tax\ndynamics. LLCs work well for companies with a limited number of\nowners. They don’t work as well when the ownership starts to be\nspread among multiple people.\nIf you are going to raise VC or angel money, a C Corp is the best\n(and often required) structure. In a VC-/angel-backed company,\nyou’ll almost always end up with multiple classes of stock, which are\nnot permitted in an S Corp. Since a VC-/angel-backed company is\nexpected to lose money for a while (in most cases that’s the expectation for why you are raising money in the first place) the double taxation issues will be deferred. In addition, it’s unlikely that you will be\ndistributing money out of a VC-/angel-backed company when you\nbecome profitable.\nccredited Investors\nThough this isn’t a book about securities laws (which, if it were,\nwould make it a dreadfully dull book), much of it is actually about\nselling securities to investors. There are lots of laws that you need to\nwww.itdf.ir\n208 Venture Deals\ncomply with in order to not get in trouble with the Securities and\nExchange Commission (SEC), and thus that is one of the major reasons that you need to have a good lawyer.\nWhen we wrote the prior editions of this book, it was illegal to\nsell securities to anyone you wanted to. Now, in a crowdfunding/\npost–JOBS Act world, you have many more options to whom you can\nsell equities to. Nonetheless, the vast majority of entrepreneurs are\nstill sticking with the old regime of selling to accredited investors.\nThere are laws that effectively say that only rich and sophisticated\npeople are accredited investors allowed to buy stock in private companies. If you try to raise money from people who do not fit this definition, then you’ve probably committed a securities violation. This\nmeans you should not ask your hairdresser, auto mechanic, and bag\nboy at the grocery store to buy stock in your company unless they\nare independently wealthy. Normally, the SEC doesn’t catch most\npeople who do this, but it does happen sometimes.\nIf you ignore this advice and sell stock in your private company\nto people who don’t fit the SEC’s definition of an accredited investor, then you have a lifelong problem on your hands. Specifically,\nthese nonaccredited investors can force you to buy back their shares\nfor at least their purchase price anytime they want, despite how your\ncompany is doing. This right of rescission is a very real thing that we see\nfrom time to time. It is particularly embarrassing when the person\nforcing the buyback is a close family friend or relative who should\nnot have been offered the stock in the first place.\nFiling an 83(b) lection\nThis is another “if you don’t do it right in the beginning you can’t fix\nit later” issue. If you don’t file an 83(b) election within 30 days after\nreceiving your stock in a company, you will almost always lose capital\ngains treatment of your stock when you sell it. We refer to this as the\nmistake that will cause you to pay at least double the amount of taxes\nthat you should pay.\nThe 83(b) election is a simple form that takes two minutes to execute. Most lawyers will provide the standard form as part of granting\nyour stock. Some will even provide a stamped and addressed envelope, and the most client-friendly lawyers will even mail the form for\nyou. Or you can just Google “83(b) election” and download the form\nyourself. Note that you must send the form to the appropriate IRS\nservice center.\nwww.itdf.ir\nLegal hings very ntrepreneur Should Know 209\nIt’s a bummer when you are in the middle of an acquisition and\nyou realize the 83(b) election is unsigned under a pile of papers on\nyour desk. For a firsthand account of this, take a look at the chapter\ntitled “To 83(b) or Not to 83(b)” in Brad’s and David Cohen’s book\nDo More Faster (John Wiley & Sons, 2010).\nSection 409 Valuations\nOur last random legal topic that often rears its ugly head around an\nacquisition is Section 409A of the tax code, also known as the 409A\nvaluation. Section 409A says that all stock options given to employees\nof a company need to be at fair market value.\nIn the old days before the turn of the millennium (pre-409A),\nthe board of a private company could determine what the fair market value of a share of common stock was and this was acceptable\nto the IRS. It became common practice that the share price for the\ncommon stock, which is also the exercise price for the stock options\nbeing granted, was typically valued at 10% of the price of the last\nround of preferred stock. The exception was when a company was\nwithin 18 months of an IPO, in which case the price of the common\nstock converged with the price of the preferred stock as the IPO\ndrew nearer.\nFor some reason the IRS decided this wasn’t the right way to\ndetermine fair market value, came up with a new approach in Section 409A of the tax code, and created dramatic penalties for the\nincorrect valuation of stock options. The penalties included excise\ntaxes on the employee and potential company penalties. In addition,\nsome states, such as California, instituted their own penalties at the\nstate level. When Section 409A was first drafted, it sounded like a\nnightmare.\nHowever, the IRS gave everyone a way out, also known throughout the legal industry as a safe harbor. If a company used a professional valuation firm, the valuation would be assumed to be correct\nunless the IRS could prove otherwise, which is not an easy thing to\ndo. In contrast, if the company chose not to use a professional valuation firm, then the company would have to prove the valuation was\ncorrect, which is also a hard thing to do.\nThe predictable end result of this was the creation of an entirely\nnew line of business for accountants and a bunch of new valuation\nfirms. Section 409A effectively created new overhead for doing\nbusiness that helped support the accounting profession. Although\nwww.itdf.ir\n210 Venture Deals\nwe have a bunch of friends who work for 409A valuation firms, we\ndon’t believe that any of this is additive in any way to the company\nor to the value-creation process. Originally, these costs were about\n$5,000 to $15,000 per year. Recently, eShares announced that they’ll\ndo 409A valuations if a company signs up for a subscription fee as\nlittle as $25 per month depending on the size of the company. Either\nway, money spent here could easily be spent on something more useful to the company, such as beer or search engine marketing.\nAn unfortunate side effect is that the 10% rule, where common\nstock was typically valued at 10% of the preferred stock, is no longer\nvalid. We often see 409A valuations in early-stage companies valuing\ncommon stock at 20% to 30% of the preferred stock. As a result,\nemployees make less money in a liquidity event, as options are more\nexpensive to purchase since their basis (or exercise price) is higher.\nIronically, the IRS also collects fewer taxes, as it receives tax only\non the value of the gain (sale price of the stock minus the exercise\nprice). In this case, the accountants are the only financial winners.\nwww.itdf.ir\n237\nGlossary\naccelerator A program intended to mentor and accelerate the growth\nand success of a startup company.\naccredited investor As defined by federal securities laws, a person who is\npermitted to invest in startups and other high-risk private company securities based on the net worth and income level of the potential investor.\nacquisition A transaction between two companies where one is buying the\nother.\nadverse change redemption A type of redemption right whereby a\nshareholder gets the right to redeem her shares if something adverse\nhappens to the company.\nadviser Someone who advises startup companies.

In addition to\nthe nuts and bolts of the term sheet, we’ve covered the participants\nin the process, discussed how the fundraising process works, talked\nabout how venture capital firms operate, and described some basic\nnegotiating principles. We’ve also covered a bunch of dos and don’ts\naround the fundraising process and, as a bonus, added a chapter\ndeconstructing a typical letter of intent that you’d receive at the\nbeginning of the acquisition process.\nThough we are early-stage investors, we’ve tried to explain issues\nthat you’ll face in any round of financing. We’ve tried to be balanced\nbetween the entrepreneur’s view and the VC’s view, as we’ve been\nboth (although we’ve now been VCs for much longer). We’ve also\nincluded an entrepreneur’s perspective—from Matt Blumberg, the\nCEO of Return Path—throughout the book.\nWe know much of this material is dry, and we tried hard to spice\nit up with our own special brand of humor. We’ve reviewed it many\ntimes but know there are likely some mistakes, as is inevitable with\nsomething this complex and subjective. We learn the most from our\nmistakes and encourage you to email us at jason@foundrygroup.com\nor brad@foundrygroup.com with anything you find that is unclear\nor that you believe is incorrect.\nOf course, none of the information in this book should be construed as legal advice from us. We are not your lawyers—just a pair\nof guys who wrote a book that we hope is helpful to you. If you have\nlegal questions, ask your lawyers. Yes, our lawyers made us write this.\nWe hope this book has been helpful to you as you work to create\nan amazing new company.\nVenture Deals: Be Smarter than Your Lawyer\nand Venture Capitalist, Third Edition\nBy Brad Feld and Jason Mendelson\nCopyright © 2016 by Brad Feld and Jason Mendelson\nwww.itdf.ir\n213\nAppendix A: Sample Term Sheet \nACME VENTURE CAPITAL 2016, LP\nSummary of Terms for Proposed Private Placement of Series A Preferred Stock of NEWCO.COM\n, 20\n(Valid for acceptance until , 20 )\nIssuer: NEWCO.COM (the “Company”)\nInvestor(s): Acme Venture Capital 2011, L.P. and its affiliated partnerships\n(“Acme”) [and others, if applicable] (“Investors”).\nAmount of Financing: An aggregate of $ million, [(including $ from the\nconversion of outstanding bridge notes)] representing a % ownership\nposition on a fully diluted basis, including shares reserved for any\nemployee option pool.

Following are several important ones:\nAccelerators Accelerators modeled after Techstars (www\n.techstars.com) and Y Combinator (www.ycombinator\n.com) have emerged all over the world. These programs\ntypically invest a modest amount of money (around\n$20,000) in companies in exchange for a small amount\nof equity (typically 6%). In addition, some offer additional financing of $100,000 or more in the form of a\nconvertible note. The companies then go through a\n90-day, intensive, full-time program where they accelerate their startups via help from the accelerators, mentors,\nand the surrounding startup communities. Several years\nago, Techstars founded the Global Accelerator Network\n(www.gan.co) in an effort to link the best accelerators\nand provide a series of best practices across them.\nVentureDeals.com (www.venturedeals.com) This is the companion website for Venture Deals and is maintained by us.\nOn it we have a blog where we answer questions submitted via the website as well as highlight great blog posts\nby other VCs.

The two\nmost popular ones, AngelList (www.angel.co) and Gust\n(www.gust.com), have become very powerful resources for\nboth entrepreneurs and investors.\nProduct Crowdfunding Crowdfunding is a new form of financing that has been enabled by the Internet. Popular sites\nlike Kickstarter (www.kickstarter.com) and Indiegogo (www\n.indiegogo.com) have popularized the first phase of this,\nwhere companies can use crowd funding to raise money\nto build their products. In the current model, companies\nare effectively getting their customers to prepay for their\nproduct or service. In April 2012 in the United States, the\nJumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act was passed,\nwhich provides for equity crowdfunding, or the ability of a\ncompany to use the notion of crowdfunding to raise equity.\nDatabases A number of private company databases, including Mattermark (www.mattermark.com) and Crunchbase\n(www.crunchbase.com) exist. Keep in mind that with all\nprivate company data, accuracy varies a lot, so you’ll find\nsome noise here, but in general the signal is high. If you\ndon’t have a strong VC network, these databases can help\nyou identify the VCs who might be interested in your particular company.\nEducation There is an enormous amount of entrepreneurshiporiented educational resources on the Web.

At\nthe time, I didn’t know preferred stock from chicken stock and\nthought a right of first refusal was something that applied to the\nNFL waiver wire.\nToday, as the CEO of Twitter and the founder of three previous\ncompanies, the latter two acquired by public companies and the first\nacquired by a private company, I’ve learned many of the concepts\nand lessons in this book the hard way. While I had some great investors and advisers along the way, I still had to figure out all the tricks,\ntraps, and nuances on my own.\nMy partners in my first company—Burning Door Networked\nMedia—and I were novices, so we made a lot of mistakes, but we managed to sell the company in 1996 for enough money to keep ourselves\nknee-deep in Starbucks tall coffees every morning for a year.\nSeveral years later, my partners at Burning Door and I started a\nnew company called Spyonit. This company did better and was sold\nto a public company called 724 Solutions in September 2000. Our\nstock was tied up for a year (we weren’t that tuned into registration\nrights at the time) and when we got our hands on the stock in midSeptember 2001, the collapse of the Internet bubble and the financial aftermath of 9/11 had caused our stock to decline to the point\nthat it was worth enough money to keep us knee-deep in tall skim\nlattes at Starbucks every morning for a year.\nSo, like all good entrepreneurs, we tried again. This time, armed\nwith a lot more knowledge and humility, we started FeedBurner in\n2004. We raised several rounds of venture capital, including a seed\nround from DFJ Portage, a Series A round from Mobius Venture\nVenture Deals: Be Smarter than Your Lawyer\nand Venture Capitalist, Third Edition\nBy Brad Feld and Jason Mendelson\nCopyright © 2016 by Brad Feld and Jason Mendelson\nwww.itdf.ir\n236 Foreword to the First and Second Editions\nCapital (the firm Brad Feld and Jason Mendelson were part of at\nthe time) and Sutter Hill, and a Series B round from Union Square\nVentures. FeedBurner grew quickly, and before we knew it we had\nattracted acquisition interest from several companies, including\nGoogle, which purchased us in 2007 and allowed me to stop using\ncoffee-purchase analogies to quantify the payout.\nAfter spending several years at Google, I was recruited to join\nTwitter, where I now am the CEO. During my tenure with the company, Twitter has grown dramatically, from 50 people to more than\n430 people, and has completed two major rounds of financing, having raised over $250 million.\nWhen I reflect back on what I now know about VC deals, acquisitions, how VCs work, and how to negotiate, it’s very satisfying to\nsee how far I’ve come from that day back in the early 1990s when I\ncofounded Burning Door Networked Media. When I read through\nthis book, I kept thinking over and over, “Where were you when I\nstarted out?” as the knowledge contained between these covers\nwould have saved me a remarkable amount of time and money on\nmy journey.\nBrad and Jason have written a book that is hugely important for\nany aspiring entrepreneurs, students, and first-time entrepreneurs.\nBut it’s not just limited to them—as I read through it I found new\npearls of wisdom that even with all the experience I have today I can\nput to good use. And if you are a VC or aspire to be a VC, get in the\nfront of the line to read this to make sure you are armed with a full\nrange of understanding of the dynamics of your business.

Why do some places flourish with innovation while\nothers wither? What are the determinants that help a startup community\nachieve critical startup mass?

Why do startup communities\npersist, despite often having higher real estate costs and wages than other\nVenture Deals: Be Smarter than Your Lawyer\nand Venture Capitalist, Third Edition\nBy Brad Feld and Jason Mendelson\nCopyright © 2016 by Brad Feld and Jason Mendelson\nwww.itdf.ir\nSTARTUP COMMUNITIES\n264\nareas? At stake is nothing less than the continued economic vitality, and\neven the very existence of towns, cities, and regions.\nStudies show that the geography of innovation is neither democratic\nnor flat. This may be surprising since you might think that location should\nmatter less than ever in today’s society. Information can be quickly sent and\nreceived by anyone from almost anywhere. In theory, expanding access to\nresources and information from anywhere might decouple the relationship\nbetween place and innovation.\nEconomic geographers, however, observe the opposite effect. Evidence\nsuggests that location, rather than being irrelevant, is more important\nthan ever. Innovation tilts heavily toward certain locations and, as scholar\nRichard Florida (professor at Rotman School of Management, at the\nUniversity of Toronto and author of The Rise of the Creative Class (2002))\nsays, is “spiky” with great concentration of creative, innovative people in\ntightly clustered geographies. Location clearly matters.\nThree prominent frameworks explain why some locales are hotbeds\nof entrepreneurship whereas others are the innovation equivalent of\na twenty-first century economic mirage. Each explanation of regional\nentrepreneurial advantage comes from a different discipline—one from\neconomics, another from sociology, and a third from geography. These\nexplanations are, for the most part, nonexclusive and complementary.\nThe first explanation, external or agglomeration economies, comes from\neconomics. This line of analysis reaches back to the research of economist\nAlfred Marshall, and, in recent decades, Michael Porter, Paul Krugman, and\nPaul Romer have deepened this account. External economies focus on the\nbenefits of startup concentration in an area. This explanation focuses on economic concepts as they apply to location. One is that companies co-located\nin an area benefit from “external economies of scale.” Emerging companies\nneed certain common inputs—for example, infrastructure, specialized legal\nand accounting services, suppliers, labor pools with a specialized knowledge\nbase—that reside outside the company. Companies in a common geographic\narea share the fixed costs of these resources external to the company. As\nwww.itdf.ir\nPrinciples of a Vibrant Startup Community\n265\nmore and more startups in an area can share the costs of specialized inputs,\nthe average cost per startup drops for the specialized inputs. This provides\ndirect economic benefit to companies located within a startup community.\nAnother economic concept, network effects, explains why geographic\nconcentration yields further advantage. Network effects operate in systems\nwhere the addition of a member to a network enhances value for existing\nusers. The Internet, Facebook, and Twitter are examples in which network\neffects operate powerfully. These services may have some value to you if\nthere are just 100 other users. However, these networks are immensely\nmore useful if there are 100 million other users that you can connect with.\nStartup communities similarly feature strong network effects. For example,\nan area with 10 great programmers provides a valuable pool of labor talent\nfor a startup. However, an additional 1,000 amazing programmers in the\nsame area is vastly more valuable to startups, especially if programmers\nshare best practices with other programmers, inspire one another, or start\nnew companies. External economies of scale lower certain costs; meanwhile, network effects make co-location more valuable.\nThe second explanation of startup communities, horizontal networks,\ncomes from sociology. In her PhD work at MIT, AnnaLee Saxenian\n(currently Dean of the UC Berkeley School of Information) noticed that\nexternal economies do not fully explain the development and adaptation of startup communities. In particular, in her seminal book Regional\nAdvantage: Culture and Competition in Silicon Valley and Route 128 (1994)\nSaxenian noted that two hotbeds for high-tech activity—Silicon Valley\nand Boston’s Route 128—looked very similar in the mid-1980s. Each area\nenjoyed agglomeration economies associated with the nation’s two hightech regions. Yet just a decade later, Silicon Valley gained a dominant\nadvantage over Route 128. External economies alone did not provide an\nanswer. Saxenian set out to resolve the puzzle of why Silicon Valley far\noutpaced Route 128 from the mid-1980s to mid-1990s.\nSaxenian persuasively argues that a culture of openness and information\nexchange fueled Silicon Valley’s ascent over Route 128. This argument is tied\nwww.itdf.ir\nSTARTUP COMMUNITIES\n266\nto network effects, which are better leveraged by a community with a culture\nof information sharing across companies and industries. Saxenian observed\nthat the porous boundaries between Silicon Valley companies, such as Sun\nMicrosystems and HP, stood in stark contrast to the closed-loop and autarkic companies of Route 128, such as DEC and Apollo. More broadly, Silicon\nValley culture embraced a horizontal exchange of information across and\nbetween companies. Rapid technological disruption played perfectly to\nSilicon Valley’s culture of open information exchange and labor mobility.\nAs technology quickly changed, the Silicon Valley companies were better\npositioned to share information, adopt new trends, leverage innovation,\nand nimbly respond to new conditions. Meanwhile, vertical integration and\nclosed systems disadvantaged many Route 128 companies during periods of\ntechnological upheaval. Saxenian highlights the role of a densely networked\nculture in explaining Silicon Valley’s successful industrial adaptation as compared to Route 128.\nFinally, the third explanation of startup communities, the notion of\nthe creative class, comes from geography. Richard Florida describes the\ntie between innovation and creative-class individuals. The creative class\nis composed of individuals such as entrepreneurs, engineers, professors,\nand artists who create “meaningful new forms.” Creative-class individuals,\nFlorida argues, want to live in nice places, enjoy a culture with a tolerance for new ideas and weirdness, and—most of all—want to be around\nother creative-class individuals. This is another example of network effects,\nbecause a virtuous cycle exists where the existence of a creative class in\nan area attracts more creative-class individuals to the area, which in turn\nmakes the area even more valuable and attractive. A location that hits critical mass enjoys a competitive geographic advantage over places that have\nyet to attract a significant number of creative-class individuals.\nEach of the three explanations just outlined provides a useful lens\nto understand why the entrepreneurial world has concentrations of\nstartup communities in specific geographies. They are incomplete, however, concerning how to put a startup community into motion. There is a\nwww.itdf.ir\nPrinciples of a Vibrant Startup Community\n267\nserious chicken and egg problem; although it is not difficult to see why\ninnovation havens have an advantage, it is more challenging to explain\nhow to get a startup community up and running.\nhe Boulde hesis\nI suggest a fourth framework based on our experience in Boulder. Let’s call\nit the Boulder Thesis. This framework has four key components:\n1. Entrepreneurs must lead the startup community.\n2. The leaders must have a long-term commitment.\n3. The startup community must be inclusive of anyone who wants to\nparticipate in it.\n4. The startup community must have continual activities that engage\nthe entire entrepreneurial stack.\ned y ntepeneus\nThe most critical principle of a startup community is that entrepreneurs\nmust lead it. Lots of different people are involved in the startup community\nand many nonentrepreneurs play key roles. Unless the entrepreneurs lead,\nthe startup community will not be sustainable over time.\nIn virtually every major city, there are long lists of different types of people and organizations who are involved in the startup community including\ngovernment, universities, investors, mentors, and service providers. Historically, many of these organizations try to play a leadership role in the\ndevelopment of their local startup community. Although their involvement\nis important, they can’t be the leaders. The entrepreneurs have to be leaders.\nI define an entrepreneur as someone who has co-founded a company. I\ndifferentiate between “high-growth entrepreneurial companies” and “small\nwww.itdf.ir\nSTARTUP COMMUNITIES\n268\nbusinesses.” Both are important, but they are different things. Entrepreneurial companies have the potential to be or are high-growth businesses\nwhereas small businesses tend to be local, profitable, but slow-growth\norganizations. Small-business people are often “pillars of their community” as their businesses have a tight co-dependency with their community.\nBy contrast, founders of high-growth entrepreneurial companies generally\nare involved in the local community as employers and indirect contributors to small businesses and the local economy, but they rarely are involved\nin the broad business community because they are extraordinarily focused\non their companies.\nBecause of this intense focus, it’s unrealistic to think that all entrepreneurs in a community will be leaders. All that is needed is a critical mass of\nentrepreneurs, often less than a dozen, who will provide leadership.\nong-em ommitment\nThese leaders have to make a long-term commitment to their startup community. I like to say this has to be at least 20 years from today to reinforce\nthe sense that this has to be meaningful in length. Optimally, the commitment resets daily; it should be a forward-looking 20-year commitment.\nIt’s well understood that economies run in cycles. Economies grow,\npeak, decline, bottom out, grow again, peak again, decline again, and bottom out again. Some of these cycles are modest. Some are severe. The\nlengths vary dramatically.\nStartup communities have to take a very long-term view. A great\nstartup community such as Silicon Valley (1950–today) has a long trajectory. Although they have their booms and busts, they continued to grow,\ndevelop, and expand throughout this period of time.\nMost cities and their leaders get excited about entrepreneurship after\na major economic decline. They focus on it for a few years through a peak.\nWhen the subsequent decline ultimately happens, they focus on other\nwww.itdf.ir\nPrinciples of a Vibrant Startup Community\n269\nthings during the downturn. When things bottom out, most of the progress\ngained during the upswing was lost. I’ve seen this several times—first in the\nearly 1990s and again around the Internet bubble. All you have to do is think\nback to the nickname of your city during the Internet bubble (Silicon Alley,\nSilicon Swamp, Silicon Slopes, Silicon Prairie, Silicon Gulch, and Silicon\nMountain) to remember what it was like before and after the peak.\nThis is why the leaders have to first be entrepreneurs and then have a\nlong-term view. These leaders must be committed to the continuous development of their startup community, regardless of the economic cycle their\ncity, state, or country is in. Great entrepreneurial companies, such as Apple,\nGenentech, Microsoft, and Intel, were started during down economic cycles.\nIt takes such a long time to create something powerful that, almost by definition, you’ll go through several economic cycles on the path to glory.\nIf you aspire to be a leader of your startup community, but you aren’t\nwilling to live where you are for the next 20 years and work hard at leading the startup community for that period of time, ask yourself what your\nreal motivation for being a leader is. Although you can have impact for\na shorter period of time, it’ll take at least this level of commitment from\nsome leaders to sustain a vibrant startup community.\noste a hilosophy of nclusieness\nA startup community must be extremely inclusive. Anyone who wants to\nengage should be able to, whether they are changing careers, moving\nto your city, graduating from college, or just want to do something different. This applies to entrepreneurs, people who want to work for startups,\npeople who want to work with startups, or people who are simply intellectually interested in startups.\nThis philosophy of inclusiveness applies at all levels of the startup community. The leaders have to be open to having more leaders involved, recognizing that leaders need to be entrepreneurs who have a long-term view of\nwww.itdf.ir\nSTARTUP COMMUNITIES\n270\nbuilding their startup community. Entrepreneurs in the community need\nto welcome other entrepreneurs, viewing the growth of the startup community as a positive force for all, rather than a zero-sum game in which\nnew entrepreneurs compete locally for resources and status. Employees of\nstartups need to recruit their friends and open their homes and city to\nother people who have moved into the community.\nEveryone in the startup community should have a perspective that\nhaving more people engaged in the startup community is good for the\nstartup community. Building a startup community is not a zero-sum game\nin which there are winners and losers; if everyone engages, they and the\nentire community can all be winners.\nngage the ntie ntepeneuial tack\nStartup communities must have regular activities that engage the entire\nentrepreneurial stack. This includes first-time entrepreneurs, experienced\nentrepreneurs, aspiring entrepreneurs, investors, mentors, employees of\nstartups, service providers to startups, and anyone else who wants to be\ninvolved.\nOver the years, I’ve been to many entrepreneurial award events, periodic cocktail parties, monthly networking events, panel discussions, and\nopen houses. Although these types of activities have a role, typically in shining a bright light on the people doing good things within the startup community, they don’t really engage anyone in any real entrepreneurial activity.\nThe emergence of hackathons, new tech meetups, open coffee clubs,\nstartup weekends, and accelerators like TechStars stand out in stark contrast. These are activities and events, which I will cover in depth later in\nthis book, that last from a few hours to three months and provide a tangible, focused, set of activities for the members of the startup community\nto engage in. By being inclusive of the startup community, these activities\nconsistently engage the entire entrepreneurial stack.\nwww.itdf.ir\nPrinciples of a Vibrant Startup Community\n271\nSome of these activities will last for decades; others will go strong for\na few years and then fade away; others will fail to thrive and die quickly.\nThis dynamic is analogous to startups—it’s okay to try things that fail, and\nthe startup community must recognize when something isn’t working\nand move on. The leaders of the failed activity should try again to create things that engage the entire entrepreneurial stack, and participants in\nfailed activities should keep on engaging in stuff, recognizing that they are\nplaying a long-term game.\nwww.itdf.ir\n\n\n\nPublisher: Obsidian Press\nPrint Management: Book Lab\nCover & Table Design: Liz Dobrinska\nBook Design & Typesetting: Chinook Design, Inc.\n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\nCopyright © 2014 by Mike Michalowicz\nAll rights reserved.

Everything I learned about accounting is now out the\ndoor #pumpkinLIVE @MikeMichalowicz @creativeLIVE\n—Kali Ann Bauer @AmbientArtPhoto\nThis book was born in San Francisco. I was at the creativeLIVE studios teaching\nbusiness growth strategies from my second book, The Pumpkin Plan. During one\nof the event sessions, I explained the basic concept of the Profit First system, the\nsimple method I developed to ensure that I would have not only a financially\nhealthy business, but a seriously profitable one.\nOne of the tools of Profit First is the Instant Assessment, a way to quickly gauge\nthe real financial health of your business. When I ran the assessment on a\nvolunteer attendee, the Profit First system clicked for everyone in the room.\nAll creativeLIVE presentations are also broadcast live online and eight thousand\nviewers had tuned in for my event. Tweets and comments started flying in from\nall over the world. Because the Instant Assessment is so fast and easy, I wasn’t\ntotally surprised to see the many comments from online viewers saying that they\nhad assessed their business right then and there. Entrepreneurs, CEOs,\nfreelancers, business owners—everyone shared how relieved they were to learn\nthis simple method. It was as though they had each experienced a sudden, total\nclarity, an instant jolt of confidence about the money side of their businesses.\nI had shared the four core principles of Profit First and the Instant Assessment in\nless than thirty minutes and I saw that people didn’t just understand it, they were\nalready applying it. When a tweet came from Kali Ann Bauer\n@AmbientArtPhoto, I knew the Profit First system hit home. (Kali has since\ntaken down her Twitter account, but you can check her out at\nAmbientArtPhotographynd.com.) Here is the tweet, captured by the\ncreativeLIVE host:\nProfit First = mind blown. Everything I learned about accounting is now out the\ndoor #pumpkinLIVE @MikeMichalowicz @creativeLIVE\nBut it wasn’t until I met Debbie Horovitch that I understood just how vital it was\nthat I break down the Profit First system further and make it available to\nentrepreneurs all over the world.\nAfter the segment ended, we took a break. The camera and lighting people\nhustled to get ready for the next segment. Me? I was pumped! It was amazing to\nsee this instant evidence showing how powerful Profit First truly is. Not only did\nit work for different people with different businesses of different sizes, it worked\ninstantly. I was thrilled.\nWhen the producer ran toward me, I threw up my hand for a high-five, but she\ndidn’t see it and went in for a fist bump instead. Then ensued the most awkward\nmoment in human enthusiasm: when a high-five is met with a fist bump and\nquickly turns into a fist-five-handshake. So awkward. But she didn’t even notice.\nWith her fist in my hand, she blurted, “That was amazing! Comments are still\nflying in. Can I use Profit First for my personal life? Be sure to open the next\nsegment with a recap. Drink some water; your voice is getting a little hoarse.\nTake a quick five and then head over to makeup to get some shine off your\nforehead. And you can let go of my fist now, Mike.”\nThe producer ran over to the lighting guys; I grabbed a glass of water, chewed\non my pen and looked around to see if anyone had witnessed the fist-five.\nThat’s when Debbie Horovitch, the entrepreneur behind the Social, Sparkle &\nShine Agency—a Toronto, California firm that specializes in social media\nservices—approached me. Debbie said, “Could we put my business through the\nassessment?”\n“Sure,” I said. “It only takes a minute or two.”\nPen in my mouth, people hustling and bustling all around us, I ran through it\nright then and there. It was as if Debbie and I were in a world of our own. I\nscrawled her annual revenue number on the board. We ran the percentages.\nDebbie looked at the results and started to shake with sobs.\nShe couldn’t bear to look at where she was, or where the Instant Assessment said\nshe should be.\n“I’ve been a fool,” she said, tears streaming down her face. “Everything I have\ndone over the last ten years is wrong. I am such a fool. I am a fool. I am a fool.”\nLet me admit right now, I’m a co-crier—when people cry I go right there with\nthem. As soon as Debbie started, my eyes welled up with tears and the pen in my\nmouth dropped to the floor. I put my arm around Debbie to try to comfort her.\nFor ten years, Debbie had put her soul into her business, giving it everything she\nhad, sacrificing her personal life in order to give her business life, and yet she\ndidn’t have a dime (or a successful business) to show for it. Of course she knew\nthe truth of her struggles all along, but she had chosen to dance around that truth\nand continue to live in denial.\nPutting your nose to the grindstone is a really easy way to cover up for an\nunhealthy business. We think, if we can just work harder, longer, better—if we\ncan just hold out—something good will happen, one day. Something big is just\naround the corner, right? Something that can wipe away all of the debt, financial\nstress and worry, just like magic. After all, don’t we deserve that? Isn’t that how\nthe story is supposed to end?\nNo, my friend, that’s the movies —nothing like what we experience in real life.\nWhen Debbie ran the Instant Assessment, she had to face reality: Her business\nwas on the verge of death and it was taking her down with it. She kept saying, “I\nam a fool; I am a fool.”\nThose words tore into me, because I’d been there. I understand exactly how it\nfeels to face the naked truth about my business, my bank account, my strategies\nand my hard-fought success.\nMy own wake-up call came in the form of my daughter’s piggy bank. My story\ngoes back before that, though, back to when I began to lose my way—the day I\nreceived a check for $388,000. It was the first of several checks I would receive\nfor the sale of my second company, a multimillion-dollar computer forensic\ninvestigations business I had co-founded, to a Fortune 500 firm. I had now built\nand sold two companies, and that check was all the proof I needed that my\nfriends and family were right about me: When it came to growing businesses, I\nhad the Midas touch.\nThe day I received the check, I bought three cars: a Dodge Viper (my college\nfantasy dream car, something I promised I would get for myself “one day” when\nI “made it,” aka, the “that-guy-must-have-a-tiny-penis-car”), a Land Rover for\nmy wife, and a spare—a tricked-out BMW.\nI had always believed in frugality, but now I was rich (with an ego to match). I\njoined the private club; the one where, the more money you give, the higher they\nplace your name on the members’ wall. And I rented a house on a remote\nHawaiian island so my wife, my children and I could spend the next three or so\nweeks experiencing what our new lifestyle would be like. You know, “how the\nother half lives.”\nI thought it was time to revel in the money I had created. What I didn’t know\nwas, I was about to learn the difference between making money (income) and\naccumulating money (wealth). These are two very, very different things.\nI launched my first business on ambition and air, sleeping in my car or under\nconference room tables when visiting clients in order to avoid the cost of hotels.\nSo imagine the surprised look from my wife, Krista, when I asked the sales guy\nat the dealership for “the most expensive Land Rover you have.” Not the best\nLand Rover. Not the safest Land Rover. The most expensive Land Rover. He\nskipped his way to the manager, doing a giddy hand-clap.\nKrista looked at me and said, “Have you lost your mind? Can we really afford\nthis?”\nFull of snark, I said, “Can we afford it? We have more money than God.” I will\nnever forget the stupidity coming out of my mouth that day; such disgusting\nwords, such a disgusting ego. Krista was right. I had lost my mind—and, at least\nfor the moment, my soul.\nYup. That day was the beginning of the end. What I was well on my way to\ndiscovering was, while I knew how to make millions, what I was really, really\nproficient at doing was losing millions.\nIt wasn’t just the lifestyle I bought into that caused my financial downfall. The\ntrappings of success were a symptom of my arrogance—I believed in my own\nmythology. I was King Midas, reinvented. I could do no wrong. And because I\nhad the golden touch and knew how to build successful businesses, I decided\nthat investing in a dozen brand-new start-ups was the best way to use my\nwindfall. After all, it was only a matter of time before my entrepreneurial genius\nrubbed off on these promising companies.\nDid I care if the founders of these companies knew what they were doing? No—\nI had all the answers (read that with massive douchey emphasis). I assumed that\nmy golden touch would more than compensate for their lack of business\nexpertise. I hired a team to manage the infrastructure of all of these start-ups—\naccounting, marketing, social media, web design. I was sure I had the formula\nfor success: a promising start-up, the infrastructure and my incredible, superior,\nmagic touch (more douchey emphasis).\nThen, I started writing checks—five thousand to one person, ten thousand to\nanother, every month more checks, and still more. One time, I cut a check for\nfifty thousand dollars to cover expenses for one of these companies. In\nretrospect, it was clear that I would not be able to grow all of these companies to\nthe point where they would eventually become niche authorities, as I had with\nmy two previous companies. There was never enough revenue to cover the everincreasing mountain of bills.\nBecause of my massive ego, I didn’t allow the good people who started these\nbusinesses to become true entrepreneurs. They were just my pawns. I ignored the\nsigns and kept funneling money into my investments, sure that King Midas\nwould be able to turn it all around.\nWithin twelve months, all of the companies I invested in, save for one, went\nbelly-up. When I started writing checks to pay bills for companies that had\nalready folded, I realized that I was not an angel investor; I was the Angel of\nDeath.\nIt was a monumental disaster. Scratch that; I was a monumental disaster. Within\na couple of years, I lost nearly every penny of my hard-earned fortune. Over half\na million in savings gone. A much larger (embarrassingly larger) amount of\ninvestment money gone. Worse, I had no incoming revenue. By February 14th\nof 2008, I was down to my last ten thousand dollars.\nI will never forget that Valentine’s Day. Not because it was so full of love (even\nthough it was), but because it was the day I realized that the old adage, “When\nyou hit rock bottom, the only way to go is up,” is total bullshit. I discovered that\nday that, when you hit rock bottom, sometimes you get dragged along the\nbottom, scraping your face on every one of those rocks until you’re battered,\nbruised and bloodied.\nThat morning, I got a call at my office from Keith, my accountant. He said,\n“Good news, Mike. I got a jump-start on your taxes this year and just finished\nyour return for 2007. You only owe $28,000.”\nI felt a sharp pain in my chest, like a knife stabbing me. I remember thinking, “Is\nthis what it feels like to have a heart attack?”\nI would have to scramble to get the $18,000 I didn’t have, and then figure out\nhow to cover my mortgage next month plus all of the small recurring and\nunexpected expenses that added up to a whole lot of cash.\nAs Keith wrapped up the call, he said that the bill for his services would arrive\non Monday.\n“How much?” I asked. “Two thousand.”\nI felt the knife twist. I had $10,000 to my name and bills totaling three times that\namount. After I ended the call, I put my head on my desk and cried. I had gone\nso far astray from my values, from who I was at my core, that I had destroyed\neverything. Now, not only could I not pay my taxes; I had no idea how I would\nprovide for my family.\nAt the Michalowicz household, Valentine’s Day is a legit holiday— on a level\nwith Thanksgiving. We have a special dinner together, exchange cards and go\naround the table sharing stories about what we love about each other. This is\nwhy Valentine’s Day is my favorite day of the year. Typically, I would come\nhome with flowers, or balloons, or both. That Valentine’s Day I came home with\nnothing.\nThough I tried to hide it, my family knew something was wrong. At the dinner\ntable, Krista asked me if I was okay. That was all it took for the dam to break.\nThe shame was too great. I went from offering up forced smiles to sobbing in a\nmatter of seconds. My children stared at me, shocked and horrified. When I\nfinally stopped crying enough to speak, I said, “I lost everything. Every single\npenny.”\nTotal. Silence. I slumped over in my chair; the shame was too great for me to\nface my family, not when all the money I had earned to support them was gone.\nNot only had I failed to provide for my family; my ego had stolen it all away. To\nthis day I can find no other words to describe it: I felt pure, unadulterated shame\nabout what I had done.\nMy daughter, Adayla, who was nine years old at the time, got up from the table\nand ran to her bedroom. I couldn’t really blame her—I wanted to run away, too.\nThe silence continued for two painfully awkward minutes until Adayla walked\nback into the room carrying her piggy bank, the one she had received as a gift\nwhen she was born. It had clearly been cared for; even with all those years of\nuse, there wasn’t a single chip or crack on the bank. She had secured the rubber\nstopper in place with a combination of masking tape, duct tape and rubber bands.\nAdayla set her piggy bank down on the dining room table and slid it toward me.\nThen she said the words that will stay with me until the day I die:\n“Daddy, we’re going to make it.”\nThat Valentine’s Day I woke up feeling like Debbie Horovitch felt after her\nInstant Assessment: like a fool. But by the end of the day I learned what net\nworth really is, thanks to my nine-year-old daughter. That day I also learned that\nno amount of talent, or ingenuity, or passion or skill would change the fact that\ncash is still king. I learned that a nine-year-old girl had mastered the essence of\nfinancial security: save your money and block access to it so it doesn’t get stolen\n—by you. And I learned that I could tell myself that my natural aptitude for\nbusiness, my relentless drive and my solid work ethic could overcome any cash\ncrisis, but it would be a lie.\nRunning the Instant Assessment can be like having a bucket of ice water\ndropped on your head. Or it can seem like the most humbling moment of your\nlife, like when your daughter volunteers her life savings to save you from the\nmess you made. But no matter how sharp the pain is, it’s better to face it than\ncontinue to live and operate your business in denial.\nAt creativeLIVE, after Debbie calmed down a bit, I said, “The last ten years\nwere not wasted. I understand you feel that way right now, but it’s not true. You\nneeded to experience those years to get you where you are today, here with me,\ndoing this. You needed to reach a point where enough is enough.” To finally\nchange, she needed her piggy bank moment. We all do.\nThe truth is, Debbie is far from a fool. Fools never seek out answers. Fools never\nrealize there is a different way, even if it’s staring them right in the face. Fools\ndon’t admit they need to change. Debbie faced the music, realized what she was\ndoing wasn’t working and decided she would not stand for it anymore. Debbie is\nsmart and courageous, and a hero, too. She implored me to put her story in this\nbook and not cloak her name… for you. Debbie wanted you to know you’re not\nalone.\nThe majority of small businesses, and medium businesses, and even some big\nones are barely surviving. That guy driving the new Tesla, whose children go to\nprivate school via chauffeur and who lives in a massive house and runs a three\nmillion-dollar company, is one bad month from declaring bankruptcy. I should\nknow; he’s my neighbor.\nThe entrepreneur who says “business is great” at the networking event is the\nsame woman who later tries to ask me a question in the parking lot that is\nindecipherable through her tears; she’s crying because she hasn’t been able to\npay herself a salary for almost a year and will soon be evicted from her home.\nThat particular incident happened last night, twelve hours before I wrote it down\nto become a story for this book. It’s just one of many similar conversations I’ve\nhad with entrepreneurs who are afraid to tell the truth about their financials.\nThe Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award recipient who is changing the\nworld, who is lauded as the next generation of genius, who is destined to be on\nthe cover of Fortune Magazine because of his business acumen, is taking out\nbank loan after bank loan and racking up credit card debt to cover payroll behind\nthe scenes. I should know; that was me.\nThere is no elephant in the room. This dirty little secret is bigger than an\nelephant—it’s King Kong, people! King Kong is in the room. And today is the\nday we call it what is. Today is the day we draw a line in the sand and never\naccept it again. Today is the day we make your business (and your life, in the\nprocess) financially strong. Permanently.\nI have done it for myself. I have done it with companies I partnered with. And I\nhave taught countless others how to do this and watched gleefully as their\nbusinesses turned the corner toward profitability.\nI promise you, with everything I am, if you follow the system I detail in these\npages, this book will do the same for you. The process is simple. Shockingly\nsimple, once you know the trick. Sticking to it is the hard part. So I am going to\ngive you both—how to do it and how to stick with it.\nYou have probably put a lot of work into growing your business. You are\nprobably good or great at that part. That’s awesome. And that’s surely half of the\nequation. But colossal growth without financial health will still kill your\ncompany. A hot body is useless if its blood is poisoned; money is the lifeblood\nof your business. With this book, you have an opportunity to master money.\nMoney is the foundation. Without enough money, we cannot take our message,\nour products or our services to the world. Without enough money, we are slaves\nto the businesses we launched. I find this hilarious because, in large part, we\nstarted our businesses because we wanted to be free.\nWithout enough money, we cannot fully realize our authentic selves. Money\namplifies who we are. There isn’t a single ounce of doubt in my mind that you\nare intended to do something big on this planet.\nYou wear the cape of what I believe is the greatest of all superheroes: The\nEntrepreneur. But your superhero powers can only yield as much power as your\nenergy source provides. Money. You need money, superhero.\nWhen I sat down to evaluate where I went wrong I realized that, while my own\nspending and arrogance definitely played a part, I also lacked knowledge. I had\nmastered how to grow businesses quickly, yet I never really graduated to\nunderstanding profitability. I had learned how to collect money, for sure, but I\nhad never learned how to keep it, how to control it or how to grow it.\nI knew how to grow a business from nothing, working with whatever resources I\nhad; but as revenue increased, so did my spending. I discovered that this was the\nway I ran both my personal life and my business. I took pride in making magic\nhappen with pennies in my pocket, but as soon as I got some real cash, I made\nsure that I had a very good reason to spend it. It was a check-to-check lifestyle,\nbut sustainable—as long as sales sustained and did not dip.\nWhile my companies grew explosively, I still operated them on a check-to-check\nbasis—and I had no idea that this was a problem. The point was to grow, right?\nIncrease sales and the profit will take care of itself, right?\nWrong. Money problems occur when one of two things happen:\n1. Sales slow down. The problem here is obvious—when we operate\ncheck-to -check and sales slow down, we don’t have enough to cover\nexpenses.\n2. Sales speed up. This problem here is not obvious, but it is insidious.\nAs our income climbs, expenses quickly follow. Consistent incoming\ncash flow is hard to sustain. Big deposits feel great, but are irregular.\nDrought periods come quickly and unexpectedly, causing a major gap\nin cash flow. And cutting back on expenses is nearly impossible\nbecause our business (and personal) lifestyle is locked in at our new\nlevel. Exchanging the newly leased car for a rust-bucket, laying off\nemployees because we’re overstaffed, saying no to our partners—all of\nthis is very hard to do because of the agreements and promises we\nmade. Cutting expenses becomes impossible because we don’t want to\nadmit we’ve been wrong in how we’ve been growing our businesses.\nSo rather than reduce our costs in any meaningful way, we scramble to\ncover ridiculously high expenses. We steal from Peter to pay Paul,\nhoping for another big payout.\nSound familiar? I thought it might. Over the last five years I’ve connected with\nentrepreneurs at every level of growth, and this “top line” (revenue-focused),\ncheck-to-check methodology is more common than you may realize. We assume\nthat multimillion-dollar companies are turning big profits, but it’s rare to find a\ntruly profitable business. Most entrepreneurs are just covering their monthly nut\n(or worse) and accumulating massive debt.\nWe think bigger is better, but so often all we get with a bigger business are\nbigger problems.\nWithout an understanding of profitability, every business, no matter how big, no\nmatter how “successful,” is a house of cards. I made a lot of money with my first\ntwo businesses, but not because I ran a tight fiscal ship. I was just lucky enough\nto keep the plates spinning fast enough and the company growing big enough\nthat someone else was willing to buy it and fix the financial problems.\nI sold my first two businesses for a big payout and so did not learn the ultimate\nfinancial lesson until after I invested in a dozen more businesses and the lesson\ncame in hard. After my house of cards fell, I set out on a mission to find a better\nway, a simpler way, a highly effective way to ensure that all businesses,\nregardless of size and regardless of their current state of affairs, could end the\ncheck-to- check cycle and become instantly profitable—without chasing the big\npayout.\nAnd I found it.\nSimply put, the Profit First system flips the accounting formula. To date,\nentrepreneurs, CEOS, freelancers, everyone in nearly every type of business has\nbeen using the “sell, pay expenses, and see what’s left over” method of profit\ncreation. This ingrained belief has us sell first, then pay expenses, and let the\nprofit take care of itself. Which it rarely does, because the profit is what’s left\nover. An afterthought. Profit surely isn’t baked into the daily operations. For\nmany entrepreneurs profit is only considered after the fact. Sometimes monthly.\nSometimes quarterly. And way too often, annually, when their accountant is\npreparing the tax returns.\nThe old, been-around-forever, profitless formula is:\nSales – Expenses = Profit\nThe new, Profit First Formula is:\nSales – Profit = Expenses\nThe math in both formulas is the same. Logically, nothing has changed. But\nProfit First speaks to human behavior—it accounts for the regular Joes of the\nworld, like me, who have a tendency to spend all of whatever is available to us.\nSo in this regard, with the Profit First flip, everything has changed. Now you\nsecure your profit first, and run your business on the remaining cash you have\nleft.\nIt comes down to this—do you want to treat your profitability like leftovers,\nknowing you may only find scraps or an empty plate? Or do you want to get\nyour full, healthy share right up front? I don’t know about you, but I want to get\nmy due portion first.\nI have taught the Profit First system to small companies and big companies, to\nprivate companies and even public companies. It works for all of them. And it\nwill work for you.\nMy commitment to you is that, if you follow the Profit First system, your\nbusiness will become permanently profitable from the moment of your next\ndeposit.\nSince I began following the system, I have built two more businesses for myself\nthat are now growing at a healthy rate, profitable right from the start. And the\none business that managed to survive my Angel-of-Death spending spree? We\nimplemented Profit First and that business is now not only the leader of its niche;\nit also turns a profit every month.\nIn the pages of this book, you will discover how to make your business\npermanently profitable. The Profit First system is simple—as I said, shockingly\nso. But don’t confuse simple with easy. Understanding what I am about to reveal\nto you will be a no -brainer. Having the discipline to do it and follow through\nwill be the challenge. I will ready you for both.\nProvided you take each action step I recommend, you will have transformed\nyour business by the end of Chapter 5. Do I want you to read the rest of the\nbook? Hell yes! In fact, if you want to fully realize your potential as a business\nleader and take your business where you know it was meant to go, you need to\nread the rest of the book. Consider Chapters 6 through 12 the intermediate and\nadvanced courses in Profit First, in which you will learn all of the methods,\ntactics and tweaks that will ensure your cash cow continues to make your life\neasier, happier and more fulfilling. In essence, Chapters 1 through 5 will revive\nyour business. Chapters 6 through 12 will revive you.\nFollowing the Profit First system will take courage and dedication; it will require\nyou to set your own ego aside. The payoff is worth it, so worth it.\nIf you will commit to fixing your business’s financials once and for all, you’ll\nnever have to pull off a last-minute miracle to cover anything again. You’ll\nnever have to have your own “piggy bank” moment, as I did, or feel like a fool,\nas my friend Debbie did when she first realized the financial reality of her\nbusiness.\nWhen you commit to following the simple but powerful Profit First system, you\nwill finally reap the rewards of entrepreneurship, cashing in on your business—\nwhile still running it—over and over again, like clockwork.\nToday is the day you say enough is enough. Whether your business is\nexperiencing occasional financial stress or total financial horror, today is the day\nwe fix it. Today is the day your business becomes permanently profitable.\nCHAPTER ONE: Taming The Beast\nI am Dr. Frankenstein.\nOkay, not the Dr. Frankenstein, but I am definitely part of the family. I’m\nprobably his long lost twin brother, or something. Or maybe an estranged heir to\nhis (mis)fortune. Maybe you are, too.\nIf you read Mary Shelley’s classic, Frankenstein, you know exactly what I’m\ntalking about. The good doctor reanimated life. From mismatched body parts, he\nstitched together a living being more monster than man. Of course, his creation\nwasn’t a monster at first. No, at first it was a miracle. Dr. Frankenstein brought\nto life something that, without his extraordinary idea and exhaustive hard work,\nwould not exist.\nThat’s what I did. That’s what you did. We brought something to life that didn’t\nexist before we dreamed it up; we created a business out of thin air. Impressive!\nMiraculous! Beautiful! Or at least it was, until the monster revealed itself.\nStitching together a business with nothing but a great idea, your unique talents\nand whatever few resources you have at hand is most certainly a miracle. And it\nfeels like one, too. Until the day you realize your business has become a giant,\nscary, soul-sucking, cash-eating monster. That’s the day you discover that you,\ntoo, are an esteemed member of the Frankenstein family.\nAnd, just as happened in Shelley’s book, mental and physical torment ensues.\nYou try to tame the monster, but you can’t. The monster wreaks destruction at\nevery turn: empty bank accounts, credit card debt, loans and an ever-increasing\nlist of “must-pay” expenses. He eats up your time, too. You wake up before\nsunrise to work, and you’re still at it long after the sun goes down. You work and\nwork, yet the monster continues to loom. Your relentless work doesn’t free you;\nit further drains you. Trying to keep the monster at bay before it destroys your\nentire world is exhausting. You suffer sleepless nights, worries about collection\ncalls—sometimes from your own employees—and a near-constant panic about\nhow to cover next week’s bills with a few dollars and the lint in your pocket.\nWhat is the only way out we can see? Growth. It is the battle cry of nearly every\nentrepreneur and business leader. Grow! Grow! Grow! Bigger sales. Bigger\ncustomers. Bigger investors.\nThe only problem is, it doesn’t work.\nGrowth is only half the equation. It is a critical half, but still only half. Have you\never seen the guys at the gym with the massive arms and heaving chests, the\nones as big as oxen who also have toothpick legs? They’re only working half the\nequation and have become unhealthy freaks as a result. Sure, that guy can throw\na monster punch, but God forbid he needs to step into it, or move a little. His\npuny legs will give out instantly; he’ll curl up on the floor and cry like a baby.\nMost business owners try to grow their way out of their problems, hinging\nsalvation on the next big sale or customer or investor, but the result is simply a\nbigger monster. (And the bigger your company gets, the more anxiety you deal\nwith. If both are cash-eating monsters, a $300,000 company is much easier to\nmanage than a $3,000,000 company. I know; I have survived operating both, and\nbigger.) This is constant growth without concern for health. And the day that big\nsale or customer or investor doesn’t show, you will fall to the ground and curl up\ncrying like a baby.\nIf you think operating your business is closer to a horror story than to a fairy\ntale, you’re not alone. Since I wrote my first book, The Toilet Paper\nEntrepreneur, I’ve met thousands of entrepreneurs; and let me tell you, most are\nstruggling to tame the beast that is their business. Many companies—even those\nthat appear to have it all together, even the big guys who seem to dominate their\nindustries—struggle to stay afloat.\nI’ll never forget meeting the owner of a $15,000,000 company who furnished his\nhouse with plastic lawn furniture because he couldn’t afford the real stuff. What\ndoes it say when the leader of a multimillion-dollar company can’t even swing a\ntrip to Ikea? It would make anyone question his true wealth, and the wealth and\nhealth of his business.\nSo what’s the solution? How do you not only make it out of this situation alive,\nbut also build the miracle of a business you originally envisioned, a business that\nserves you, a business that provides for you? The solution isn’t a bigger monster.\nThe solution surely isn’t a second and third monster. The solution isn’t killing\nyour existing monster, or even hacking it apart and stitching it back together into\na tiny monster. In fact, the solution is shockingly simple and surprisingly\neffective.\nIt begins by working with your natural tendencies, not against them.\nCHECK-TO-CHECK AND PANIC-TO-PANIC\nHave you ever had the thought that the universe knows exactly how much extra\nmoney you have? A customer pays up on a $ 4000 past-due invoice you wrote\noff months ago and later that week your delivery truck breaks down—for good.\nBye-bye, $4000. You land a new client and a wad of cash drops into your lap;\nonly minutes later you remember that this is a three-payroll month. Oh well, at\nleast now you’ll almost be able to cover it. Or you get a credit on your credit\ncard account for an accidental billing (woo hoo, found money!), only to discover\nanother charge on your credit card for something that you forgot all about.\nIt’s not the universe that knows how much we have in our bank accounts. It’s us.\nWe default to managing the cash of our business by doing what I call “bank\nbalance accounting.”\nIf you’re like most entrepreneurs, and me, this is how it works: You look at your\nbank balance and see a chunk of change. Yippee!\nYou feel great for about ten minutes, and then decide to pay all the bills that\nhave been piling up. The balance goes to zero and very quickly you feel that alltoo-familiar tightening in the chest as your throat dries up (or any number of\nsymptoms of stress).\nWhat do we do when, instead of a decent bank balance, we see that there’s next\nto nothing there? We immediately panic a little (or a lot). We hit “go” mode:\nneed to sell fast! Need to make collection calls! Need to pretend the bills never\narrived, or send out checks and “accidentally” forget to sign them. When we\nknow our bank balance is super low (I’m talking limbo “how low can you go”-\nlow), we’ll do anything to buy the only thing we can afford: time.\nI’m going to go out on a limb and guess that you only look at your income\nstatement on occasion. I suspect you rarely look at your cash flow statements or\nbalance sheet. And if you do, I doubt you review these docs on a daily basis or\nunderstand exactly what they say. Bet you check your bank account every day,\nthough? It’s okay. If you look at your bank account daily, I want to congratulate\nyou, because that means you are a typical—scratch that—a normal business\nleader; that’s how most entrepreneurs behave.\nIt’s human nature to look at what you have right now and make decisions based\non that information. This is called the “Recency Effect,” the psychological\nphenomenon in which we humans (that’s you, by the way) place a\ndisproportionate significance on what we experienced most recently. For\nexample, if I ask you to recall the last few words I wrote, you will easily recall\nthis sentence (the most recent), but good luck remembering two sentences ago.\nRecent stuff is the big stuff; all the other stuff becomes a waning memory. How\ndoes the Recency Effect apply to your finances? If you deposit lots of money\ntoday, you will probably feel great, the outlook for your business will appear to\nbe good and all will seem well. That’s the Recency Effect. If, on the other hand,\nyour bank account is bone dry, you might feel hopeless and your business may\nseem like a horrible mess. (Maybe as though it’s a monster?) That’s the Recency\nEffect. It is a trap because it dictates our behavior.\nAlso in our nature as entrepreneurs is the desire to find problems and fix them.\nThis is how we manage money. When we have enough money in the bank, we\nthink we don’t have money problems, and so we focus on other challenges.\nWhen we see that we don’t have enough money in the bank, we go on red alert\nand take immediate action to fix our money problems, usually by trying to\ncollect revenue quickly, or sell a big-ticket item or some combination of the two.\nWe use the money we have to pay the bills we owe; when we don’t have enough\nto cover everything, we try to get more money through sales and collections.\nExcept that to support new revenue, we now have a host of new related\nexpenses, so the cycle starts all over again. If you haven’t relied on it from the\nstart, eventually the only “solution” is to take on debt—a second mortgage on\nyour family home, a line of credit tied to your building, a stack of credit cards\nthree inches high. This is how many entrepreneurs end up operating their\nbusinesses check-to-check and panic-to-panic.\nSo let me ask you a question. How easy would it be to grow your business if you\noperated this way? Do you think you’d ever be able to get off this roller coaster\nride? Could you dig yourself out of debt using this system? Of course not.\nAnd yet bank balance accounting is human nature. We humans are not big on\nchange. Change is hard. With your very best intentions, changing your natural\ntendencies to operate your business based on how much cash you see in your\naccount would take years. I don’t know, you tell me—do you have years to make\nyour own transformation before your very own monster destroys everything? I\nsure as hell didn’t.\nThis is why, if we are to free ourselves from living check-to-check and panic-topanic, we must find a method that works with our nature, not against it.\nWithout an effective money management system that does not require massive\nmindset change, we get stuck in trying to sell our way out of our struggles. Sell\nmore. Sell faster. Get money any way you can. It is trap—a dangerous trap that\nwould even have Frankenstein’s monster poopin’ his panties. It’s the Survival\nTrap.\nTHE SURVIVAL TRAP\nThis is how the Survival Trap works. Take a look at Figure 1 on the next page.\nWe are at point A (which is really called crisis) and we want to get to point B\n(which is our vision for our future). The thing is, our vision is usually very\nvague. Instead of a clear statement of our products or services and the clients we\nwant to serve, it might be something like, “I want a lot of money and some relief\nfrom stress.” The connection between Point A and Point B is never defined,\nbeyond, “Sell, baby! Just sell!” And “just selling” is a huge part of the trap, for\nthree reasons:\nFirst, any sale feels like a good sale, because sales help to temporarily lift you\nout of crisis. Now look at the figure. You can see that many of the decisions we\nmake around “just selling” in fact take us farther away from our vision.\nMaybe you start offering a new service, or add a new product, because it will\nmake fast money, but never even consider that it has nothing to do with what\nyou want your company to become or whom you want your company to serve.\nTake for example my lawn guy, Ernie. He, like most lawn guys in the Northeast,\nmakes tons of money removing leaves. This past fall he knocked on my door and\nsaid that he noticed leaves in my gutters and would gladly clean them up. He has\na captive client (me), and can now sell me another service. Easy money. When\nhe was on the roof, he noticed my shingles needed repair. He offered roofing\nservices. Why not repair my chimney, too?\nIt is very easy to go from being a guy who rakes lawns to a guy who fixes\nchimneys because of the opportunity for “easy money” with captive clients. The\nmoney may be easy, but what about the costs to do it all? Rakes and blowers for\nyard work are useless when working on roofs or chimneys. Now this guy needs\nladders, roofing gear, bricks and other materials. And most importantly, he needs\nthe skills to complete the tasks, which means hiring skilled labor or going back\nto raking, gutter-cleaning, roofing and chimney school. Each new “easy sale”\ntook Ernie farther from his vision for his lawn-raking business.\nThe Survival Trap promises fast wealth, but when we’re caught in it we rarely\nthink about the massive cost of opportunity; and most of the time, we can’t\ndiscern profitable income from debt-generating income. Instead of being the\nworld’s best at one thing, mastering the process of delivering perfectly and\nsuper-efficiently, we end up doing a greater variety of things and become less\nand less efficient at each step, while our businesses become more and more\ncostly to run.\nThe Survival Trap is not about driving toward our vision. It is all about taking\naction, any action, to get out of crisis. Any of the actions shown in Figure 1 will\nget a us out of an immediate crisis. But, by taking actions like those on the left of\nthe circle, we get out of crisis, sure enough, but we are going in the opposite\ndirection from our vision at Point B. Other actions shown on the diagram don’t\ntake us in the opposite direction, but are askew. Only when you stay in the\nchannel of the horizontal dotted lines do you make your vision for your business\na reality.\nAll of the “just sell” actions we take in the moment bring temporary relief. They\nget us out of immediate crisis, but when the money dries up again the following\nday, and as the expenses grow the following week or month, we find ourselves\nin crisis again and the pattern repeats. We take money from anyone (and I mean\nanyone) willing to pay us. Money from bad clients. Money for bad projects.\nMoney from our own pockets (if there’s anything left in them besides two dimes,\na stick of gum and a wad of lint). In this way, we stay stuck on the roller coaster\nride that is surviving check-to-check and panic-to-panic.\nSecond, the Survival Trap is deceptive because it fools us into thinking we are at\nleast inching toward our vision. Consider the actions on the right side of the\nFigure 1. For instance, a “just sell” approach will, by pure happenstance, also\noccasionally move us toward our vision, we can easily trick ourselves into\nbelieving that we’re on the right track. Sometimes we make a crisis decision\nwithout considering our vision or the path to get there and we get it right.\nHappenstance happens. At that point we say, “See! I’m getting there. Things are\nclicking. Things are coming together.” But this is random chance, resulting from\ncrisis, not focus or clarity, and therefore false. It is like believing that because\nyou once won on a scratch-off card, the lottery is a good investment strategy.\nAnd it is this kind of thinking that quickly lands us back in crisis mode.\nLast, when we’re stuck in the Survival Trap, we focus our attention on revenue\ngeneration first and foremost. Any client (who pays) is a good client. Any work\n(that makes money) is good work. Crisis makes us panic about money. We need\nmore money now! Never forget: All revenue is not the same. Some revenue\ncosts you significantly more in time and money; some costs you less. You must\ndistinguish between the two, since one is profitable and the other puts you out of\nbusiness.\nI explained the Profit First system to my friend Debra Courtright many years\nback. Debra runs DAC Management, a bookkeeping business. (I’ll give you one\nguess at her middle initial.) Since the day she integrated the Profit First system,\nDebra has saved company after company using these principles, the exact\nprinciples I am about to teach you. Actually, she has more than just saved\ncompanies; she consistently turns business after business into cash cows.\nOver the years, we have discussed the effects of Profit First on her clients and\nmade some tweaks along the way. She has shared many stories, always\nremoving the names of the guilty. When Debra told me the story I am about to\nshare with you, my jaw dropped. The story is about someone I’ve never met,\nabout a business I’ve never visited, but it’s a perfect example of the Survival\nTrap, played out.\nDebra received an inquiry from Alex, a prospective client. When she called\nDebra, Alex was literally gasping for air on the other end of the line. The owner\nof a local bistro, Alex did not have enough money in the bank to pay her\nemployees or vendors, let alone herself. Her accounting was so messed up she\ndidn’t even know to whom she owed money.\nDebra immediately implemented a customized version of Profit First (something\nI will teach you to do for yourself in Chapter 4). While setting up a Profit\nAccount, Owner’s Pay Account, Tax Account and Operating Expenses Account,\nshe asked Alex where she kept the sales tax records.\nAlex looked at her blankly and said, “What do you mean?”\nTurns out, Alex had been charging customers seven percent sales tax, but rather\nthan reporting the earnings and sending the tax to the government, she was using\nthe money to pay other bills.\nDebra explained the consequences. “If you don’t pay the taxes you collect, you\nare breaking the law. The state’s tax authority can come in here unannounced,\nshut everything down and walk away with every asset you have. Then they will\nsend you to jail, broke and in debt.”\nAlex thought she had time to sort everything out, but the very next week,\nDebra’s warning became a reality. The tax reps from the state showed up\nunannounced at Alex’s bistro.\nThey decided to show her mercy. In front of her customers and employees, they\nemptied the cash register and handed Alex a letter that basically said, “Pay your\nsales taxes immediately, or we will shut you down and send you to jail.” Cue the\nnext anxiety attack, and Alex’s next breathless call to Debra. And yes, that is the\ntax man showing mercy.\nThe Survival Trap is an ugly beast. It buys you time, but the monster gets bigger\nand bigger. And at some point it will destroy you.\nSustained profitability depends on efficiency. You can’t become efficient in\ncrisis. In crisis, we justify making money at any cost, right now, even if it means\nskipping taxes or selling our souls. In crises, the Survival Trap becomes our\nmodus operandi—until our survival strategies create a new, more devastating\ncrisis that scares us straight, as it did Alex, or, more commonly, scares us right\nout of business.\nPart of the problem is bank balance accounting—looking at the money in your\nbank account as one pool from which you can operate your business without first\naddressing tax issues or your own salary, never mind profit. This leads to top\nline thinking—focusing on revenue first, last, and always. That thinking is\nsupported by the traditional accounting method public companies must use and\nmost small businesses elect to use: GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting\nPrinciples).\nGAAP IS KILLING YOUR BUSINESS\nSince the dawn of time—or shortly thereafter—businesses have kept track of\ntheir earnings and expenditures using essentially the same method:\nSales – Expenses = Profit\nIf you manage the numbers like most entrepreneurs, you start with sales (the top\nline) and then subtract costs directly related to the delivery of your offering\n(product or service). Then you subtract all the other costs you incur to run your\nbusiness: rent, utilities, office supplies and other administrative expenses, sales\ncommissions, taking your client out to lunch, signage, insurance, etc., etc. Then\nyou pay taxes. Then, and only then, do you take your owner’s distribution\n(owner’s salary, profit distribution, etc.).\nLet’s be honest, entrepreneurs hardly ever take anything close to a real salary,\nand good luck telling the government that you decided to skip taxes this year so\nthat you could pay yourself. Finally, after all that, you post your company’s\nprofit. And if your experience is like the majority of entrepreneurs, you never get\nto “finally.” When you’re waiting for the leftovers, at best you’ll get scraps.\nThis method ultimately became formalized in the early 1900s. The particulars\nare updated regularly, but the core system remains the same. Start with sales.\nSubtract direct costs (the costs you directly incur to create and deliver your\nproduct or service). Pay employees. Subtract indirect costs. Pay taxes. Pay\nowners (owner distributions). Retain or distribute profit (the bottom line). Even\nif you outsource your bookkeeping or keep a shoebox of receipts under your bed,\nyou know the basic idea.\nLogically, GAAP makes complete sense. It suggests that we sell as much as we\ncan, spend as little as we can and pocket the difference. But humans aren’t\nlogical. (One episode of Bridezilla pretty much proves that.) Just because GAAP\nmakes logical sense doesn’t mean it makes “human sense.” GAAP both\nsupersedes our natural behavior and makes us believe bigger is better. So we try\nto sell more. We try, and try, and try to sell our way to success. We do\neverything we can to make the top line (revenue) grow so that something,\nanything, will drip down to the bottom line. It becomes a relentless cycle of\nchasing after every shiny object disguised as opportunity (that’s “little\npumpkins” to my peeps—you know who you are).\nThroughout this haphazard, often desperate, growth process, our expenses are\nlost in the wash—we just pay as we go. They’re all necessary, right? Or at least\nwe think so. Who knows? We’re too busy hunting down sales and trying to\ndeliver on all of our promises to worry about the impact of expenses!\nWe try to spend less without considering investments versus costs. We don’t\nthink about leveraging our spending to get way more mileage out of way less.\nWe can’t. The more variety of stuff we sell, the more our cost of doing\nbusinesses rises. We need to spend more to grow. They say it takes money to\nmake money. But how come no one ever told us what that really translates to: It\ntakes more money to make less money.\nAs our monster gets bigger, the need to feed the beast gets out of hand. Now\nwe’re faced with covering expenses for more employees, more stuff, more\neverything. The monster grows. And grows. And grows. Meanwhile, we’re still\ndealing with the same problems, just bigger: more empty bank accounts, higher\nstacks of credit card bills, bigger loans and an ever-increasing list of “must-pay”\nexpenses. Sound familiar, Dr. Frankenstein?\nGAAP’s fundamental flaw is, it goes against human nature. No matter how\nmuch income we generate, we will always find a way to spend it—all of it. And\nwe have good reasons for all of our spending choices. Everything is justified.\nEverything is necessary. Soon enough, whatever money we had in the bank\ndwindles down to nothing as we struggle to cover every “necessary” expense.\nWe get caught in the trap of sell-grow-spend, sell-grow-spend.\nHow do you think Debra’s client Alex ended up in her predicament? Do you\nthink she said, “It’s a beautiful day today—I think I’ll steal from the\ngovernment”? Heck, no. She had convinced herself that she needed the sales tax\nincome she collected right now, and when “later” came, she wasn’t prepared to\ncover it.\nA secondary flaw is this: GAAP teaches us to focus on sales and expenses first.\nOnce again, it works against our human nature, which urges us to grow what we\nfocus on. Remember the lesson of the Recency Effect; it plays out again with the\nfocus on sales and expenses. There is a saying: “What gets measured, gets\ndone.” GAAP has us measure sales first (it is the top line, after all), and therefore\nwe sell like mad while expenses are treated like a necessary evil to support—\nyou guessed it—more sales. We spend all that we have, because we believe we\nmust. And we use terms like “plowback” or “reinvest” to feel good about it.\nProfit? Your salary? Mere afterthoughts. Leftovers.\nAnother problem with GAAP is, it is overwhelmingly complex. You need to hire\nan accountant to get it right, and when you ask the accountant the details about\nGAAP, he is likely to get confused. The system changes and is up for\ninterpretation. And we can play games with GAAP: Move some numbers around\nand post stuff in different spots and the numbers look different. Just ask Enron—\nthey were able to post profits as they were going bankrupt. Yuck!\nAt the end of the day, the start of a new day, and every second in between, cash\nis all that counts. It is the lifeblood of your business. Do you have it or not? If\nyou don’t, you’re in trouble, and if you do, you can sustain.\nGAAP was never intended to only manage cash. It is a system for understanding\nall the elements of your business. It has three key reports: the income statement,\nthe cash flow statement and the balance sheet. There is no question that you need\nto understand these reports, since they will give you a holistic view of your\ncompany; they are powerful and highly useful tools. But the essence of GAAP\n(Sales - Expenses = Profit) is horribly flawed. It is a formula that builds\nmonsters. It is the Frankenstein Formula.\nTo successfully run a profitable business, we need a super-simple system to\nmanage our cash, one we can understand without help from an accountant, one\nthat is designed for humans, not Spock.\nWe need a system that can instantly tell us the truth about the health of our\nbusinesses, one that we can look at and know instantly what we need to do to get\nhealthy; a system that tells us what we can actually spend and what needs to be\nreserved; a system that doesn’t require us to change, but automatically works\nwith our natural behaviors.\nProfit First is that system.\n• • •\nThe ending of Frankenstein is not happy or nicey-nice. The monster destroys\neverything in Dr. Frankenstein’s life—his wife, his family, his hope for the\nfuture—so he sets out to exact revenge and kill his creation. The hunt for the\nmonster takes a toll on Dr. Frankenstein and he dies a wrecked man, the monster\nclose behind him. Frankenstein is a scary parallel to the extremes of\nentrepreneurship. Monster businesses have killed marriages, torn apart families\nand, for some entrepreneurs, decimated any hope for the good life. That miracle\nof a business we created can end up causing untold suffering; when that happens,\nthe hatred Dr. Frankenstein had for his monster is all too often the chief emotion\nentrepreneurs have toward their businesses.\nBut your story doesn’t have to end that way. You can have your happily ever\nafter. The good news is that, while your business may seem to be a monster\ncontrolling your life, it is also powerful. Whether your annual revenue is\n$50,000, $500,000, $5,000,000 or even $50,000,000, your business can become\na profit-generating workhorse.\nNever forget the power of your “monster”—you just have to understand how to\ndirect and control it. When you learn this simple system, your business will no\nlonger be a monster; it will become an obedient, pasture-loving cash cow. A\ndamn strong one, at that.\nIt worked for Alex, the coffee-shop owner who neglected to pay her sales tax\nand paid the consequences. Working with Debra, her accountant, and applying\nProfit First, Alex has paid off all of her taxes and penalties. It took three years to\nrecover, but now Alex is current with her taxes and is running a profitable\nbusiness. She has fewer employees, but they are fantastic and run the place like\nclockwork. Business is humming, and freshly ground coffee is always brewing.\nWhat I am about to share with you is going to make your business profitable\nimmediately and determinately. I don’t care what size business you have or how\nlong you have been surviving check-to-check and panic-to-panic, month after\nmonth and year after year. You are about to be profitable. Forevermore. No more\nleftovers for you— it’s time for you to eat first.\nHere’s the deal. There is only one way to fix your financials: by facing your\nfinancials. You can’t ignore them. You can’t let someone else take care of them.\nYou need to take charge of the numbers. But there is good news—the process is\nreally, really easy. In fact, you will fundamentally understand it, and implement\nit, within just a few more chapters.\nACTION STEPS\nGET YOUR HEAD IN THE GAME\nStep 1: Draw the line in the sand. Agree that, as of today, you are turning over a\nnew leaf. Commit to yourself, and to me, that you will run a profitable business\nand make everything else secondary to that goal. Email me (my contact info is\non my website, and I do read my own email) and decree that you are drawing a\nline in the sand. Today is the day your business becomes healthy. Permanently.\nDon’t wait another second.\nStep 2: Agree not to beat yourself up. I don’t care what your business financials\nlook like today. I don’t care if your business is on the verge of going under, or if\nyou just want to ramp up your profits even higher. Every business can be\nimproved with Profit First. The only thing that will get in our way is if you bitch,\nmoan and cry about the past. So that will not be permitted. I am granting you a\nclean slate. And you are promising me that you aren’t going to complain about\nthe past. Together, we are just going to get to work and fix it.\nCHAPTER TWO: How Profit First Works\nIt’s funny how losing nearly all of your money can cause you to watch a lot of\nlate-night network TV. What? Before you side-eye me, this was right after I lost\nall of my money to my own arrogance, so cable TV was the first thing to go.\nInsomnia brought about by anxiety does not equal better quality sleep, so that\npretty much left me with two options: Stare at the ceiling or watch late-night\nnetwork TV, courtesy of my twelve-dollar, indoor rabbit-ear antenna (yes,\nantennae still work and, even with the fancy modern digital signal, the reception\nstill sucks).\nMost infomercials pitch instant cures. Eat only grapefruit for ten weeks, and\npresto! You’re thin. Drink this magic goo three times a day and before you know\nit you’ll be able to bounce a quarter off your ripped abs! Wrap this\nelectromagnetic thingamajig around your waist, electrocute yourself every five\nseconds, and you’ll have a teeny-tiny waist in less than six weeks, all while\nnever getting off the couch to clean the Doritos off your shirt!\nOne late night, I had had enough of the infomercials and turned on PBS to find,\nsure enough, a fitness guy talking about diets. (Was God trying to tell me\nsomething? I stopped working out for a little bit, but. . . jeez!)\nThe fitness expert explained to the studio audience that the quick fixes lauded by\nlate-night infomercials didn’t work (thank you!) and that they weren’t\nsustainable. He said that what we really need are simple lifestyle fixes that do not\nrequire us to change our natural tendencies, changes that make an impact before\nwe have a chance to screw it up with our unhealthy food choices. And his first fi\nx suggestion? Smaller plates.\nNow riveted, I watched as the man explained that our natural human behavior is\nto fill our plates with food and, because Mom said so, clean that plate right up by\neating everything on it. I still don’t get Mom’s logic—there are children starving\nin Africa, so I need to get fat? But the “clean-your-plate club” was instilled in\nme and probably in you, too. The message is ingrained. Changing that habit for a\nday is a no-brainer. But changing it permanently? That’s hard. Some would say\nit’s nearly impossible. This is why so many people who diet gain the weight\nback, why people rarely follow through on New Year’s resolutions past the end\nof January, and why it’s so difficult to be disciplined with your spending.\nAs I continued to watch the program, the expert went on to say that rather than\nwork to change our “eat everything on the plate” behavior we simply need to\nchange the size of our plates. When we use smaller plates, we dish out smaller\nportions, thus eating fewer calories while continuing our natural human behavior\nof serving a full plate and eating all of what is served.\nI sat straight up on the couch, my mind alert with this new revelation. The\nsolution is not to try to change our ingrained habits, which is really hard to pull\noff and nearly impossible to sustain; but instead to change the structure around\nus and leverage those habits.\nIt was then that I realized: Every penny my company made was going onto one\nplate, and I was gobbling it all up, using every last scrap to operate my business.\nEvery dollar that came in went into one account, my operating account, and I\nwas “eating it all.”\nIt hurts to admit this, but I was never good at money management. I thought I\nwas, but looking back now, I realize how bad I was at managing money. I\nthought I was frugal in principle, or because I was a savvy entrepreneur. But in\ntruth, I was frugal in my businesses because it was forced upon me.\nWhen I started my first company, a computer network integrator (today it would\nbe called a managed service provider), I had no money. I was able to sell,\nservice, run my office—I could do all that stuff with practically no money\nbecause I didn’t have any. As the business grew, I started to spend. The more I\nmade, the more I spent, and I believed that all expenditures were necessary. We\nneeded better equipment, a better office (an unfinished basement is no place for\na business). I brought on people to do the work so I could sell more. Every step\nforward in sales growth required an equal step up in my infrastructure, human\nresources, grade-A office space or whatever (all fancy terms for expenses).\nAfter losing it all, I discovered that I work with whatever is put in front of me.\nGive me a hundred dollars and I will make it happen. Give me a hundred grand\nand I will make it happen. And while a hundred thousand-dollars made it easier\nto make it happen, it also made it way easier to make mistakes. Totally waste a\nfew hundred dollars when you have a hundred thousand at your disposal, and\nyou feel nothing. Totally waste a few hundred bucks, when you only have a few\nhundo to your name, and you feel that pain fast and hard.\nLooking back at my companies, I realized that I grew them quickly but still\nsurvived check-to-check, only making the real money when I sold them. As my\nincoming cash increased (the darker line on Figure 2), my expenses increased at\na similar rate (lighter line). The only time I would have a profit was when\nincome jumped up and I didn’t have time to spend at the same rate. However, I\nwould quickly ramp up my expenses to serve my “new level of sales.” Then\nsales would settle back down, or drop, while my new level of expenses remained\nhigher. Losses accumulated. The desperate need to sell more, faster, increased.\nI muted the television and began to connect the dots. I wondered, “If I reduce the\n‘plate size’ of my business’s operating account, will I spend differently?”\nLooking back at my past behavior, the answer came quickly. Yes, I would. So\nrather than try to curb my spending habit, I would create the experience of\nhaving less cash on hand than I actually had. How did I know this would work?\nBecause it already works for millions of people, with every paycheck—think\n401K deductions.\nExcited, I realized that, as with a 401K, if I were truly going to believe that the\nmoney I had left over in the bank after reducing my deposits from revenue (my\nsmall plate) was all I had to work with, whatever money I took off the top would\nhave to go into a separate account that would not be easy for me to see, let alone\naccess. Investment accounts charge penalties for early withdrawals to dissuade\ninvestors from drawing from their accounts, and I needed something similar in\nplace to stop me from borrowing from the separate account.\nBut what would I do with the “other money?” Could I use it to— shock of\nshocks—pay myself a salary? Pay my taxes?\nHey. Hey wait. Wait one stinkin’ minute. Could I actually set aside some of it\nfor profit—before I paid bills?\nAnd that’s when it hit me—what if I took my profit first?\nFor a guy who built two businesses on top line (revenue focused) thinking, this\nwas a revelation. At 3:00 a.m., it sounded like crazy talk. Who would have the\naudacity to take profit first?\nMe.\nWHAT THE DIET INDUSTRY KNOWS ABOUT GROWING A\nHEALTHY BUSINESS\nA 2012 report by Koert Van Ittersum and Brian Wansink in the Journal of\nConsumer Research identifies the average plate size in America as having grown\n23% between the years 1900 and 2012, from 9.6 inches to 11.8 inches. Running\nthe math, the article explains that, should this increase in plate size encourage an\nindividual to consume just fifty more calories per day, that person would put on\nan extra five pounds of weight… each year. Year after year, that adds up to a\nvery chunky monkey.\nBut using smaller plates is just one factor. A Twinkie on a small plate is still a\nTwinkie.\nThere is more to a healthy diet, based on four core principles of weight loss and\nnutrition. These four principles are exactly the same foundation for business\nhealth.\n1. Use Small Plates – Using smaller plates starts a chain reaction.\nWhen you use a small plate, you get smaller portions, which means\nyou take in fewer calories. When you take in fewer calories than you\nnormally would, you start to lose weight.\n2. Serve Sequentially – Eat the vegetables, rich in nutrients and\nvitamins, first. If you leave them to eat last, you will rarely finish your\nvegetables. They’ll just sit there piled up on the side of the plate.\n3. Remove Temptation – Remove any temptation from where you\neat. People are driven by convenience. If when you’re hungry, junk\nfood is easily accessible, you’re more likely to eat it. If you don’t have\nany junk food in the house, you’re probably not going to run out to the\nstore to get it. (That would mean putting on pants.) You’re going to eat\nthe healthy food you stocked, instead. My weakness is Chocodiles:\nTwinkies covered in dark chocolate and wrapped in love. Fortunately,\nthey stopped making them. But if one sneaked into my house, even if\nit had expired in 1972, I would devour that delicious elixir of love and\nmonounsaturated fats. Now, I always make sure I have healthy options\nwith me, and the junk is locked away.\n4. Enforce a Rhythm – Don’t eat when you’re hungry; it is already\ntoo late, and you will binge. Instead, eat frequently so that you never\nget hungry. You will actually consume fewer calories this way.\nProfit First is a simple, “small plate” diet philosophy. In the Introduction I\nshared the basic formula of Profit First and how it differs from the accounting\nmethod most businesses use.\nThe old profitas-“leftovers” formula (what I like to call the Frankenstein\nFormula):\nSales – Expenses = Profit\nThe new Profit First Formula:\nSales – Profit = Expenses\nWhat you are about to learn isn’t anything new. It is something I suspect you\nhave been aware of—in full or at least in part—but have never done. It is the\nconcept of “pay yourself first” meets “small plate servings” meets “Grandma’s\nhidden stash of money in the cookie jar” meets your pre-existing natural, human\ntendencies.\nHere’s how Profit First is like a successful diet:\n1. Use Small Plates – When money comes into your main operating\naccount, immediately disperse it into different accounts in\npredetermined percentages. Each of these accounts has a different\nobjective: one is for profit, one for owner pay, another for taxes and\nanother for operating expenses. These are the four basic accounts and\nwhere you should get started, but you will get more advanced in\naccount setup as we move along.\n2. Serve Sequentially – Always, always move money to your Profit\nAccount first, then to your Owner Pay Account and then to your Tax\nAccount, with what remains to expenses. Always in that order. No\nexceptions. Move it, stash it and let it accumulate. And if there isn’t\nenough money left for expenses? This does not mean you need to pull\nfrom the other accounts. What it does mean is, you can’t afford those\nexpenses and need to get rid of them. This will bring more health to\nyour business than you can ever imagine.\n3. Remove Temptation – Move your Profit Account and other\naccounts out of arm’s reach. Make it really hard and painful to get to\nthat money, thereby removing the temptation to “borrow” (i.e., steal)\nfrom yourself. Use an accountability mechanism to prevent access,\nexcept for the right reason.\n4. Enforce A Rhythm – Do your payables twice a month\n(specifically, on the 10th and 25th). Don’t pay only when money is\npiled up in the account. Get into a rhythm of paying bills twice a\nmonth so you can see how cash accumulates and where the money\nreally goes. This is controlled, recurring and frequent cash flow\nmanagement, not by-the-seat-of-your-pants cash management.\nWhen I started applying this small plate philosophy to my company’s finances, I\nwas doing consulting work and speaking on entrepreneurship. I also applied my\nnew Profit First system to my one surviving investment, Hedgehog\nLeatherworks.\nAt the time, I was putting the finishing touches on my first business book, The\nToilet Paper Entrepreneur, into which I inserted a small section about the\nconcept of Profit First Accounting (PFA). After the book came out I continued to\nrefine the system, exploring and living it, and everything changed. I started\nimplementing it with other entrepreneurs. And it worked—for me, for them and\nfor my readers. I started getting calls from people who had read the book and\ntried basic PFA, creating amazing results. I also decided to drop the “A” from\nPFA—partly because Profit First is not an accounting system (it simply plugs\ninto your accounting system) and partly because, when I heard Facebook used to\nbe called “The Facebook” and dropped the “The” to sound cooler, I thought I\nwould follow suit and drop a word.\nFueled by my passion for entrepreneurship and my determination to be\nprofitable now, not at some indeterminate date in the future, I set about to perfect\nmy system. In that process I discovered other entrepreneurs and business leaders\nwho were running their businesses check-to-check and desperately needed the\nProfit First system. But I also found entrepreneurs and business leaders who had\nbeen implementing a similar system to great success. People like my barber, Lou\nLeone, the second-generation owner of a barbershop that has been profitable\nfrom day one. And Phil Tirone, who, while building his first, highly profitable\nmultimillion-dollar business, continued to rent the same studio apartment until\nhe determined that he had secured enough profit to upgrade—to a one bedroom.\nIn the coming pages, I will share these stories and more: stories about people\nwho are in lockstep with their profits and stories about other folks, like you and\nme, who were giving it their all but still ended up only breaking even on their\nbest days—people who now turn a profit every month and enjoy the fruits of\ntheir labors. People like Jose and Jorge, two entrepreneurs who started using\nProfit First from the first day they discovered it and have not only experienced\nvery respectable growth, but have continuously taken in a 7% to 20% percent\nprofit, month after month.\nYour story isn’t finished yet. Not in the least. It’s time to create your happy,\nkickass chapter.\nACTION STEPS\nGET YOUR BUSINESS PROFIT-READY\nStep 1: Set up the small plates with your bank. You will need four accounts:\nProfit Account, Owner’s Pay Account, Tax Account and Operating Expenses\nAccount.\nYou probably already have one or two accounts with your bank (checking and\nsavings). Keep the checking account as your Operating Expenses Account and\nset up Tax and Profit as savings accounts (these are simply holding bins), with\nOwner’s Pay as another checking account.\nSome banks limit the number of transfers in and out of savings accounts. This\nshouldn’t be a problem, since we will be using a rhythm. However, if your Tax\nor Profit Accounts are checking accounts, that is fine. The goal is not to get a\nlittle extra interest; the goal is to hold money temporarily and remove\ntemptation. Some banks charge fees or have minimum balance requirements.\nDon’t let that deter you. Speak to the bank manager and negotiate the fees and\nrequirements. If the manager is unwilling to negotiate, find a new bank.\nStep 2: Set up two more external savings accounts with a bank other than the\nbank you use for daily operations. One account will be your no-temptation Profit\nAccount. The second will be your no-temptation Tax Account. Set them up with\nthe ability to withdraw money directly from the respective savings accounts in\nyour original bank.\nStep 3: Don’t enable any of the “convenience” options for your two external\naccounts. You don’t need or want to view these accounts online. You don’t want\ncheckbooks for these accounts. You just want to deposit your income and forget\nit… for now.\nCHAPTER THREE: The Naked Truth\nIt’s inevitable. Whenever two or more entrepreneurs are gathered together, one\nof them will ask the “How big is it?” question. It’s always some version of the\nsame—“How big is your business?” It might sound like, “How many employees\ndo you have?” Or, “How many territories do you cover?” Or, if you’re one of\nthose straight-to-the-point types (like a few of my classmates at the high school\nreunion), you might even be so bold as to ask, “How much did you take in last\nyear?” However it’s phrased, I hear some version of the “How big is it?”\nquestion wherever I go—it’s like a law of the entrepreneurial (and porn)\ncommunity!\nMany years ago, I joined a global entrepreneurial organization to learn from\nsuccessful, more experienced business leaders from all over the country. At one\nof our meetings, I met my buddy Phil Tirone, founder of 720CreditScore.com.\nPhil made his first fortune in the mortgage lending industry in California, so he\nknows a thing or two about real wealth. Not the top line, or the outward\nappearance. The bottom line. The actual take home money. The naked truth.\n“When you get a loan, you take down your pants. You can’t hide anything,” Phil\ntold me as we enjoyed iced coffee outside his Phoenix home, staring at\nCamelback Mountain in the distance.\n“There are things that people don’t want to talk about. You don’t want to talk\nabout your lack of profit. You don’t want to talk about putting a second\nmortgage on your home to help run your business. You surely don’t want to\nadmit to being the guy that has five times more credit card debt than the average\nfamily in our debtors’ nation. After fourteen years of seeing entrepreneurs live\nlives that are a bunch of lies, I look at the concept of wealth with such a skeptical\neye.”\nPhil went on to explain that, more than just hiding the truth of their financial\nsituations, people aren’t just kidding the world around them; they’re kidding\nthemselves. “I did a loan one time for a guy who had a car payment of fortythree hundred per month. He said to me, ‘One day, when you’re successful,\nyou’ll have a car payment like this.’ I just smiled. This is what I’m supposed to\naspire to? Everyone’s perception of wealth is a joke.”\nIt was with this skepticism that Phil walked into the first global entrepreneur\nmeeting, and the second, and the third, hoping to connect with entrepreneurs\nwho, like him, cared about the bottom line. As usual, all he heard was the same\nquestion over and over again. “How big is it?”\n“All of the conversations were about revenue. Even the first conversation you\nand I had, Mike. It’s bullshit. It’s total bullshit,” Phil said.\n“Who cares about revenue? So you’re running a twenty or fifty million-dollar\ncompany. You’re living in a crap apartment, dude! You’ve got nothing in your\naccounts! The bank owns that car in the driveway. The credit card company\nowns your furniture. Your elderly parents paid for your vacation. Are you\nkidding me? What about profit? It makes no logical sense.”\nIt’s true. At our entrepreneur meetings there was little talk of profit, and many\npeople in the room were counting on the sale of their businesses to finally cash\nin on their perceived success. When someone couldn’t cover payroll that month,\nthey would say they just needed one big project, or one new client, or an investor\nto swoop in. It’s a common refrain among check-to- check entrepreneurs. One\nmore big sale. One new client. Someone to just throw a lot of money at them.\nThese entrepreneurs were giving it everything they had to just survive, with one\neye on the emergency exit sign.\nI may not have been actively looking for an exit strategy while I ran my first two\nbusinesses, but it was the sale of those businesses that gave me actual wealth—\nand “permission” to act like an idiot. Would I have had the money to buy an\nexpensive “stable” (yes, I used the obnoxious term) of cars and invest in poorly\nplanned start-ups if I hadn’t sold my business? Nope. It doesn’t matter how\nmuch money you have coming in, if you’re only focused on growth, you aren’t\ngoing to have much to show for your “big” business.\nThe exit strategy you’re banking on? It rarely happens. My experience was the\nexception, partly due to my being in the right place at the right time. Buyers,\ninvestors, vendors and clients, too, are attracted to healthy businesses. Strong\nbusinesses. But that seems to be a rarity nowadays. Doesn’t it?\nTop line thinking (focusing on income) goes way beyond business. It’s definitely\npart of American culture, this emphasis on size. Bigger is better. More, more,\nmore. Grow! Grow! Grow! Heck, I even wrote a book about how to do it.\nAs I said in the introduction to The Pumpkin Plan, I stand by my method for\ngrowing niche-dominating businesses that lead to giant success. But we can’t\nsustain that growth—or enjoy the fruits of our labors—if we keep putting profit\nat the bottom of our to-do list. Are you really going to keep struggling as you\nwait for that one big sale, that one big contract, that one big payoff that will\nerase all of your debt, get you back in the black and allow you to finally cut\nyourself a big fat check? It rarely happens and, when it does, the money seems to\nevaporate fast. It’s a bit like asking Santa Claus for a million dollars, knowing\nfull well that he’s just a drunk guy in a red suit working at the mall (and for\nGod’s sake get off his lap).\nI say we start a movement, right here and right now, to replace that tired old\nmisguided question about size and replace it with this one: “How healthy is your\nbusiness?” I’m serious—I can envision that question on t-shirts, hats, maybe\nsomeone (hint: you, not me) even tattooing a questionable area of his body with\nthe slogan. Better yet, how about a blimp flying over Wall Street? That’s how\nbig a deal this is.\nIf you spend one more second worrying about the size of your business while\ncompromising a strong bottom line, your business is unhealthy at best. More\nlikely your business is dying a slow death. Big business is great, but only if there\nare healthy profits. Small is great too, but only if there are healthy profits.\nMedium is great, but only if there are profits there, too. You get the picture,\nGoldilocks.\nSo, from this very second forward, ask only one question of yourself. Ask only\none question of your entrepreneurial friends. Ask only one question of any\nbusiness owner.\nHow healthy is your business?\nAre you eating first, or are you surviving on leftovers, or worse— scraps from\nthe garbage can in the alley?\nBy the end of this chapter, you’ll answer that question; and whether your\nbusiness is dying or just a little queasy, we are going to get it back to full health.\nI don’t care how much your business is struggling financially, the fact that you\nare still in business means we can turn it around. Now, when people ask you\nhow business is going, you will respond with, “Healthy. Things are very, very\nhealthy!” And you won’t be lying to them or yourself. You can even get naked\nto prove it.\nTHE (ALMOST) INSTANT ASSESSMENT\nWhether your business is simply not as profitable as you would like it to be or is\nin full cardiac arrest, I need you to be willing to keep your eyes wide open. In\norder for Profit First to work, you need to come to this with no blinders on.\nAs you complete the Instant Assessment, remember that different businesses\nhave different setups. I’ll help you get to the perfect numbers for your specific\nbusiness in the next chapter. For now, know that, while the numbers I provide in\nthis chapter are ballpark numbers, they are a surprisingly effective way to get\nstarted, and you may be surprised at how accurate this Instant Assessment really\nis.\nFigure 3 is the Profit First Instant Assessment form. Complete the form right\nnow! You can write right in this book (or, if you are on an iPad or Kindle or\nsome other reader and don’t want to replace the screen, you can download a\nprintable copy from the Resources section at Mike Michalowicz.com.)\n1. In the Actual column, enter your Top Line Revenue for the last twelve full\nmonths. This is your total revenue, and you should be able to pull this number\ndirectly from your accounting system.\n2. If you are a manufacturer or retailer, or if most of your sales are derived from\nthe resale or assembly of inventory, put the cost of materials (not labor) for the\nlast twelve full months in the Material & Subs cell.\n3. If subcontractors deliver most of your services, put the cost of the\nsubcontractors for these twelve months in the Material & Subs cell.\n(Subcontractors are people who work for you, but have the ability to work\nautonomously and to work for others. You don’t pay them on payroll, you pay\nthem their project fee, commission or hourly rate, and they handle their taxes,\nbenefits, etc. themselves.) In some cases you will have both materials and\nsubcontractor costs (think home construction). In that case, put the cumulative\namount of these two costs in the Material & Subs cell. Remember to only put\nyour materials and subcontracts here, but not labor costs for your own people.\n4. If you are a service company and most of your services are provided by your\nemployees (you included), put an n/a symbol in the Material & Subs section.\n5. Now subtract your Material & Subs number from your Top Line Revenue to\ncalculate your Real Revenue. If you put an n/a in the Material & Subs section,\njust copy the Top Line Revenue number to the Real Revenue cell.\n6. The goal is to get you to your Real Revenue number. This is the real money\nyour company makes. For the other stuff—subs, materials, etc.—you may make\na margin, but it isn’t the core driver of profitability because you have little\ncontrol over it. This can be a real wake-up moment for entrepreneurs. That real\nestate agency that does $5,000,000 in annual revenue and has a couple dozen\nagents (subcontractors) taking $4,000,000 in commissions is really a $1,000,000\nbusiness that manages real estate agents making $4,000,000, not a $5,000,000\nbusiness. The $3,000,000 a year staffing firm that bills out subcontractors to do\nwork, and pays those subs $2,500,000, is really a $500,000 business. The\naccounting firm that bills out $2,000,000 in annual fees and has an in-house staff\nthat does almost all the work has Real Revenue of $2,000,000 a year. The Real\nRevenue number is a simple, fast way to put all companies on equal footing\n(their Real Revenue numbers).\nReal Revenue is different from Gross Profit, in that Real Revenue is your Total\nRevenue minus materials and subcontractors used to create and deliver the\nservice or product. Gross Profit is Total Revenue minus materials,\nsubcontractors and any of your employee’s time used to create and deliver the\nservice or product. It is a subtle difference but a critically important one. Gross\nProfit includes a portion of your employees’ time. But the thing is this: You will\ngenerally pay your employees for their time whether you have a bad sales day or\na good one. You will likely pay them the same salary if they fix a car\ntransmission in four hours or five. So, to simplify things, we categorize any\nemployee that you have, full or part time, as a cost of the business operations,\nnot as a cost of the good sold.\n7. Now that we know your Real Revenue, write down your actual profit from the\nlast twelve months in the Profit cell. This is the cumulative profit you have\nsitting in the bank, or have distributed to yourself (and/or partners) as a bonus on\ntop of—but not to supplement—your salary. If you think you have a profit but it\nis not in the bank and was never distributed to you as a bonus, this means you\ndon’t really have a profit. (If it turns out that you have less profit than you\nthought you would, it’s likely you used it to pay down debt from previous years.\nOr maybe you are attempting an Enron re-make.)\n8. In the Owner’s Pay cell, put down how much you paid yourself (and any other\nowners of the business) these past twelve months in regular payroll distributions,\nnot profit distributions.\n9. In the Tax cell, put down how much money you have paid in taxes over the\nlast twelve months, plus any money you have already reserved for taxes.\n10. In the Operating Expenses cell, add up the total expenses you paid for the\nlast twelve months—everything except your profits, owner’s pay, taxes and any\nmaterials and subs that you have already accounted for.\n11. Double-check your work by adding up your profit, owner’s pay, taxes and\noperating expenses to see if you get your Real Revenue number. If you don’t get\nthis number, something is wrong with your calculations. Go fix it. Then, add\nyour Real Revenue to the Material & Subs costs and you should get the Top\nLine Revenue number. Make sure it all squares out.\n12. Next, enter the profit percentage in the PF % column based upon your Real\nRevenue Range. Use the percentages in Figure 4. I call these percentages TAPs\n(Target Allocation Percentages), the percentage of each deposit that will be\nallocated to different elements of our business.\nFor example, if your Real Revenue for the last twelve months is $722,000, you\nshould use column C. If your business has $225,000 in Real Revenue, use\nColumn A. If you run a division (or have your own company) that does\n$40,000,000, use column F.\n13. In the PF $ column, copy the Real Revenue number from your actual\ncolumn. Then multiply that Real Revenue number by the PF % for each row and\nwrite down the number in the corresponding PF $ cell. These are your target PF\ndollar amounts for each category. Welcome to the moment of truth. (I hope we\ncan still be friends.)\n14. In the Bleed column, take your Actual number and subtract the PF $ number.\nThis is very likely to result in a negative number. It is your bleed, the amount\nyou need to make up. Negative means you are bleeding out money in these\nsections. Sometimes it is in just one category with a problem, but in most cases\nbusinesses are bleeding out in the Profit, Owner’s Pay and Tax Accounts and\nhave a positive number (meaning excess) in Operating Expenses. In other words,\nwe are paying too little in profit, owner salaries, and taxes, and paying too much\nin operating expenses.\n15. In the final column, The Fix, put either “increase” or “decrease” next to each\ncategory. If the number in the Bleed section is a negative number, put “increase”\nin the corresponding Fix cell, because we need to increase our contribution to\nthis category to correct the Bleed. Conversely, if it is a positive number in the\nBleed section, put “decrease” in the Fix cell, since this is a category where we\nneed to spend less money in order to fix it.\nFigure 5 is a completed example from a law firm to which I just introduced this\nprocess: The Instant Assessment reveals a few (painful) things. This business is\nnot nearly profitable enough—it should be filling the profit coffers by $118,000\nmore every year. At $5,000 in the Profit Account, this is basically a break-even\nbusiness. One bad month and this company is going down.\nThe two owners are taking a combined salary of $190,000, which is way too\nmuch for a business of this size. The owners are likely living a bigger lifestyle\nthan the business can afford, and they need to cut their salaries by $67,000.\nAs the business gets healthier, the taxes will increase. (More taxes, as painful as\nthey are to pay, are a sign of a healthy business—the more you make, the more\nyou pay… until you make so much you lobby politicians and pay nothing. Don’t\nget me started.) And those Operating Expenses are too high, to the tune of more\nthan $141,000.\nLooking at this Instant Assessment, it’s obvious what this company’s leaders\nneed to do to make their business healthy: Cut owners’ salaries and cut operating\ncosts, possibly including staff. It will require courage, and it is going to be\npainful.\nThe Instant Assessment brings clarity fast, and it can be a rude awakening. No\nmore putting things off. No more hoping that big client, big check or big\nanything will save you from the day-to-day panic. We know exactly what we\nneed to do.\nA financially healthy company is a result of a series of small daily financial\nwins, not one big moment. Profitability isn’t an event; it’s a habit.\nWHY PERCENTAGES?\nWhat if I told you I knew of a successful bikini model and fitness trainer who\nweighs 205 pounds? You would assume she was seriously overweight, right?\nHow could she be a bikini model? Easy. She’s six foot eight! Amazon Eve is the\ntallest bikini model in the world and, I’m telling you, she’s ripped. (Google her.)\nHer weight is ideal for her height. Fitness is relative. Health is relative. So are\nnumbers.\nIn this book I use the phrase “top line” thinking, which is when you focus on\nrevenue, revenue first and foremost, with profit as an afterthought. Top line\nthinking is dangerous because numbers are relative. You may have a million in\nrevenue, but that’s a whole lot of nothing if your expenses and debt load is also\nseven figures. At $500K you might view your top line as meager compared to\nother businesses in your industry, but if you’re pulling in eighty percent in pay\nand profit, that is far from meager. That’s gorgeous. Super model gorgeous. And\nif your business is showing fifty million in revenue, but pulling in two percent in\npay and profit, that’s ugly, my friend. Frankenstein, ugly. (And we all know how\nugly that is.) So, rather than focus on actual numbers alone, look at percentages.\nPercentages show the relationship, giving you an accurate picture of what’s\nreally happening with your business.\nHOW DID I DETERMINE THESE NUMBERS AND PERCENTAGES?\nThese are typical ranges that I have found while working with countless\ncompanies over the years and in running my own. The percentages aren’t\nperfect, but they are an excellent starting point. And they represent what I have\nfound to be very healthy numbers. But here is the deal—they may not work for\nyou perfectly, but that is okay because these percentages are your target, what\nyou will move toward. We are going to move in small steps. More on that soon,\nbut here are the deets behind the percentages.\nWhen a company is doing less than $250,000 in revenue it typically has one\nemployee: you. You are the key employee and usually the only employee (with\nsome contractors, part-timers, or maybe possibly one full-timer). Many\nfreelancers are at this stage and if they elect to stay there (just them and no\nemployees) they should be able to increase the profit and pay percentages even\nmore than what I have listed, because they don’t have the expense of employees\nor the need to incur the expenses necessary to support multiple employees.\nAt $250K to $500K, you likely have employees. Basic systems will be necessary\n(like a shared CRM for your team), equipment, etc., plus you will need to pay\nyour people, so operating expenses increase. Owner’s Pay adjusts down (and\nwill continue to) as you take your first step in being a little less employee and a\nlittle more shareholder, when other people start to do the work, and you get the\nbenefit of the profits via your distributions.\nAt $500K to $1M, the growth trend and patterns continue with more systems and\nmore people. Focus on increasing profits because, for so many businesses, the\ngrowth from $1M to $5M is the hardest. You want a little reserve.\nFrom $1M to $5M, systems are no longer added because they are nice to have;\nnow systems become absolutely mandatory. You can’t keep it all in your head\nany more. Often the biggest investment into the business needs to happen at this\ntime, as all the knowledge in your head needs to be converted to systems and\nprocesses and check lists. This means larger allocations must be put toward\nOperating Expenses. This is when you are no longer doing most of the work; this\nis when, if your business is to grow, a significant portion of your time is spent\nworking on the business (not in it), and the rest of your time is spent selling the\nbig projects.\nAt $5M to $10M, typically a management team enters a company to bring it to\nthe next stage, and a clear second tier of management starts to form. The founder\nstarts more and more to focus on her special strengths. The owner is on a\nconsistent payroll, and the majority of her take home income is from the\nprofitability of the company, not the salary she takes.\nAt $10M to $50M, a business will often stabilize and achieve predictable\ngrowth. The founder’s income is almost entirely made up of profit distributions.\nOwners’ salaries are relative to their roles, but typically are insignificant.\nBusinesses of this size can leverage efficiency in big ways to maximize\nprofitability.\nRUDE AWAKENING\nYou might remember that during my “rebuilding” period, I wrote my first book,\nThe Toilet Paper Entrepreneur; the foundation of which was a series of\nprinciples I used to start my businesses. Chief among these principles was\nfrugality—I wholeheartedly believed that any entrepreneur could start a business\nwith little or no seed money and grow that business no matter what they had in\nthe bank. The book is full of tips for saving money while launching and running\na business, and since its publication I’ve heard from thousands of entrepreneurs\nwho followed the advice (or a variant thereof) while starting or operating their\nown businesses.\nAnd let me tell you, I didn’t just spout off about frugality. After my spending\ncraze, after my come-to-Jesus moment (if Jesus were named “near bankruptcy”),\nI went back to my roots. Way back. Not because I had to, this time, but because I\nwanted to. I made it my mission to get what I needed for my business on the\ncheap and took pride in doing so. My office space cost a mere $1000 per month\n—peanuts compared to my previous $14,000 a month digs. I got my gently-used\nconference room furniture for a whopping 75% discount. My dry erase board\nwas homemade, with white board material used in showers, dental floss and\nsome car wax. (Top that, MacGyver!)\nSo imagine my surprise when I ran my own assessment on my business and\ndiscovered that, despite my frugal superpowers, I was still bleeding out. It is not\nan exaggeration to say I was shocked to discover this. “How much cheaper can I\nget this stuff?” I thought, beyond frustrated.\nThen I realized—duh. It wasn’t how much I was spending on expense line items.\nThe problem was, I shouldn’t have been spending anything on some of those line\nitems. For example, I didn’t really need an office space. I wasn’t seeing clients\nor greeting customers. I was writing a book and building a speaking career,\nwhich meant I spent a lot of time alone, on the road and in phone and Skype\nmeetings. My subcontractors could just as easily do their work from home.\nTruth was, I wanted an office space because it made me feel legitimate. And let\nme tell you, after my piggy bank moment, I needed to feel that. But the bottom\nline was, I couldn’t keep it up if I wanted to turn a profit every month. So I\nsublet my office space and found a sweet deal at a cookie factory—free office\nand meeting space from a trusted, long-time friend. I cut expense line items\nacross the board until I stopped the bleeding and watched my business and profit\ngrow. An added bonus was free cookies. And when I say added bonus, I mean it\nadded about five pounds around my waist. So… not really a bonus, after all.\nFor some people, the Instant Assessment brings about a rude awakening that is\nfar more devastating than mine. I’d already been through the wringer, so\nrealizing I had to cut a few line items was a shock, but not a big deal. Cutting\ncost has become almost enjoyable. It has become strategic in a way. How can I\nachieve the same or better with less or no cost? For Debbie Horovitch, whose\nstory I shared with you in the introduction, the rude awakening led to a near-\nbreakdown with a total stranger (me—so, you know, a “very handsome young\nman,” according to my mom). It led to Debbie feeling like a fool.\nI have applied the Instant Assessment to countless businesses, and the reactions\nvary from, “Really? I can do that?” to “Who the hell do you think you are, Mike,\ntelling me where my business should be? You know nothing about my unique\nindustry!” to buckling knees and tears streaming down people’s faces. It’s hard\nto face the harsh reality that your business is worse off than you thought it was.\nBut now you know, and knowledge is power. Now we can fix it.\nYou are not a fool. You have done nothing wrong, and you have nothing to be\nashamed of. You have this book in your hands. You are discovering the truth and\nanother way to get where you want to go. You are no longer asking, “How can I\nmake my business bigger?” You are asking, “How can I make my business\nhealthier?”\nWHAT IF YOUR BUSINESS IS BRAND NEW\nHow does Profit First work if you just launched your business and have no\nrevenue? Should you wait until you have some to start using Profit First? Heck,\nno. Starting with squat, with your whole business future ahead of you is actually\nthe best time to start using Profit First. Why? Because it allows you to form a\npowerful habit right from the get-go, when your business is forming and,\nperhaps more importantly, prevents you from developing bad financial habits\nthat can be difficult to break.\nA baby is a poor indication of what a person will look like as an adult; the same\nis true for a brand new business. You may end up serving a different type of\nclient than you plan to serve right now. I suspect the founder of Ugg, who\ninitially made the popular line for surfers, never imagined teenage girls would\nbecome his primary market. Also, in the early stages of building a business, you\nneed to spend as much time as possible on the selling and the doing; systems and\nprocesses come later. For these reasons, it’s best not to worry about getting the\nexact right percentages for your business.\nSimply use the percentages in the Instant Assessment for your target allocations,\nbut start at 1% allocation for the Profit Account, 50% for Owner’s Pay and 15%\nfor the Tax Account. Use quarterly adjustments to step up to higher percentages\nand nudge your business closer to the TAPs recommended in this book. And as\nfor the advanced Profit First strategies I share in the end of the book—don’t\nworry about any of that until your business has been active for at least a year.\nThe goal for new businesses is to form the basic core good Profit First habit and\nthen spend every other waking second getting your baby off the ground.\nACTION STEP\nCOMPLETE THE INSTANT ASSESSMENT\nStep 1 (the one and only step): This entire chapter is really one big action step,\nso if you have not yet completed an Instant Assessment on your business, do it\nnow. Can you get a lot out of this book if you table this exercise for when you\nhave more time or feel up to facing reality? Sure. Will you get the most out of\nreading this book and see results quickly if you don’t? Nope. So stop right now\nand do it.\nPLEASE READ THIS NOW\nIf you are feeling overwhelmed, bad about yourself and the choices you’ve\nmade, or angry about the numbers you came up with in your Instant Assessment,\nthere is something I want you to know:\nYou are normal.\nIf you are having trouble facing the rest of this book, that’s okay. Stop now and\ncome back to it when you feel ready to face it. But do this one thing: set up a\nProfit Account at a separate bank and, every time you make a deposit, move one\npercent into that account. I know it’s “peanuts” and you may think the amount is\ntoo small to make an impact on your business, but that is the reason you’re going\nto keep the profit allocation percentage low. You can run your business as you\nalways have, and you won’t feel a thing, but you will start the habit that will\nchange your business forever. Soon enough, the feeling of being overwhelmed,\nthe anger and frustration, will fade as your new profit habit builds. Then you can\ncrack this book again and dig in to the rest of the Profit First system.\nCHAPTER FOUR: Choose Your Own Adventure\nWhen I was a kid, I loved reading Choose Your Own Adventure books (and quite\nfrankly, I’ll still dig into an R.A.\nMontgomery book if it crosses my path). You know, the interactive books with a\nmessage at the end of each chapter that says something like: “If you want to take\nthe path through the woods, turn to page 51. If you want to take the boat, turn to\npage 80.”\nHere’s your chance to relive a part of your childhood—you get to choose which\nProfit First adventure you want to have next. The only difference between this\nand the classic Choose Your Own Adventure books is, no matter which page you\nturn to, as long as you follow the Profit First system you will be victorious.\nSimply choose a path that fits your needs right now. But whichever path you\nchoose, the ending is the same no matter what: perpetual profit.\nLet’s get to it. Time to pick your direction in your adventures in profit. You put\nyour sword back in its sheath. You raise your torch high, illuminating the room.\nA large pile of cash sits in front of you, ready for the taking. You choose what\nhappens next:\n1. You are the type who wants to continue on with this adventure,\nnow. So you quickly scoop up the pile of cash, stuff it into your\nbackpack and draw your sword, ready for the next challenge. (If you\nwant to start implementing Profit First right this second using your\nInstant Assessment percentages, turn to Chapter 5.)\n2. You are the type who accounts for the details. Is that a black widow\nspider crawling amongst the bills? And what’s that slimy, slithering\nthing peering at you from the corner of the room? Is it a snake—or\nworse, an IRS agent?\nYou carefully count and stack every single dollar, write out a receipt\nand place the money securely in your backpack. The next adventure\nwill surely present itself, but for now you’ll cross every T and dot\nevery I. (If you want to master the nuances of the Instant Assessment\nand come up with percentages that are perfectly suited to your\nbusiness, then continue reading this chapter.)\nNote: There are a lot of numbers in this chapter. If you choose option 2\nand make it through this chapter alive, tweet me a selfie.\nThere is no wrong choice. You may want to jump right in and come back later to\ntweak your percentages. Or you may want to come up with a customized\nassessment so that you don’t have to come back later. Either way, as long as\nyou’re actually working the Profit First system, you’re winning.\nGETTING DOWN TO THE NITTY-GRITTY\nThe Instant Assessment is based on ranges. Every business is slightly different\n(though your business and your industry are not nearly as unique as you may\nthink). The numbers you came up with in the Instant Assessment won’t be\nperfect, but they are probably close to what you’ll end up with after a more\ndetailed assessment.\nBefore we dig in, I want to address two common problems entrepreneurs face\nwhen they decide to start following the Profit First system—and they do not go\nhand in hand.\nFirst, some entrepreneurs make the mistake of getting trapped in the details,\nspending hours, days, weeks or longer perfecting their percentages before they\ndo anything. Worse, some entrepreneurs who get stuck in the minutiae never get\naround to doing anything. It’s our old nemesis: analysis paralysis. In this\nchapter, we get down to the nitty-gritty; but if at any time you think you are lost\nin a research and percentage-tweaking rabbit hole, stop and move on to the next\nchapter. Perfectionism kills every dream—better to just start.\nOn the other hand, if you’re like me, you might make the common mistake of\ntaking action too big and too fast. I’m the type who starts before I have all of the\ninformation because most of the learning occurs in the doing, anyway. But I put\nsuccess at risk when I go into a situation ill-prepared. In those cases, my ego\nblames the system when mistakes were simply due to the fact that I didn’t put in\nthe necessary preparation.\nI’ve seen entrepreneurs kickstart their Profit First system by taking a profit\npercentage of twenty percent immediately. They say, “This is so simple. I get it.\nBammo! Twenty percent! I’m done. Next problem.” Not so fast, Chiefy. This is\na classic mistake, one I’ve made myself. Going full-throttle Profit First on the\nfirst day is like donating five gallons of blood at your first blood drive. You\nknow what would happen if you tried to do that? You would die. The body has\nless than two gallons of blood pumping through it, so you’d keel over way\nbefore you reached your five-gallon goal anyway. However, there is a way to\nreach that goal in a safe way. If we donate small amounts over time, eventually\nwe will donate five gallons—cumulatively.\nIf you hoard most of the food at the table, you’re not leaving any fuel for your\nbusiness. Remember, your business, not you, is now living off of the leftovers.\nSo make sure the share you take leaves enough for your business to continue to\nthrive. Rather than go with one extreme—too slow or too fast—let’s just meet\nsomewhere in the middle.\nThe key to successful Profit First implementation lies in stringing together a\nseries of many small steps in a repeating pattern. So take it easy.\nWhile you slowly start to build up your Profit First muscle, we are also going to\nget you into a simple, repeating pattern. All music has a rhythm. Rhythm is what\nmoves the music forward, and moves you. Otherwise it would just be random\nnoise, and you would never be moved by it. Entrepreneurs typically manage\ntheir money in an erratic, noisy rhythm that causes confusion and panic. But by\nthe end of the next chapter, we will get you into a simple rhythm that will give\nyou clarity and control over your financials.\nLet’s dig in.\nYOUR PROFIT TARGET ALLOCATION PERCENTAGES (TAPS)\nThe Instant Assessment is a starting point for all of your Target Allocation\nPercentages (TAPs). TAPs are the goals we have set to distribute to each account\nbased on percentages. We may want to ultimately be tucking away 20% of our\naccumulated deposits; if so, 20% would be the TAP for Profit. We won’t\nnecessarily start there, but we will build to it.\nNow you need to do a little bit of research to set more specific target numbers.\nThere are a few ways to approach this:\n1. Research public companies: Look at the financial reports public\ncompanies are required to make available. Do a quick Internet search\nusing the term “financial market overview” and you will find dozens\nof websites that report the financials for public companies. Look up at\nleast five companies in your industry, or a similar industry. If you\ndon’t find your niche, try expanding. For instance, if you find no\npublic DJ companies, expand to entertainment companies and select\nfive that come close. (Tip: My preference is Marketwatch. com for\nthese reports, because the site is easy to navigate. You might also try\nYahoo! Finance and Google Finance.)\nFor our purposes, look up the income statements for the last three to\nfive years. If you really want to dig in, check out the balance sheets\nand cash flow statements for these companies, too.\nFor each year, divide the net income (profit) number by the total\nsales/revenue number. Do this for each year and then come up with the\naverage. This is how you find the profit percentage for any public\ncompany. Do this for each of the five public companies you look at,\nand you will find the overall industry profit average.\nUse that overall industry profit average as your Profit TAP.\n2. Review your tax returns for the last three to five years and\ndetermine your most profitable year (based on percentages, not on\ndollar amounts). Why do we want the percentage? Because a billiondollar company that only reports a million dollars in profit is in big\ntrouble. Even if they only had one bad day, a million bucks wouldn’t\nbe enough to bail them out. But a five million-dollar company that\nreports a million in profits is kicking butt and taking names. That lil’\nol’ company spits at bad days.\n3. Or, the easiest way, just pick your profit percentage number based\non your projected revenue for this year, using revenue for the last\ntwelve months from the Instant Assessment form you filled out for\nChapter 3. (You did fill it out, right?) Remember, the form is also\navailable for free download in the Resources section at\nMikeMichalowicz.com.\nIf more than half the stuff your company sells comes from materials rather than\nlabor or software—as happens with manufacturers, restaurants and retailers—\nuse the gross profit (sometime called gross income) as the Real Revenue\nnumber. Gross profit is calculated somewhat similarly to how I suggest you\ndetermine your Real Revenue, and you need to evaluate your business based on\nthat. Whenever you run the numbers for your business, or evaluate others, you\nwill always base it on Real Revenue (gross profit).\nSince at this point your Profit Account will fund your profit distributions and\nserve as your rainy day fund, you’ll want your Profit Percentage to grow past\nfive percent quickly. If you save five percent of your company’s annual income,\nfor example, that represents about twenty-one days of operating cash, which\nwould help you keep your business afloat if your income were to plummet. (If\nyour income dried up, you would stop contributing to your Profit Account and\nTax Account and stop profit distributions to owners.) Three weeks is not much\ntime to fix the problem, but Armageddon rarely happens. More often, revenue\nslows down over time, and you’ll have at least something coming in during lean\ntimes. Kinda like a “Hangnail-ageddon” instead of an Armageddon. (It’s a bad\njoke, I know, but I like it. So it stays.)\nIf your sales were to stop completely, with not a single deposit coming in, here’s\na good longevity rule of thumb:\n1. 5% profit allocation = 3 weeks of operating cash\n2. 12% profit allocation= 2 months of operating cash\n3. 24% profit allocation = 5 months of operating cash.\nWhy is it that, as the PF percentages basically double, longevity almost triples?\nThe math doesn’t seem to make sense at first glance. But it does make sense.\nThe bigger your PF percentage, the more efficiently you are running your\nbusiness, which means less in operating expenses. So not only do you have more\nsaved up with a higher PF percentage, you spend less, which affords you even\nmore time.\nThe goal is to make your PF as high as possible. However, super-high profit\npercentages are not sustainable. At least not for long, and definitely not if your\nrevenue stays stagnant. The reason for this is, if you can pull off consistently fat\nprofits—say 50% allocated to your Profit Account—and your Operating\nExpenses Account for only 10% of revenue, your competitors will figure out\nwhat you’re doing. Then, to get more business, they will drop prices (they likely\nhave the profit margins to afford it). When that happens, you will have to drop\nprices too in order to stay in business. For competitive sharks, fat margins can be\nlike blood in the water. The only way to keep big margins is to milk them for all\nthey’re worth when you have them and keep innovating to find new ways to\nbump up profitability.\nOWNER’S PAY TAPS\nGone are the days when you paid everyone but yourself and had to support your\nlife with credit cards and loans from the in-laws. Remember, your business is\nsupposed to serve you; you are not in service to your business! No more\nleftovers for you!\nOwner’s Pay is the amount you and the other equity owners take in pay for the\nwork you do. (Equity members of your company who do not work in the\nbusiness just get a profit distribution.) Your salary should be on par with the\ngoing rate for the work you do, in other words—the salary you would have to\npay your replacement.\nThere are two options to consider when choosing your Owner’s Pay TAPs\nnumber. Either:\n1. Take a realistic look at the work you do. If you have a small\ncompany with, say, five employees, you may call yourself the CEO—\nbut that’s just the title on your card. Likely, you are doing a lot of\nother work. You probably spend a lot of time selling, completing\nprojects, handling customers and dealing with HR concerns. In reality,\naround two percent of your time is spent actually doing the job of CEO\n—vision planning, strategic negotiations, acquisitions, reporting to\ninvestors, addressing the media, etc. Determine your salary based on\nwhat you are doing 80% of the time, and what you would reasonably\npay employees to do those jobs.\n2. Evaluate pay for all equity owners who work in the business. Add\nup the salaries that represent your Owner’s Pay draw. The percentage\nof revenue must, at minimum, cover Owner’s Pay draw. Remember,\nyou will likely get raises—maybe even a bonus for a job well done. So\nmake the percentage one-and-a-quarter times the amount you\ndetermine for your salaries, so you can adjust for revenue fluctuations.\nOr, pick the percentage I suggested in the Instant Assessment, based on your\nrevenue range. (Refer to Figure 4.) The money that is transferred into this\naccount is divided among all equity employees. It does not have to be split up\nequally, nor does it have to be split up based on your equity percentages.\nWhy should you have a separate account if you and the other equity owners\nworking in the business are just employees? Because you are the most important\nemployee. If you had to fire people, I suspect you would fire everyone else\nbefore you fired yourself. Think about your very best employee. I’ll bet you take\nextra steps to ensure that you are taking care of her. I’ll bet you would do\neverything in your power to keep your best employees happy, including paying\nthem what they’re worth, right? Well guess what, Bucko! You are your best,\nmost important employee. We must take care of you.\nWhen it comes to pay, different business formations require you to take Owner’s\nPay in different ways. An S -Corp is treated differently than an LLC or a sole\nproprietorship, which are both treated way differently than a C-Corp. The\nOwner’s Pay allocation still works the same way; you just need to work with\nyour accountant to make sure the money flows out properly and legally. (I\nstrongly recommend an accountant who is a certified Profit First Professional,\nmeaning they get this and know exactly how to support your Profit First\nbusiness.)\nWHEN YOUR CURRENT PAY IS LESS THAN THE ASSESSMENT\nI was having dinner with my friend Rodrigo when he told me how his business\ngenerated $350,000 in annual revenue, but he was living on below-minimum\nwage.\nAs a thunderstorm approached in the distance, I took the napkin with the least\namount of salsa stains and jotted down Rodrigo’s numbers. Multiplying his\n$350,000 in Real Revenue by 35% (from the Instant Assessment), I came up\nwith just over $122,000.\n“How many partners work in the business?” I asked. “Me, and one other,” he\nreplied.\nDividing by two, the amount for owner’s pay was a little over $61,000 each, but\nthat was if they were doing the same work, warranting a fifty-fifty split. As we\ndiscussed in the previous section, owner’s pay should represent the work you do.\nWhen I asked Rodrigo for more details about his own pay, he said, “I take\nroughly $30,000 a year, and my partner left to get a full-time job, so he takes\nzero now. We have three full-time employees at $65,000 each per year, and I\nmanage them.”\nI’d like to say I was shocked, but this scenario is all too common. I did wonder\nhow Rodrigo was supporting himself and his family on below-minimum wage. I\nfigured he was using credit cards, family loans and possibly a home refinance to\nsupplement his paltry income.\n“If all three of your employees decided to leave on the same day, what would\nyou do?” I asked.\n“I would do all of the work myself and my partner would come back.”\n“So why don’t you do that?” I asked.\n“Because then I would be stuck doing the work and it would not be able to\ngrow,” Rodrigo explained. “I don’t want to do the work; I want to grow the\nbusiness.”\nRodrigo had the right idea, but he was executing it in the wrong way.\nIn The E-Myth Revisited, the classic must-read book by Michael Gerber, Michael\nexplains that we should work on our business, not in it. (Yes, I call him Michael.\nWe are friends. He calls me Mike and I call him Michael. And occasionally I\ncall him Mike and he calls me Michael. And then we both get confused and start\ntalking to ourselves.)\nThis “on vs. in” philosophy is spot-on, and yet most entrepreneurs have trouble\nexecuting it. Working on the business does not mean hiring a bunch of people to\ndo the work and then spending all the livelong day answering their never-ending\nquestions about how to do the job (the job you used to do). Shifting to a\nmanagerial role just means you are working in your business in a different way\n—and that you have a mongo payroll to cover every two weeks.\nWorking on your business is about building systems. Period. An entrepreneur is\nsomeone who finds the solutions to opportunities and problems and then builds\nsystems to consistently deliver those solutions through other people or things.\nHowever, what Rodrigo and so many entrepreneurs miss is that growing a\ncompany is not an overnight switch from doing all of the work to none of the\nwork. The transition from working in the business to working on the business\nhappens over time—slowly, deliberately, one small step followed by another\nsmall step. (Are you starting to see the theme here?) This is the reasoning behind\nthe Owner’s Pay percentages in the Instant Assessment—larger percentages for\nowners when the company is tiny and smaller percentages as the company\ngrows.\nIn the early days of a company, when annual revenues are below $250,000, you\nare not only the most important employee; you are likely the only employee. If\nyour annual revenue is under $500,000 and you have an employee or two, you\nare still the key employee. And that means you must be doing 90% of the work.\nYou’re bringing home the bacon and frying it up in the pan.\nThe other 10% of the time you spend documenting everything you do so that you\ncan systematize it for your other few employees or contractors to do the work\nwithout your input. Basically, you are a true entrepreneur (building systems)\n10% of the time, and a hardworking, hard-selling employee of your own\ncompany 90% of the time.\nThis is why you get such a big salary in the beginning. No more of this “bottom\nof the bowl” stuff. You can’t live on minimum wage or less. Say it again, once\nmore with feeling: My business serves me; I do not serve my business. Paying\nyourself next to nothing for hard work is servitude.\nAs your annual revenue grows past $500,000, you will transition to spending\nmore time building systems. Now, you’re a systems developer 20% of the time,\na manager 10% of the time and an employee 70% of the time. (Note that the\nbetter you are at creating systems, the less management is required, because the\nrecipe for how to things get done is consistent.)\nAs annual revenue grows past one million, your salary percentage will drop even\nfarther because you will be working less and less in the business and more and\nmore on the business.\nHowever, remember that it is likely you will always work in your business.\nBecause even if you are a master of building systems and spend 80% of your\ntime in that magic zone, you’ll still spend roughly 20% of your time handling the\nbig sales. Almost every entrepreneur to CEO is in charge of the big sale. You bet\nyour bottom dollar Jeff Bezos is in the room when Amazon is closing a hundred\nmillion-dollar deal. And when your big deals are on the table, you will be right\nthere, sitting at its head.\nIronically, getting back in your business is the best way to create systems. And\nas you put the systems in place and your revenue increases to accommodate\nthem, you can slowly plug in great people to implement those great systems.\nThe bottom line is this: Don’t cut your salary to make the numbers work. The\ngoal of every business is health, and that is achieved through efficiency. Your\nmartyr syndrome is not doing anyone any favors; making yourself the sacrificial\nlamb does not promote efficiency, it hinders it.\nYOUR TAX TAPS\nProfit First is not about accounting to the exact penny (that’s what your\nbookkeeper and accountant do). It is about handling your accounting quickly and\neasily, with numbers that are as close to accurate as possible. We work\npercentages off of the Real Revenue number and this is true for all your “small\nplate” accounts.\nThe first step in getting to your Tax TAP is to determine your income tax rate.\nTaxes range all over the place, depending on your amount of personal income\nand corporate profit and the area you live in. As of this writing, many\nentrepreneurs have an average income tax rate of 35% or so; for others it will be\nless, and in some countries is can be 60% or more.\nWhen I traveled to Copenhagen, Denmark, the beauty of the country blew me\naway: the resources they have, and all the “free stuff”—the free healthcare, the\nfree education (including universities), and the free-flowing confidence that they\nlive in the best place in the world, which is kind of funny, because I always\nthought North Korea held that title.\nThen my friend Lori Webb told me that the Danish tax rate is over 60%. I\npractically fell off my chair.\nTaxes vary from country to country, income bracket to income bracket, and\nsurely change everywhere every year (and, I think, in world history, never once\nin our favor). But regardless of what the numbers are, you need to prepare for\nthem.\nOne goal of the Profit First system is that the company takes care of all forms of\ntax responsibility. It’s mandatory that you talk with your accountant so she can\nadvise you on all the ways you and your business will be taxed.\nHere are four different approaches for determining your Tax TAP:\n1. Look at your personal and business tax returns. Add up your taxes\nand then determine the percentage of taxes you paid compared to your\nReal Revenue. Do this again for the prior two years. Looking at your\ntaxes as a percentage of Real Revenue for the last three years will give\nyou a good sense of your ongoing tax responsibility.\n2. From your accountant get your estimated tax responsibility for your\nbusiness, year-to-date (YTD), and then determine your tax percentage\nof your YTD Real Revenue. Better yet, if your accountant is a certified\nProfit First Professional, she can simply tell you the percentage to\nreserve. (For a list of accountants, bookkeepers and other financial\ngurus who are Profit First Professionals, go to the Resources section at\nMikeMichalowicz.com.)\n3. Do a search for “tax rates” + “your country” + “tax year.” For\nexample, “tax rates United States 2013” yielded the following results\non Google:\nTax Rate Schedule Y-1, Internal Revenue Code section 1(a)\n10% on taxable income from $0 to $17,850, plus\n15% on taxable income over $17,850 to $72,500, plus\n25% on taxable income over $72,500 to $146,400, plus\n28% on taxable income over $146,400 to $223,050, plus\n33% on taxable income over $223,050 to $398,350, plus\n35% on taxable income over $398,350 to $450,000, plus\n39.6% on taxable income over $450,000.\nThen, pick your likely income range—which depends on the type of company\nformation you may have and the combination of your Owner’s Pay and Profit\ncontributions— and you have your federal tax rate. Now do the same thing for\nstate taxes and add the two.\n4. Or simply use 35% as your tax number. It may not be perfect, but\nit’s usually pretty effective. And while the optimal number will have\nyou neither paying additional taxes at the end of the year nor receiving\na refund, it is better to guess a little too high, get a refund and consider\nwhat to do with the extra cash than to get a call from your accountant,\nKeith, because you don’t have enough money, and have to ask your\ndaughter if you can borrow from her piggy bank. Trust me.\nBut hold on: If the tax rate is 35%, why would I only reserve 15% for taxes (as\nnoted in the Instant Assessment I shared earlier)? Let’s do a little simple math.\nA LITTLE SIMPLE MATH\nNow we are going to determine the percentage that stays in your Operating\nExpenses Account, after you move money to your Profit Account, your Owner’s\nPay Account and your Tax Account. The amount left over for expenses is likely\ngoing to be somewhere between 40% and 60%. This is the money you have\navailable to pay all your expenses.\nNext, subtract that percentage from 100%. So, if your total Operating Expenses\nAccount is at 55%, you’re left with 45%. That 45% is the amount you will be\ntaxed on. (More often than not, expenses are not taxed. This is why some\naccountants encourage you to buy equipment or make other large purchases\ntoward the end of the year.) Now, multiply your non-operating percentage (in\nthis case, 45%) with your taxable income percentage (in this case, 35%). You\nend up with a percentage of approximately 16%, which is your Tax percentage.\nNow that you have a more accurate picture of your actual percentages, you’re\nready to get started. In the next chapter we’ll take you through the first year of\nProfit First, and beyond, and outline everything you need to know from day one.\nCongratulations! You survived. Send me a selfie.\nI can sense your hunger to put this into practice in your business. Wipe that drool\noff your chin and let’s start doing it. Things are about to change around here.\nACTION STEP\nAPPLY YOUR ADVANCED KNOWLEDGE\nStep 1: Following the steps detailed above, determine your custom Profit,\nOwner’s Pay and Tax percentages based on your industry and other factors.\nStep 2: Since you chose to get down to the nitty-gritty and determine your exact\nProfit, Owner’s Pay and Tax percentages, stop now and adjust the numbers in\nyour Instant Assessment form.\nCHAPTER FIVE: Day One, Quarter One, Year One\nand Forever\nProfit First works. Period. Whether you use the percentages I provided for you in\nthe Instant Assessment or choose the path of assessing all the nuances of your\nbusiness and industry (see Chapter 4) and arrive at your own perfect allocation\npercentages, it will work. How can it work with different percentages, you ask?\nBecause your Target Allocation Percentages (TAPs) for your Profit, Owner’s\nPay and Tax Accounts are simply targets—you aren’t going to start with them,\nyou are going to build toward them. And as you build, you will transform your\nbusiness into a lean, mean efficiency machine that generates profit on every\ndeposit, no matter how small.\nRemember, the Profit First formula flip is easy:\nSales – Profit = Expenses\nIf you’re still stuck on finding your percentage, let me tell you a little story about\nthe power of just doing it. This is a story I heard secondhand, maybe even\nseventeenthhand; I’m not sure. And while I don’t know exactly whom the story\nis about, don’t doubt the story. It goes like this:\nAn up-and-coming motivational speaker went to a speaking boot camp. During\none of the sessions, the instructor explained how to make back-of-the-room\nsales. He said, “When you follow this method, eighty percent of the audience\nwill buy your product at the end of an event.”\nWith pages of notes and tons of enthusiasm, our up-and- comer set forth on the\nspeaking circuit. Initially, she closed only 25% of her audiences. Reaching for\nthat 80%, she tweaked and improved her strategy and pitch, constantly\nreviewing her notes. Over time her close rate rose to 50%, then 60%. After\nanother year, she was consistently selling 75% of the room after her speech. She\nhad achieved outstanding results, but not to the level her instructor had\npromised.\nOne morning, she sat down to breakfast with a few colleagues and her old\ninstructor happened to be there. She couldn’t wait to speak with him and get\ndirection about what could help her get that last, elusive 5%. What was the secret\nto finally breaking 80%? When she told her story to her instructor, his jaw\ndropped.\n“Eighty percent? You thought I said eighty percent? I said eighteen.” I tell you\nthis story to illustrate something I believe to be true because I’ve experienced it\n—no matter what the number is, if you work toward it and believe it’s a\npossibility, you will not only achieve it, you will blow past the “reasonable”\nnumbers others have set.\nIf you made the detailed assessment in Chapter 4, you probably looked at quite a\nfew public companies that are in the same space you are. You have seen their\nnumbers. You have seen their “reasonable” 18%. That’s my fear.\nEven if you are following my guidelines and pushing for healthy profits of 15%\nor 20%, the number may be too low. Many companies have absolutely done\nbetter. Million-dollar companies have posted 40% or more in profits. Yes, they\nare the exception, but someone has to be. Why not you? Why not choose to hear\n80% when the rest of the world chooses to hear 18%?\nIn this chapter, I will teach you exactly how to implement Profit First, step by\nstep, day by day, month by month, and so on. Your Profit Percentage may seem\nsteep or out of reach, but by the end of this year you will be closer to it than you\nthought you could be. You may even leave it in the dust.\nBEFORE WE BEGIN, MEET THE PRIDE OF PROFIT FIRST\nWhen Jorge Morales and Jose Pain started Specialized ECU Repair in 2007, they\ndreamed of one day enjoying what they perceived to be the big perk of owning a\nbusiness: profit, or, extra money to spend on their own interests. (Jorge is really\ninto free diving and Jose has a serious thing for model airplanes.)\nHere’s where many seasoned entrepreneurs chuckle knowingly under their\nbreath because they think this Jorge and Jose are dreamers. Don’t they know that\nentrepreneurship is about personal sacrifice? Unless they’re exceptionally lucky,\nit will be a long time before they earn enough extra cash to indulge in their little\nhobbies… right?\nWrong.\nTwo years into operating their own business, Jorge and Jose had decided the\nonly way they could reap the benefits of entrepreneurship would be to increase\ntheir salaries a little bit each year. (They were better off than most entrepreneurs\nin that they did have enough to pay their own salaries and hadn’t fallen into the\ndeath trap of debt.)\nThen they read the small section on Profit First Accounting in my book, The\nToilet Paper Entrepreneur, and began applying the system almost immediately.\nOver the next few years, Jorge and Jose tweaked Profit First to suit their rapidly\ngrowing business, adjusting their Profit Account percentages and allowing Profit\nFirst to control that growth so that they never ended up underwater because of\nlarge purchases or a ridiculously high payroll.\nFour years later Jorge and Jose have a thriving business that, in 2013, surpassed\ntheir accountant’s revenue projections. Their staff has tripled, but thanks to their\nshrewd, careful planning and the Profit First system, they are not struggling\nunder the weight of too-high operating expenses.\nMore importantly, their business is serving them, with salaries appropriate for\ntheir positions and the work they do at Specialized ECU Repair, and with\nsignificant Profit Account disbursements that have enabled them to live the\nlifestyle they envisioned when they started the business.\nThe dream all entrepreneurs have—that our business will improve the quality of\nour lives, not destroy it—Jorge and Jose are living that dream. They do not serve\ntheir business; their business serves them.\nDAY ONE\nTELL YOUR PEOPLE\nBefore you begin, I want you to tell your accountant what you’re up to. A\nwarning—he might not “get it.” He may say the system is useless, or it won’t\nwork, or it’s technically wrong or it’s too much hassle. If your accountant\ndiscourages you from using Profit First in your business, it is because he does\nnot fully understand cash flow management or human behavior. Get a new\naccountant.\nJorge and Jose included their financial professionals in the implementation of\nProfit First right from the start.\n“When we first learned about Profit First, it made sense to us,” Jorge told me, in\none of our many phone calls about their progress. “I pulled the numbers and\nthen, with our bookkeeper and accountant, we did a projection for the year. Then\nwe worked in the Profit Account percentage we wanted to start with.”\nWith buy-in from their accountant on the principles and processes of Profit First,\nJorge and Jose have been able to systematically apply the method to their\nbusiness with great success. Their accountant helps them meet their Profit First\ngoals and stay the course.\nTo make your life easier, I have compiled a list of accountants, bookkeepers,\nfinancial planners and others certified as Profit First Professionals. They not only\nget Profit First, they use it for themselves and they use it with their existing\nclients. You can find the list on the Resources section at MikeMichalowicz.com.\nThere you will also find a Profit First One-Sheet that gives a basic overview of\nthe system so that all of your key financial staff/ vendors can get up to speed\nwithin a few minutes.\nSET UP YOUR ACCOUNTS\nIf you didn’t set up your accounts after reading Chapter 2 (shame on you), do so\nnow. Most bank accounts allow you to assign a nickname to the account that is\ndisplayed, rather than just the account number. Give each account a name that is\neasy to identify and then put the percentage (or dollar amount—I’ll explain that\nin Chapter 9) in the name in brackets. This makes running Profit First so much\neasier. For example:\nOPERATING EXPENSES [45%] *8812\nOWNER PAY [25%] *8833\nPROFIT [15%] *8843\nTAXES [15%] *8839\nSTART OUT EASY\nWe are making progress now, baby! We have the accounts set up at your bank!\nYippee. We have determined your TAPs. Now we’re going to start with a\nmanageable Profit Percentage that will allow us time to cut down on expenses\nand adjust to the new system.\nWe’ll start at our historical contribution levels for each account and then add\n1%. This may mean you start from zilch. If your business has never had a profit,\nor if you have sometimes had a profit and sometimes a loss, your profit has been\nzero. Therefore, our easy start for the Profit Account will be 1% (that’s 0%\nhistorically plus 1%, starting today), and we will bump it up as we start getting\ninto our quarterly rhythm.\nIf your taxes were usually 5% of your total revenue, we are going to set up your\ntax reserve at 6%. If your pay represented 20% of your income, we add 1% to\nyour 20% and you have 21%. And so on. Even if our targets are much higher,\nwe start with what we’ve got, plus 1%.\nWhy start with small percentages, when we likely could do more? The reason is,\nthe primary goal here is to establish a new, automatic routine for you. I want the\namounts to be so small you don’t even “feel” them. The goal is to set up these\nautomatic allocations immediately, and then adjust the percentages each quarter\nuntil we are aligned with our TAPs.\nPractical to the core, Jorge and Jose started out with a modest Profit First\npercentage of 2%. (Because their decision was made more than four years ago,\nbefore I finessed this system, their number was not based on the “1% rule” I’ve\njust shared with you.) They chose an allocation of 2% because initially, Jorge\nwas reluctant to begin implementing Profit First—even though he knew it made\nperfect sense.\n“I think by going slowly, I was able to see how Profit First could work,” Jorge\nexplained. “What it really came down to was, I realized that at two percent, there\nwas no excuse not try it. Because if your business can’t afford to set aside two\npercent of your revenue, it’s probably not a business worth pursuing.”\nStart slow. These percentages you set are your quarterly allocation percentages.\nWe are going to use them for the rest of this quarter, whether the quarter begins\nnext week or in ninety-one days.\nPROFIT STARTING TODAY\nYou know the saying, “Today is the first day of the rest of your life.” I love it. I\nabsolutely love it. To me, it represents the profound realization that we can\nchange our lives (and our businesses) in a moment. Now is the time. This very\nmoment we will make a profit for your business, and we will be profitable every\nday going forward. Please don’t just read this and move on to the next chapter. I\nwant you to take action now.\nRight now, this moment, look at your bank balance in your Operating Expenses\nAccount. Then subtract any outstanding checks and payments you have from\nthat account. Divide up the remainder into your accounts based upon your TAPs.\nFor example, say you have $5,000 in your bank account, and you have $3,000 in\nchecks and payments still waiting to clear. That means you have $2,000\ncurrently available. Run your percentages on that $2,000 and move that money\ninto the accounts.\nDo you have any deposits to make today? If so, tally up the deposits, put them in\nthe bank, and then immediately distribute the money to all the other accounts. Do\nthis for every deposit going forward.\n(Don’t worry: you don’t need to do this every single day, or many times a day, if\nyou have lots of deposits. We are going to get you into a twice-a-month rhythm\nshortly that will make this process very manageable.)\nOUR FIRST CELEBRATION\nCongrats! And I am not saying that lightly. You’ve just taken a big step. This is\nlikely the first time in your entire business life that you have deliberately\naccounted for your profit first. Before anything else, you made sure you\naddressed your profit, your personal income and your tax responsibilities. That’s\na big deal. And it is a big step to a very, very healthy business. Kudos to you.\nSLICE EXPENSES\nNow that we are moving money into our Profit, Owner’s Pay and Tax Accounts,\nwe need to get the money from somewhere. There are only two ways to do that:\nby increasing sales and by cutting expenses. Increasing sales is very doable (you\ndid read The Pumpkin Plan, right?) and is the key for colossal profitable growth.\nBut it takes time and it won’t happen overnight. Cutting expenses is generally a\nvery quick process and is usually very easy.\nJorge and Jose run their business based on what they can afford today, not what\nthey hope to be able to afford someday. So sometimes they have to wait to hire\nsomeone or make a high-ticket purchase.\n“When big expenses showed up,” Jorge explained, “we would sit down and ask\nourselves, ‘Do we really need this?’ If we determined it would hurt our profits at\nthe end of the year, we didn’t buy it.”\nWe just accounted for at least 3% (1% in each of the Profit, Owner and Tax\nAccounts) of our income, so we need to cover that by cutting 3% from our\nexpenses. To do that, I need you to print out two things:\n1. All your expenses for the last twelve months.\n2. Any recurring expenses: rent, subscriptions, Internet access,\ntraining, classes, magazines, etc.\nNow add up all the expenses and then multiply that number by 10%. You must\ncut costs by 10%. Now! No ifs, ands or buts! So why cut by at least 10%, when\nwe “only need 3%”? Because cutting costs doesn’t mean the bills go away\novernight. It may take a month or two to pay down balances owed on expenses\nwe eliminate. More importantly, we need to start building cash reserves, because\nby the start of the next quarter, we are going to move another 3% to your Profit,\nTax and Owner’s Pay Accounts, and then another 3% the quarter after that. So\nwe want to account for that money quickly.\nYou can easily find your first 10% in cuts by doing the following:\n1. Cancel whatever you don’t need to help your business run\nefficiently and keep your customers happy.\n2. Negotiate every remaining expense, except payroll.\nI share a lot more about cutting expenses in the coming chapters. You are about\nto become a frugal (not cheap) entrepreneur. You will learn to use only what you\nneed and not be wasteful. You will pay fairly for what you use, but you will use\nless. And you are going to love it.\nMONTH AFTER MONTH\nTHE 10/25 RHYTHM\nYou remember my friend Debra Courtright, the bookkeeper who helped bail her\nclient out of sales tax hell? When I first taught her how to use Profit First with\nher clients, I drove to her office in Fairfield, New Jersey to spend the day going\nover all of the advanced strategies. Just an hour into our training day, she had not\nonly mastered the concepts, she was on the phone with one of her clients,\nhelping her set up a Profit Account.\nI always have my mobile office with me (backpack with laptop, other electronic\ngadgetry and critical lifesaving essentials—like Milano cookies). So while Debra\nwent over the basics with her client, I knocked out a few tasks on my to-do list. I\nknew I had some bills due, so I went into my online bank account, looked at the\nOperating Expenses Account and ensured that all of the disbursements were\ncurrent. Yep—Profit Account was up to do date. Tax Account looked good.\nOwner’s Pay Account—check. Other advanced accounts we’ll discuss later in\nthe book—all good. Now it was time to pay my bills from the Operating\nExpenses Account.\n“What are you doing?” Debra asked, startling me.\nI had no idea she was behind me, and I practically spit out my coffee. If you met\nDebra, you would never guess that she is a fully trained super-ninja or\nsomething. But she must be, because she has an ability to just appear next to you\nwithout you noticing. My tip? Avoid drinking any form of liquid when she’s\naround; you will either gag on it or spit it all over the table when you look up\nand see super-ninja Debra clinging to the ceiling above you.\n“I’m paying my bills,” I replied. “Why are you paying them today?”\nConfused, I replied, “Um. . . because I have time, and they’re due.” Debra said,\n“Well, that’s not smart.” (Ninjas don’t mince words.) “What do you mean?” I\nasked.\nThat’s when Debra taught me the 10th and 25th cash flow rhythm— paying\nexpenses twice a month, on the 10th and 25th. And that was the day the 10/25\nRhythm became integral to Profit First. Thanks, Debra! (If that is your real\nname.)\nI implemented the process in my business immediately. I let the bills come in,\nand I deposited income, but that was it. I no longer did accounting when I had\ntime, or when someone called to check and see if I’d received an invoice. I got\ninto a rhythm. I did my accounting every 10th and 25th (or the business day\nprior, if the 10th or 25th fell on a weekend or holiday). I chose those days so my\npayments arrive by the 15th and the end of the month, when most bills are due.\nFor our benefit we want to get into a rhythm of twice a month, and for our\nvendors benefit we want to make sure we pay them on time.\nFirst, I tallied all the new deposits that had gone in over the last few weeks and\ndid the Profit First allocations, moving money into each account. Then I tallied\nup all the bills and put them in the system.\nA little bit of magic started to happen. I became less and less reactive about bills.\nI didn’t immediately look at the bank account when I got a big bill and wonder\nwhy I spent so much, and when I could pay this one off. Instead I started to feel\nmore in control. By looking at my bills and my deposits two times a month, on\nthe same days each time, I could see a pattern. I noticed that 80% of my bills\nwere due at the beginning of the month, and that few were due in the second\nhalf. And I saw how my deposits were pretty equally dispersed over the month.\nI realized that I had many “small” recurring bills that added up to a lot of money\nand were unnecessary expenses. I started to see trends and understand my cash\nflow. I didn’t start to stack bills, paying what I could and then putting the ones I\ndidn’t pay back in a stack. I started to manage bills and cancel unnecessary stuff.\nI started to pay bills on time. Every bill.\nLiz Dobrinska, my graphics guru who designed my website and even the cover\nof this book, told me, “I don’t know what happened, Mike, but you now pay on\ntime every time. I wish all my customers were like you.”\nBefore I started following Debra’s advice, I paid Liz inconsistently. Sometimes I\npaid the bill the day it arrived. At other times, I sat on it for sixty or ninety days.\nIt wasn’t because I was trying to take advantage of her; I was simply in\nreactionary mode. My method of bookkeeping was not an effective way to\nunderstand my cash flow or to keep my critically important vendors happy. The\n10/25 Rhythm changed all that.\nHere’s how to get started:\n1. Deposit all revenue into your Operating Expenses Account.\n2. Every 10th and 25th day of the month, transfer the total deposits\nfrom the prior two weeks to each of your “small plate” accounts based\non your current allocation percentages. For example, let’s say you\nhave $10,000 in total deposits for the past two weeks. Based on the\nfollowing example percentages, here’s how you would allocate the\n$10,000:\nOperating Expenses 43% - $4,300 Tax 15% - $1,500\nOwner’s Pay 30% - $3,000\nProfit 12% - $1,200\nEmployee Pay ($750) - $0\nPetty Cash ($50) - $0\n3. Transfer the specific dollar amounts from the Operating Expenses\nAccount to respective accounts. In this example, Employee Pay for\n$750 and Petty Cash for $50. The accounts will now look like:\nOperating Expenses 43% - $3,500\nTax 15% - $1,500\nOwner’s Pay 30% - $3,000\nProfit 12% - $1,200\nEmployee Pay ($750) - $750\nPetty Cash ($50) - $50\n4. Transfer the full account balances for both your Tax and Profit\nAccounts to the respective “no temptation” accounts at your second\nbank.\n5. You have $3,000 in the Owner’s Pay Account from which to pay\nyourself. Take only what you have allocated as your biweekly salary,\nand leave the rest to accumulate. For this example, we’ll say your\nbiweekly salary is $2,750. This would leave $250 in the account.\n6. Pay your employees from the Employee Pay Account. For example,\nif you pay $675 this pay period, it would leave $75 in the account.\n7. With the remaining $3,500 in the Operating Expenses Account, pay\nyour bills.\nOnce you’ve done all that, the accounts would look like this:\nOperating Expenses 43% - $50\nTax 15% - $0\nOwner’s Pay 30% - $250\nProfit 12% - $0\nEmployee Pay ($750) - $75\nPetty Cash ($50) - $50\nProfit and Tax money will be accumulating at your “no temptation” second\nbank. As new deposits come in, you will deposit them in the Operating Expenses\nAccount, and on every future 10th and 25th you will repeat these same seven\nsteps.\nA big note here: There is a strong possibility that you will not have enough\nmoney in your accounts to do all this. If so, you’ve got a major wake-up call.\nWhen you don’t have enough money left over to pay your bills, it is your\nbusiness screaming at the top of its lungs, warning you that you can’t afford the\nbills you are incurring. You are spending more money than your business can\nsupport. But don’t panic. Later in the book I detail a process that will help you\nadjust to the 10/25 Rhythm as comfortably as possible. Even if you can’t pay\neverything on the 10th and 25th, you must get into this rhythm, because it will\nallow you to get a sense for the flow and accumulation of money. A heart fills\nwith blood and pumps it out, forming a heartbeat. The lifeblood of your business\nis money; it should flow in a rhythm like a heart, not in a random, panicked\npump here and there when you have money.\nQUARTER ONE\nQUARTERLY DISTRIBUTION\nThe new quarter has arrived. Yippee! You are about to take your very first ever\nquarterly distribution check. That’s right, baby. Your business is serving you,\nnow. You are going to take a distribution check every quarter. Every ninety\ndays, profit will be shared to you. This is where your Frankenstein monster starts\nto become a powerful, lovable beast and serves you a fine meal on a silver\nplatter with a perfectly matched California Pinot Noir. Don’t you just want to\npinch those chubby cheeks?\nThe quarters of every year are as follows:\nQuarter 1 – Jan 1 to March 31\nQuarter 2 – April 1 to June 30\nQuarter 3 – July 1 to September 31\nQuarter 4 – Oct 1 to December 31\n(This assumes your fiscal year is the same as the calendar year. If you have a\nfunky fiscal year, like if your year-end is May 31st, then your quarters will be\ndifferent.)\nOn the first day of each new quarter (or the first business day after), you will\ntake a profit distribution. Remember, the Profit Account serves a few purposes:\n1. Cash reserves.\n2. Metric to measure growth.\n3. Profit.\nTally the total amount of profit in the account (don’t add any quarterly\ndistributions percentages from deposits you received this day, yet) and take 50%\nof the money as profit. The other half remains in the account, as a reserve.\nNo matter what day you start doing Profit First, take a distribution for the current\nquarter on the first day of the new quarter. For example, let’s say you decide to\nimplement Profit First on August 12th. You allocate to your multiple accounts\nfrom that day forward. Then, on October 1st, or the first day of the new quarter\nthat you do your bookkeeping, you distribute the profit in the Profit Account.\nWhether you start this process on July 3rd or September 31st, the next quarter\nstill begins as of October 1st; so you distribute profits for the prior quarter that\nday. It doesn’t matter when you start doing Profit First; what matters is that you\nget into a quarterly rhythm.\nWelcome to the big leagues. You will now take a distribution every quarter, just\nlike large public companies do. They announce their quarterly income and then\ndistribute a portion of the profits to shareholders. And that’s exactly what you\nare going to do (see, you are all grown up now). Quarterly is a great rhythm, by\nthe way. It is a long enough time between distributions that you start looking\nforward to them, anticipating them. But it isn’t so frequent that they come to feel\nlike a normal part of your personal income.\nEvery quarter, you will take 50% of what is in the account, and leave 50% alone.\nFor example, let’s say you have saved $5000 in your Profit Account during the\nfirst quarter of implementing Profit First. On the first day of the new quarter, you\nwill take $2500 as a distribution to the equity owners and leave the other 50%\nintact.\nIf your company has multiple owners, the distributed profit is divided up based\non the percentage owned by each equity owner. Following the above scenario, if\nyou own 60% of the company, another partner owns 35% and an angel investor\nowns 5%, the distribution would be $1500 (for you, the 60% owner), $875 (for\nthe 35% guy) and $125 (for the investor).\nThe key is this: The profit distribution may never go back to the company. You\ncan’t use a fancy term like “plowback” or “profit retention.” No term you use\nwill cover up the fact that you are stealing from Paul to pay Peter.\nYour business must run on the money it generates for its operating expenses.\nThe plowback of profits means you aren’t operating efficiently enough to run on\nthe operating expenses. And if you give the profit back, you won’t experience\nthe very important reward of your company serving you. You’ll just be letting\nthe monster loose again. So always take your profit, every quarter, and use it for\nyour own purposes. It’s celebration time!\nCELEBRATION TIME!\nWhen you take your profit distribution, the money is only to be used for one\npurpose: for your personal benefit. Maybe you go out for a nice dinner with your\nfamily. Maybe you get that awesome new couch you have your eye on. Maybe\nyou go on a dream vacation.\nIn the four years since Jorge and Jose started implementing Profit First in their\nbusiness, they have taken several dream vacations— Bermuda, Europe, cruises\n—and have given those vacations to their loved ones as well. These guys know\nhow to celebrate!\n“Before we started using Profit First in our business, we were a little bit lost and\nwondered when the business would take off and improve our lifestyle,” Jorge\ntold me. “I don’t think anyone wants to work just for the paycheck. You need\nmore incentive. Now, at the end of the quarter, we really look forward to\nplanning what we’re going to do with the extra money.”\nWhatever it is, you must use your profits on you! Why? Because this is how you\nturn Frankenstein, that cash-eating monster, into a cash cow that keeps giving to\nyou and supporting you. Every quarter, with every profit you celebrate, you will\nfall more and more in love with your business.\nPAY UNCLE SAM\nEvery quarter, you will also pay your quarterly estimated tax. Your accountant\nprobably gave you estimates of how much you owe in taxes; now you pay them.\nYou will reduce some of the pain you feel when paying estimates, because on\nthis very same day each quarter, you also will take that profit for yourself, above\nand beyond your salary.\nONE SMALL STEP\nEach quarter, you need to evaluate your current percentages and move them\ncloser to your TAPs. You can move any percentage you choose to get to your\nTAPs, but know this—the goal is to never take a step back. I would much rather\nyou take a small step closer to your target Profit Percentage than take a big leap\ntoward it, only to step it back a month later.\nIf you are adjusting and tweaking your percentages conservatively, I suggest that\nyou account for three percentage points each quarter. That is, you could move\nyour Profit Account from 5% to 8%. Or you could move your Tax Account from\n11% to 12%, your Profit Account from 5% to 6% and your Owner’s Pay\nAccount from 23% to 24%.\nIf you can adjust further, go for it, by all means. Just remember, you can’t “undo\nyour percentages,” because that will undermine this new habit you have\nestablished. And don’t forget: at the start of next quarter, you will be doing this\nall over again. Think about what you’re doing for a second. You are now\ndistributing profits quarterly, which forces you to find ways to operate more\nefficiently. Isn’t that friggin’ cool? Your little company is now doing the same\nthing as the big kahunas in the industry. While Bloomberg Radio babbles on\nabout “higher than expected” quarterly profits and shareholder distribution by\nsuch-and-such public company, you can smile and feel pity for the public stock\nshareholders and the measly portions they get because you own a lot of stock in\nyour company. Oh man, does that feel good.\nYEAR ONE\nFINALIZE YOUR TAXES\nSince you’re in the quarterly rhythm of evaluating and moving closer to your\nTAPs, celebrating your profit disbursement and reassessing your expenses, there\nisn’t much of anything special you need to do on a yearly basis. The only thing\nyou need to add to your financial management at year-end is the finalization of\nyour taxes.\nDetermine how much you owe and how far off you were in your estimates. If\nyou owe more than you have in your tax account, a few things likely went\nwrong. You probably didn’t save a big enough percentage in your tax account,\nand/or you didn’t check in quarterly with your accountant to see how you were\ndoing throughout the year with your tax reserve.\nIf you owe taxes at year-end and don’t have the money in your tax account, this\nis the one time you can pull from your Profit Account for a reason other than\nprofit distribution. In fact, you have to. You won’t go to jail if you don’t have\nprofits to distribute to the owners, but you will go to jail if you don’t pay your\ntaxes. In this instance, pull the money you have from your Tax Account and your\nProfit Account to pay the taxes. Then adjust percentages in your Tax Account to\nensure you will have enough for the next year.\nWhen you adjust your tax percentage, reduce your profit percentage by that\namount. Yes, you are taking a hit on profits, but next quarter you will work on\ngetting those profits up again. The key now is to make sure you are fully\nprepared for taxes.\nIf you have too much money left in your Tax Account, congratulations—you can\nmove that money to your Profit Account and take a profit distribution. You may\nalso be able to reduce your Tax TAP and increase your profit allocation\npercentage by that amount. Just check with your financial expert first.\nRAINY DAY FUND\nAs your profits accumulate in your Profit Account, and you only take half as a\nprofit distribution, the remainder will act as a rainy day fund. You sort of\nbecome your own bank. This is a good thing, but too much cash on hand can be\na liability (people like to sue deep pockets); and money should be invested, not\nallowed to sit and stagnate month after month and year after year. This is a\nsimple analysis of what to do with your rainy day fund. First accumulate a threemonth cash reserve for your business, so you have enough cash saved to operate\nunscathed for three months if all sales came to a screeching halt and not another\npenny came into the business. Then, when you see that the money in your Profit\nAccount is in excess of a three-month reserve, you know this is a good\nopportunity to put money back into the business, to make some appropriate\ncapital investments that will bring a lot more growth and a lot more profit, or to\nfund The Vault Account (that’s a little teaser for what you will be learning in a\nlittle bit).\nFOREVER\nThe Instant Assessment gave you the TAPs, but you can do better. Like an\nathlete assessing her performance over time, as you use the Profit First system,\nyou will get a good sense of when and where you can push aspects of your\nbusiness to the next, world-class level. If you can, push for 22% profit, or higher,\nor cut expenses down to 15%.\nEven with you, and all the financial folks who help you in your business,\nfollowing Profit First, you’re still not finished. You can get every single person\nin your business, regardless of what they do, supporting the business with Profit\nFirst. They will do it by implementing a new type of to-do list.\nIn my second book, The Pumpkin Plan, I explain colossal seed-to-business\ngrowth—the intersection of uniqueness, top customer demand and systems.\nYour uniqueness (unique offering) is what makes money, but that only happens\nwhen your top customers want your offering. If you can deliver it to them on\nautomatic, you have the potential to become a colossal force in your industry.\nThese three factors form a new, better way to create and maintain a to-do list.\nYou will use three symbols: a $ (dollar sign), a ☺ (smiley face) and an ∞\n(infinity symbol).\nFrom today forward, your team can quickly determine their most profitable\ntasks. If something will likely make money for the company within the next\nsixty days, give it a $. If it is something for a top client, give it a smiley face ☺;\nand if it is a system that can be created so that other people or things can do the\ntask perfectly and you no longer need to do it, give it a ∞.\nNext, write down the tasks you have. Code each of them with no symbol (if it\ndoesn’t apply to the three categories above), or one of the symbols above. In\nsome cases, a task will get two symbols or all three. Then prioritize your to-do\nlist based upon the symbols in this order:\nFirst do $ ☺ ∞ These are God’s gifts to tasks. When you do one of these, you\nwill make money, make a client happy (which, by the way, is the most powerful\nform of marketing) and systematize the task as a repeatable process. That way,\nthe next time this task presents itself, you just hand it off and it will be done\nperfectly! Profit with a client loving it, and you will be able to do this on\nautomatic going forward.\nNext is $ ☺ Happy client paying you money = a happy life. Then $ ∞ This is a\ntask that lets you make money and develop a system to make it happen\nautomatically. Maybe not for the current client, but automatic money usually\nmeans new clients down the road.\nThen do ☺ ∞ This is a task that makes a client happy. You will develop a\nsystem so that it happens on automatic. Consider it automatic client retention\nand automatic marketing.\nThen do $ This task means you are bringing in money. Profit, baby!\nNext, do ☺ You might not make money immediately by performing this task,\nbut a happy client is key to sustainability, is powerful marketing and usually\nleads to more money in the future.\nThen do ∞ With this task, you build a system so that you don’t have to do it\nanew every time.\nAnd lastly, do “ ” That is a blank. I just put the air quotes there so you could see\nit was blank. In many cases, as you think of tasks and write them down, you will\nnotice that most are blanks—they don’t or won’t make money in the near future,\nthey don’t serve clients and they aren’t building systems. Do these things last.\nBy having everyone at your company prioritize their to-do lists with this simple\nsystem, you push Profit First. Don’t just give this to-do system to a few people.\nShare it with your entire staff. Help them focus on the three things that matter\nmost: profit (the lifeblood of your business, without which you can’t sustain the\nbusiness), clients (the real boss; without them there is no business); and systems\n(the only way you can grow and compete).\n• • •\nJorge and Jose are living the American dream. Just ask them— they’ll tell you\nthey are most definitely living the life they set out to experience when they first\nopened the doors of Specialized ECU Repair. If you follow the steps outlined in\nthis book, you too will look back on your first Profit First year with awe and\nappreciation. You’ll be living the dream, baby!\nACTION STEPS\nGET READY FOR A GREAT YEAR\nStep 1: Go back to the beginning of the chapter and complete all of the “Day\nOne” tasks outlined there: notify your accountant, set up your accounts (if you\nhaven’t done so already), and make your first Profit Account deposit or transfer.\nStep 2: Start a “celebration list”: come up with ideas for how you to spend your\nquarterly owner’s distribution. Include small treats and big indulgences. Post the\nlist where you can see it, for inspiration and motivation and as a reminder when\nthe quarter comes around and you convince yourself there are more practical\nuses for the money.\nStep 3: Based on the system I shared in this chapter, revamp your to-do list and\nstart using it immediately. You can download blank Profit First To-Do forms at\n—you guessed it—the Resources tab at MikeMichalowicz.com.\nCHAPTER SIX: Destroying Debt\nWell-dressed poverty is still poverty. Just because your business is making lots\nof money doesn’t mean you’re hanging onto it. Too many entrepreneurs believe\nthat the top line is what defines success and then behave accordingly. Another\nbig client comes on board, and the entrepreneur expands the office. A big sale\nrolls in, and with it a fancy dinner. It’s like putting Frankenstein’s monster in a\ntuxedo and having it dance and sing to “Puttin’ On the Ritz” (shout-out to Mel\nBrooks). The monster may look as if it has its act together, but it doesn’t. One\ntiny bit of faulty wiring—like, the big client decides not to pay its bills—and the\nmonster goes on a rampage. Everything falls apart.\nTwo years ago, my cell phone rang with a call from my friend Pete. I was\nexpecting the call—we had plans to have dinner in New York City that weekend\nand, since Pete is a resident of The Big Apple, he knows all the hot spots. I\nfigured he was calling to confirm plans. The call was not what I expected.\n“I’m sorry Mike, I can’t do dinner this weekend,” Pete said, his voice strained.\n“Damn, that sucks. I was really looking forward to it. But no problem, brother.\nLet’s reschedule,” I said, looking at my calendar. “What’s going on? Heading\nout of town?”\n“Yeah, kinda. Well, not really,” Pete replied. Then he sighed and said, “I, uh…\nI’m broke, Mike. I’m broke.”\nPete explained that his bank had called his line. I’m not sure if you’re familiar\nwith this experience, but here’s how it works: You get a revolving line of credit\nfrom the bank. It’s a bank account that functions like a credit card, in that you\ncan draw as much money from it as you want, up to your credit limit, and pay it\nback over time. As long as you pay your interest and make your minimum\npercentage payment every month, you’re good.\nExcept there’s this pesky little rule in the fine print that says the bank can call\nback the entire loan at any time. Even if you’ve paid your monthly percentage on\ntime every month, even if you’re not carrying a high balance, the bank can yank\nyour line of credit without warning. And once the bank calls to notify you that\nthey’re calling your line, the clock starts ticking. You have thirty days to pay\nback every single penny. Tick. Tick. Tick.\nPete got the call. His line? A million bucks. The amount he had drawn from the\nline? A million bucks. The amount in his company’s cash reserves that he could\ntap into? Zero. Needless to say, dinner in Manhattan was off.\nStruggling to get the words out, Pete said, “Mike, can you help me? I’ll follow\nyour lead. I’ll do anything. If you told me to run naked in the streets, I’d do it.”\nOf course I agreed to help him find a way to dig himself out of this massive debt.\nA Lady Godiva-like naked romp through the streets of New York might get him\nsome attention and give me enough razzing fodder for years to come, but it\nsurely wouldn’t address his debt (in fact it would probably add to it, what with\nthe fine for lewd and lascivious behavior). So we spent two hours on the phone\nthat night, going over Profit First in detail. At first Pete was confused—why was\nI talking about profit when he was so far in the hole? You may be feeling this\nway, too. I get it. It’s awfully hard to think about profit, let alone plan for it,\nwhen your situation is as dire as Pete’s. You may not have a million dollars in\ndebt, but I’ll bet that whatever debt you’re carrying feels like it might as well be\na million dollars, at times.\nThis is the ultimate survival moment. If you focus all of your energy on paying\ndown debt, that is all you will ever achieve. You’ll still be caught in the trap of\ntop line thinking, which will likely result in more debt.\nAgain, there are similarities here to weight loss. If you’re overweight, at a\ncertain point your “credit line” will be called. Maybe you’ll see yourself in a\nfamily photo and realize you can no longer say it’s “just a bit of a muffin top,”\nbecause that muffin top is dropping down to your knees and tickling your toes.\nMaybe one day you’ll get tired of always being tired. Or maybe it will be\nsomething much worse—like a heart attack or diabetes—that finally moves you\nto say, “Enough is enough.”\nWe can trace almost every major change to a pivotal moment when the pain of\nstaying a certain way is greater than the effort to make awareness of it go away.\nCall it a tipping point or a turning point, a revelation or a wake-up call; whatever\nname you give it, the choice is the same. Will you fix the crisis or the root of the\nproblem?\nWhen life “calls the line,” we take action. The problem is, most of the time the\naction we take is a reaction, a narrow, driving focus on the alleviation of\nimmediate pain. We move heaven and earth to bail ourselves out of a jam with\nlittle thought of creating permanent change. Why do so many people who have\nlost weight gain it all back (and then some)? Because as soon as they reach their\ngoal, they revert to old habits. Sure, no one wants to drink a gallon of water and\neat grapefruit every morning for the rest of their lives, or spend so much time\nwith the Thighmaster that they’re going to have to think about going steady with\nit. The pain of being fat is gone—what’s the point of taking another Richard\nSimmon’s Cruise to Lose?\nOnce the pain is gone, the action we decided to take in that pivotal moment falls\naway. No more grapefruit. No more water. No more Thighmaster. Grapefruit is\nreplaced with grape jellybeans. Water turns to soda. And the Thighmaster is\ntossed into the basement where all good intentions go to die. Is it any wonder\nthat when the weight comes back, it’s with a vengeance? After all, your mind\nnow knows you can lose weight in a pinch. Who cares if you gain a few pounds?\nYou can always crash diet again, right? Try out for The Biggest Loser? And of\ncourse there’s always “the surgery.”\nWhat my friend Pete intended to do was the same deal, different crisis. He had\nhad the equivalent of a financial heart attack. As soon as his big moment hit, he\nbecame a man on a mission—crush that debt immediately! By whatever means\nnecessary, he would dig himself out of the crisis. His actions (or reactions) were\nthe equivalent of a crash diet. He wasn’t giving any thought to how to make his\nbusiness permanently healthy.\nIf Pete manages to survive this crisis in crash diet mode, what are the chances he\nwill find himself in a similar situation—or worse—a few months or years from\nnow? The chances are high—so high I would say it’s a sure bet.\nEven when you and your business are in debt up to your eyeballs, you must\nestablish a habit of putting your profit first. You must still (and always) pay\nyourself first. When you get into the habit of fiscal health based on this system,\nyou will fix the problem permanently. Financial crises will be a thing of the past,\nbecause if someone calls your line, you’ll have the cash to cover it.\nHere is what I told Pete: “If you have debt, be it one thousand, one million or\nsomewhere in between, you need to kill that debt once and for all while still\nslowly and methodically building profit.”\nThe Profit First system I’m teaching you will keep your focus on a super-healthy\nbusiness, working in your sweet spot to produce goods and provide services for\nideal clients. This laser focus will automatically keep your costs down, allowing\nyou to pay off debt faster and eventually increase your Profit Percentage. The\ntweak is, when you distribute profits, ninety-nine percent of the money goes to\npaying down debt. The remaining one percent goes toward rewarding yourself.\nThis way, the debt gets hit just as aggressively, but you still strengthen your\nProfit First habit.\nIn short, if you wait to implement Profit First until after you pay down your debt,\nyou are less likely to ever build the business efficiencies that will permanently\neradicate your debt and create a perpetual profit stream. Start the habit now, and\neventually that ninety-nine percent will go toward building up your cash reserves\nand your own owner distribution.\nANOTHER SIMPLE SOLUTION MOST PEOPLE DON’T BELIEVE\nACTUALLY WORKS\nBy now I hope you’re a member of the “How healthy is your business?” club.\nAre you wearing the t-shirt? I am. What? Don’t have one? Don’t know where to\nget your own? I’ll give you a hint—it’s in your closet. Sharpie, old t-shirt,\n“Profit First” on the front, “How healthy is your business?” on the back. Ten\nseconds. Done. What? Did you think I was going to give you a link to my online\nstore? Hardly. A profitable business happens when you save your pennies at\nevery turn, my friend. That’s how we club members roll. Frugal. Not cheap, but\nfrugal, for sure. And that is how I ended up with the homemade masterpiece I’m\ncurrently sporting—and a healthy cash reserve that is about to send my family\nand me on a nice vacation, where I will wear my awesome t-shirt with pride,\nthank you very much!\nGetting that healthy business all boils down to one really, really simple formula:\nYou must consistently spend less money than you make.\nDuh, right? I’m sure you knew that. Everyone knows that. So why do so few\npeople follow it? Spending less than you make every day, every week, every\nmonth, every year, every decade leads to wealth and freedom from financial\nstress. And yet most of us can’t seem to do this one simple thing.\nHere again we’re talking logic versus human behavior. If logic worked for us\nhumans, we’d all be rich. I wouldn’t be writing this book to tell you how to do\nthis, because you would already be doing it. Instead, I would have one of my\nminions swim from my big yacht over to your even bigger yacht to ask if you\ncould spare some Grey Poupon. Then we would both chuckle at the complete\nabsurdity of the situation. I mean, who would have the audacity to eat anything\nwith a common man’s mustard like Grey Poupon?\nThis is the challenge all of humanity faces: We know what we have to do, but\nwe still don’t do it. Why is that? Why do so many of us consistently fail to\nbecome rich and accumulate debt instead? Why? Why? (Picture me on my knees,\ndramatically banging my fist on the ground and shouting, “Why, why?” like\nScarlett O’Hara in Gone with the Wind.)\nFortunately for us, Suze Orman has the answer.\nNow, let me say something about Ms. Orman. I am a huge fan. However, I have\nnever watched her show on CNN and, aside from one book (which I still haven’t\nread in its entirety), I have not purchased any of her products. I’m a fan of hers\nbecause I saw a lecture she gave on PBS one Sunday morning.\nI like to write early on Sunday mornings, when all is quiet in the house. But on\nthis particular morning I decided to brew a pot of coffee and channel surf\ninstead. Thank God I did. As I flipped through the channels, I saw Suze Orman\ntalking to a group of about fifty people. I had heard of her and seen her picture a\nmillion times, and I was curious to see how she presented in a public speaking\nformat. Maybe I could glean some tips and tricks on being a better presenter.\nAnd let me tell you, she is really good. I have seen hundreds of speakers, and she\ntruly impressed the heck out of me.\nWhile explaining personal financial strategy to the audience she stopped, looked\naround the room and said, “The solution to debt is this simple: If you want to get\nout of debt, you must get more enjoyment out of saving your money than you do\nspending your money.”\nThis was a life-changing realization for me. I put down my coffee and stared out\nthe window. Suze continued to speak, but I was so caught up in my a-ha\nmoment, I heard nothing. I just kept repeating what she said about saving versus\nspending over and over in my head. “That’s it,” I thought. Wealth is a game of\nemotion. Business success is a game of emotion. Profit First is a game of\nemotion. It all comes down to the story we tell ourselves about what we’re\ndoing. “Is what I’m doing making me happy, or not?”\nWhen something makes you happy in the moment, you’ll keep doing it. If\nspending makes you happy, you’ll spend more. Period. And that spending can be\non anything from a new tie to a new hire to new mountains of debt. If saving\nmakes you happy, you’ll look for any opportunity to save more. Coupons, sales,\nbargain bins—heaven. Saving one hundred percent because you eliminated the\nexpense entirely? Nirvana.\nListening to Suze that day, the whole “pain and pleasure” motivation that\nAnthony Robbins has talked about for years finally made sense to me. The pain\nmoment is the kick in the ass, when you finally say enough is enough. Pain gives\nyou a big shove out the door. For me, the pain moment was my daughter sliding\nher piggy bank toward me, trying to save our family from absolute financial\nruin. For Pete, it was a call from the bank.\nBut pain just gets you to take enough action to get out of immediate pain. Then it\nstops working. Suze was teaching me the other half: pleasure. (Don’t do it. Don’t\nlet your mind go there. And… there it went. Keep reading when you get your\nmind out of the gutter, pervert. I’ll wait.)\nThe premise is simple—we avoid pain and move toward pleasure, putting a\nsignificant emphasis on the moment (remember the Recency Effect) and very\nlittle emphasis on the long term. Immediate pain gets the ball rolling, but\npleasure keeps it moving. You probably picked up this book because of pain,\nand you will likely see results quickly because your efforts will reduce the pain.\nBut the only way you will be able to make this work forever is if you get\nimmediate pleasure each time you exercise your new habits. Just as at the gym,\nyou can only work out so many times before the pain of seeing your muffin top\nin the mirror isn’t worth all the effort anymore… and it is at that exact moment\nthat you most need to derive true joy from working out, because it is what will\nhelp keep you fit and trim forever.\nIf you are stuck in the grow-more/spend-more mode and accumulating debt, it\nisn’t because you don’t understand the numbers. You are absolutely not an idiot.\nThe problem is assuredly linked to your emotions. You are getting instant—\nalbeit momentary—pain relief, because your mind believes that your investment\nwill bring results (the hope of future and permanent returns). When this doesn’t\nhappen, you slip back into panic, sell like a mad dog and spend (more often\nusing the friendly term “invest”) to grow. You find momentary pain relief in\nmaking some type of progress. But when it fails to yield more cash in your\npocket, the pain comes back. It’s a nasty cycle.\nFortunately, the fix is simple, if you allow it to be: Give yourself more joy when\nyou choose not to spend money than you do when you choose to spend it. Give\nyourself more joy when your bottom line grows (not just the top line). Give\nyourself tons of joy when your Profit Percentage grows.\nYou do this by acknowledging it to yourself. I don’t care if you feel like Stuart\nSmalley giving yourself a pep talk in the mirror; you must train your mind to\nfind joy in implementing the Profit First system. (One of the best ways to find\njoy in this is to hang out with other Profit First entrepreneurs. Everything is more\nfun when you share the experience with others. I’ll talk more about this in\nChapter 8, when I teach you how to participate in an accountability group—a\nProfit Accelerator Group or Profit Pod.)\nWhen you opt not to spend money, acknowledge it. Give yourself a pat on the\nback. Do a happy dance. Celebrate every time you save— whether it’s ten bucks\nor ten thousand. Put on your favorite music and crank it, get really happy.\nEmbarrass your kids at the mall. Heck, embarrass yourself. Don your new Profit\nFirst Sharpie t-shirt, sans trousers, and post that one on Facebook. Over time you\nwill train your mind to equate happiness and celebration with choosing saving\nmoney over spending it (and perhaps walking around malls in a t-shirt and\ntighty-whities).\nIt’s hard to get by without food or water, and toilet paper is a really handy thing\nto have. When you do have to spend money, reward yourself for getting the best\ndeal possible. Find a good price for the essential things you need and don’t buy\nthe nonessentials. Then start the t-shirt celebration all over again.\nTHE “JUST ONE MORE DAY” GAME\nRemember the story about how I lost my first fortune by becoming the Angel of\nDeath? You might remember that, in the end, all but one of the companies I\ninvested in went belly up. The lone survivor was Hedgehog Leatherworks. The\nowner, Paul Scheiter, is an amazing guy. I consider him my best friend. I shared\nsome of the success strategies we employ at Hedgehog in The Toilet Paper\nEntrepreneur and The Pumpkin Plan, so if you read those books then Paul\nprobably seems like your best friend, too.\nRecently I went to visit Paul at his place in St. Louis, Missouri. As we drove by\na Home Depot on the way to his leather shop, he said, “Oh, I need to get some\nelectrical stuff for the office.”\nThen he smiled and kept driving. “Why don’t we pick it up?” I asked.\n“I will,” he replied. “In just one more day.”\nThe next day we drove by the same Home Depot. Paul looked at the sign,\ngrinned from ear to ear, then looked away and drove on.\nI said, “Don’t we need the electrical supplies?” “Absolutely we do. Just one\nmore day.”\nThis pattern went on for the entire week. At the end of my visit, Paul drove me\nto the airport. Just before we pulled up to my drop-off point, I asked him why he\nhadn’t yet bought the electrical supplies he needed. That’s when he shared his\n“Just One More Day” technique. I had some time before my flight, so we pulled\nover to short-term parking. During the next half hour, he laid it all out for me.\nPaul understands the formula, spend less + make more = wealth. He also\nunderstands that for this formula to work, both factors in the equation must\nprovide him with an emotional win.\nIt’s easy to feel happy about making more money, but to achieve real wealth you\nalso have to train yourself to feel happy when you spend less. Paul achieves this\nby rewriting the formula in his mind. His version is (+spend less) + (+make\nmore) = wealth. In Paul’s formula both spending less and making more are\npositives. Not surprisingly, his formula is like the Profit First Formula; it\nprioritizes human behavior, not logic.\nWhen Paul needs to purchase something, he plays the “Just One More Day”\ngame. He challenges himself to go just one more day without the item. Every\ntime he passes up an opportunity to buy whatever he needs, he gets pumped. He\ngets a high from going without for one more day. Sometimes, while playing this\ngame, Paul discovers that he no longer needs the product or service he intended\nto buy. Playing the game opens up other possibilities, and truly tests how badly\nyou need something. Sometimes you can’t get around it—you have to spend\nmoney on something because you actually need it. But by waiting “just one more\nday,” you are not only keeping operating cash in your account for one more day;\nyou are giving yourself another day to come up with alternatives.\nTHE WORST MONTH\nIf you’re like most entrepreneurs, your personal income is wildly unpredictable.\nIt changes month by month, depending on sales and collections. We’re a hopeful\nbunch, entrepreneurs—we have to have the nerve to launch a business in the first\nplace. So it’s no surprise that most entrepreneurs are bamboozled by their hopes\nand look at their best revenue months as the new normal, when very often it is\nnot. Until your best month becomes your average month, it’s not the norm; it’s\nthe exception.\nWhen you base decisions on your best revenue month, you will run out of cash\n—quickly. Debt will start to pile up. And you will go back to your old standby,\n“sell more—grow, grow, grow!” Acting as if your best month is the norm is one\nsurefire way to keep yourself locked in the Survival Trap.\nIn fact, accountants joke about this. I had a call with Andrew Hill and Gary\nNunn, the founders of Solutions Tax & Bookkeeping in Frisco, Texas, about the\nspending habits of entrepreneurs, and they told me the inside joke. Whenever a\nclient approaches them about a windfall of new money, the client will inevitably\nsay, “I don’t even know how I would ever spend all this money.”\nEach time, Andrew and Gary have the same response: “Oh, you’ll find a way.\nAnd you’ll probably figure it out within the next month.” Maybe that insiders’\njoke isn’t ROTFLMAO (Rolling On The Floor, Laughing My Ass Off) funny to\nyou, but it is to Andrew and Gary. They hear the same comments from\nentrepreneurs all the time, and in every case, by the next month, the money is\ngone.\nEvery. Time.\nThat’s why percentages are such a valuable tool. As an entrepreneur, your\nincome varies. Some months are great; some months suck; and most are average.\nBut it is typical behavior for entrepreneurs to look at their best month and tell\nthemselves, “This is my new normal”— and then start spending and taking from\nthe business accordingly.\nPercentages are based on real results—the cash in the bank. No games, no\nhypotheticals, no, “We’ll make it up next month.” Projections are an opinion.\nCash is a fact.\nThe percentages put a varying sum of money into your different accounts, such\nas Owner’s Pay, every 10th and 25th; and then you draw your owner’s salary\nfrom that account based on the pay you allotted. If you have more money in the\naccount then you take in salary, the difference in money stays and accumulates.\nThis way, when (notice I didn’t say if) a slow month happens, money has\naccumulated in your Owner’s Pay Account and your salary stays consistent. If\nthe money in the Owner’s Pay Account is not enough to pay your salary, you\ncan’t take it. You need to make a hard decision about cutting other costs, and\nyou’d better kick ass growing the top line with great clients, too.\nSo how do you predict the owner’s salary your company will likely support?\nLook at your slowest three months and average them. That is the lowest your\nrevenue will likely ever go. Then determine the percentage of this income that\nwill be allocated to Owner’s Pay (35% for example, times the average monthly\nrevenue for the three worst months). Every quarter, we will do a salary raise\nbased on how much money is in the Owner’s Pay Account and whether it is\naccumulating faster than we are withdrawing it. Take the bump that you can\nreasonably take based upon your twelve-month, rolling average. As long as the\naccount accumulates more cash or stays even, you are taking a healthy salary\n(one that your company can healthily support).\nTHE DEBT FREEZE\nI’ve taught you how to ensure your business is profitable immediately— from\nyour very next deposit. Now I’m going to teach you how to immediately stop\naccumulating debt, and to destroy the debt you currently have. I call the method\nyou are about to learn the “Debt Freeze.” It will guide your business through a\nrapid pay-down of accumulated debt and a freeze of new debt, both while\ncontinuing your Profit First habit.\nNow, don’t panic. I’m not asking you to sell everything and move into a van\ndown by the river. I’m not even asking you to stop spending entirely. That can\nirreparably damage your business. I am simply asking you to commit to a\nspending freeze that will free you from debilitating debt. The goal here is to cut\ncost, not to compromise the business. You can fire all your people, shut down\nyour website, refuse to pay a penny to anyone and seriously move into a van\ndown by the river with your new roommate and struggling motivational speaker,\nMatt Foley. . . but you’ll be out of business. You want to cut out the fat of your\nbusiness, the stuff that is not generating or supporting income for your company.\nBut you don’t want to cut out the muscle, the stuff that you absolutely must have\nto deliver your product or service.\nYou need to know where you stand. The first step is to assess where you are\ntoday. Fear is only amplified by a lack of knowledge. If you don’t know your\nexact numbers, your mind goes wild and says crazy things (like. . . “Ahh. . . I am\ngoing broke. . . ahh. . . the only thing worse is Mike dressed up like Scarlett\nO’Hara. Ahh. . . what the hell am I thinking? Ahh!”). You can’t change what\nyou don’t acknowledge, so you need to know exactly what you’re dealing with.\nAnd when you know what you are dealing with, your mind doesn’t drift nearly\nas much.\nFor those of us who get happy when we save (remember Suze’s speech?), the\nDebt Freeze is a rave party. To be clear, this is my kind of party, and I’m a freak.\nWhen you see the crazy debt-reduction fun we have planned, you might want to\nback out the front door as quickly as possible. But, if you want to be debt free\nforever, stick around. Here are the steps to getting your party started:\nPRINT AND MARKUP DOCS\n1. Print out your current income statement for the last twelve months,\nas well as your current accounts payable report, your credit card\nstatements, loan statements and any other statements related to debt,\nand your last twelve months of payments made from any of your\nbusiness bank accounts. If you do not have an income statement ready,\njust gather the other documents.\n2. With a highlighter, draw a box around any labor costs— salaries,\ncommissions and bonuses for employees. Exclude owner salaries\nand payments to freelancers and subcontractors.\n3. Now highlight expenses that were required to generate immediate\nrevenue. For example, if you are a private investigator, you might\nhighlight the purchase of a USB drive you use to store evidence that\nyou give to your clients. If you bought a USB drive that you do not\ngive to clients and just use internally, that item would not be\nhighlighted.\n4. Next, highlight any expenses that are absolutely necessary to keep\nyour business open. This does not include employees or contractors, or\nany people you boxed with your highlighter already in Step 3. If you\nhave a spy car that is outfitted for surveillance and you need it to—\nwell, spy—highlight it. If you have a spy car that really isn’t a spy car,\nit’s just your ride, don’t highlight it.\n5. With a red pen, circle expenses that repeat every month, quarter or\nyear and will continue to do so. Note: Some expense items, like labor\ncosts, will get highlighted or boxed and circled.\nNOW LET’S DO SOME MATH\n6. Add up all the expenses for the year; include everything you\nhighlighted, circled, boxed or left blank. Exclude tax payments and\nowner’s distributions or salaries. Divide the result by twelve to\ndetermine your monthly “nut”—the total amount you have decided\nyou need to cover each month.\n7. Determine the difference between your current monthly operating\nexpenses and the number it must be according to your Instant\nAssessment. For example, if you currently have $52,000 in average\nmonthly expenses and your Instant Assessment has your monthly\nexpenses at $30,000, you need to cut your operating expenses by\n$22,000. Period. There will be no justifying past spending mistakes, no\nsaying, “But I need everything.” You don’t. Your healthy, booming\ncompetitor has figured it out. You need to put on your big-girl panties\nand accept that you spent too much, and today is the day we fix it.\n(Kinda creepy that I know you wear big-girl panties, isn’t it?)\n8. Band-Aids come off more easily when you tear them off. Chipping\naway a little debt here and a little debt there prolongs the agony; rarely\nfixes a company fast enough; never changes your behaviors to those\nthat truly put profit first; and is really, really scary for your employees.\nCutting back a few things (or people) at a time puts your employees\n(and you) in a constant state of uncertainty. Ripping off the Band-Aid\nwill make you scream in pain momentarily, but the healing starts right\naway. The same is true with debt.\nTo avoid having to keep chipping away at debt, it’s best to plan to cut\nexpenses until you are operating at 10% below the target number on\nyour Instant Assessment. So if we know we need to cut expenses down\nto $30,000 to be in the Profit First range for operating expenses, we\nwant to do what we can to cut down to $27,000 (that extra 10%).\nWhy? Because when you cut expenses, you may realize that\nsomething has a negative effect on your business, and you can’t\nreplace it with a timely alternative. You may need to take a few\nexpenses back on. I call this “expense bounce-back.” It happens—we\njust need to prepare for it.\nBUILD A LEANER TEAM\n9. Labor cost is usually the most expensive part of operating any\nbusiness. This is the first expense you put a highlighted box around on\nyour income statement, and you almost definitely circled it in red pen,\ntoo. If your company is racking up debt, it is all too often because\nlabor cost is too high. The problem with cutting labor cost is, our\nminds quickly defend and justify why people should stay: “I own the\ncompany;” “I can’t do the work;” “I need to direct my team to do the\nwork.” Plus, they need a job (which is true), they are integral to the\ncompany (probably also true), the company will tank without them\n(super unlikely), and if I get rid of them I won’t have people to do the\nwork (hardly ever true).\nOverstaffed entrepreneurs have either tried to get themselves out of\ndoing work as quickly as possible (they like to think they are managers\nnow, or better yet, they need to spend extraordinary amounts of time\non the corporate “vision”) or believe that systems aren’t core to a\nbusiness (which they are). You need to let go of people. And you have\ngot to realize that switching from working in the business to on the\nbusiness is not like flipping a light switch. It is gradual. Often, the\nmost under-used employee in an overstaffed company is you, the\nowner. It’s time you get back to actually doing the work, and in the\nfuture we will slowly transition you from in to on.\nNow, back to your overstaffed company. Evaluate each person and\ndetermine if her role is mandatory for operations to continue (not the\nperson, but the role). If a person wears multiple hats (for example is\nyour receptionist and in-house sales person), ask yourself if each role\nis mandatory for operations to continue.\n10. Next, evaluate your staff. Are there any people who aren’t “Aplayers”? Do you have any people who are actually bad for the\ncompany? Those people are costing you money in more ways than\none.\n11. Ignoring the salaries and how you feel about the people, determine\nthe following: a) which roles must stay in-house no matter what, b)\nwhich roles could be outsourced and c) which roles the company can\ncontinue without.\n12. Next, look at your people. Look at yourself. What roles could you\ntake on? Now look at your best employees, the A-players. Can they be\nshifted around to cover the roles that must stay in-house? Are there\nany must-have roles that can only be handled by a specific person?\n13. Plan the layoffs. Now, before I get into this, I want you to know\nthat I know how devastating it is. I know how much you will want to\nresist ever doing this, because I did. There was a day when I had to lay\noff ten people out of my twenty-five-employee company. It was the\nmost difficult day of my professional life. I had to lay off nearly half\nmy staff, not because they did anything wrong, but because I did—I\nmismanaged the numbers; I hired quickly and often and unnecessarily.\nI also want you to know that no matter how devastating it is, laying\npeople off is necessary. Trying to keep a few employees your company\ncannot afford will only put your company under, thereby ensuring that\neveryone loses their job. And, because you prioritize the layoff of\npoorly-performing staff and people who fill roles that are not a core\nneed for your company, you are not just saving the cost of keeping\nthese people on; you are also building a more efficient infrastructure.\nKeep in mind that in letting these people go, you are freeing them to\nfind a job that is a better fit. Yes, it sucks that you need to fire the\npeople you hired on good faith. But it would be worse if you kept them\nin a dead-end job. I know this firsthand. Just this morning I looked up\nthe LinkedIn profiles of the ten people I had to lay off that terrible day.\nAll of them have better jobs. Three are managing partners at\nsignificant industry firms; another is living her lifelong dream of\nsailing around the world; one is a now a judge; one is a stay-at-home\nmom (which, my wife likes to remind me, is the ultimate job)! None of\nthis would have happened if they had stayed at my unprofitable little\ncompany.\n14. Call your employment and/or business attorney. (For a list of\nlawyers who are also PFPs, go to MikeMichalowicz. com and check\nout the Resources section.) These attorneys understand the law, will\nreview your employment agreements and make sure you handle your\nlayoffs properly. Never, and I mean never, proceed with terminations\nor layoffs without talking with your attorney first.\n15. Among the highlighted, boxed expenses, you also have\ncommissions and bonuses for employees, freelancers, etc. Look for\nways to cut down on or remove these costs entirely, but always\nremember that in doing so, you are reducing someone’s pay. Staff or\nfreelancers handed a notice of reduction in income are likely become\ndisgruntled or disheartened; no matter how you deal with it, expect the\nnews to kill morale and weaken productivity.\n16. Start the layoffs. Choose a second person (perhaps your business\npartner, or your HR director, or, if you don’t have anyone in-house,\nbring in your attorney—this is one of the few costs you do want to\nincur) to witness the layoffs and help you explain the situation with\neach employee. Meet with each person. With the approval of your\nattorney, first explain the reason for the layoff to your employee and\nthen provide support that you can afford, like circulating his résumé or\neven paying some severance.\n17. Once each person is laid off, call a staff meeting with all your\nremaining employees. Share what you have done and why you did it.\nExplain how difficult it is to have to do this, and that you take\nresponsibility for both the financial problem you got the company into\nand for fixing it. Assure your team that everyone remaining is here to\nstay, and that you have taken action to immediately stabilize the\ncompany.\nDo not, I repeat do not, ask people to take a pay cut. I did this with dire\nconsequences. Asking all your people to continue to work just as hard or harder\nthan ever for less money is worse for the emotional welfare of your company\nthan letting just one more person go. When I did this, it disheartened the entire\nteam. I was simultaneously telling them to step up for the company and cover\ntheir own work as well as that of the people who had left and that, as a reward\nfor their efforts, I would cut their salary by 10%! They felt disheartened and\nfearful that the cuts would continue. Of the people remaining, nearly half of\nthem started looking for a new job with a more stable company. All of a sudden\nthere were a lot of sick days, and one of my key remaining guys decided not to\nremain. He got a job elsewhere.\nTIME FOR MORE CUTS\n18. Now the hardest part is over, call your bank and tell them to stop\nall automatic withdrawals from all of your accounts, except for any\nthat you have highlighted in Steps 2 and 3. Then notify your vendors\nthat you are stopping the withdrawals and will pay by check going\nforward. I am not suggesting in any way that you should not pay what\nyou owe, or break a commitment. I simply want you to be acutely\naware of every payment you make.\n19. Call each credit card company for which you have a card and ask\nthem to issue you a new card with a new number. Tell the credit card\ncompany that no payments that were being processed on your old card\nshould transfer to your new one. (Many credit card companies do this\nfor you as a convenience, and this is a convenience that you do not\nwant.) You need to do this because your cards have been compromised\n—by you. This step will stop all automatic charges. Then, just as you\ndid in the previous step, notify each vendor that you are putting a halt\nto the automatic charges.\nThose recurring fees can be insidious. I got trapped in a recurring gym\nmembership fee. I would see it on my credit card, and since it was “only $29” a\nmonth, I let it go. I wasn’t going to the gym anymore, but I told myself, “I\nshould go to the gym. I’ll keep the charge because I’ll use it at some time this\nmonth.”\nThen one day my credit card was replaced because of suspicious activity. (I\nwondered if my credit card company was suspicious about how I could be a gym\nmember for so long and a regular McDonald’s customer). The day the card was\ncanceled, the gym membership payment stopped. I had forgotten about the gym\nmembership entirely, and didn’t even notice the charge on my monthly bill.\nWhen the gym called to get a replacement card, I canceled the membership. I got\ncurious about how long I had been auto-paying the gym. Turned out I had only\ngone a total of six times over nearly seventeen months, which breaks down to six\nhours of use for just under $500.\nBut the story doesn’t end here. This is when I realized I wasn’t working out\nnearly enough, so I called some friends and started exercising with them. One of\nthem has a membership to the same gym and can bring a guest for free once a\nweek. Guess who goes with him? I am averaging fifty-plus workouts per year at\nthe same gym now, at no cost. And he is working out more, too, because he has\na motivated workout partner.\nThe point is this: Cutting costs is something that is very easy to put off for\nanother day. It’s the mañana syndrome—I’ll get to it tomorrow. And for me\n(and you too, I suspect) those days of putting things off pile up to a year or more\nvery quickly. You will be unable to put off cutting costs anymore simply by\ngetting your credit cards reissued.\n20. Cut every single circled red expense that you can. Recurring bills\nare sneaky; they seem small and insignificant until you look at how\nmuch you spend cumulatively, over time. To make this even clearer,\nmultiply a monthly recurring bill by twelve. That is what you are\nreally spending. Put a big “X” through each circled expense you\ncancel. If you absolutely can’t get rid of a circled expense, highlight it\non the paper.\n21. Renegotiate the highlighted expenses. Everything is up for\nnegotiation—your rent, your credit card rates and debt, your vendors’\nbills, your software license, your Internet bill, your weight, your\nheight, your age, everything. Your job now is to contact every vendor\nand get your costs reduced in the most significant way possible\nwithout hurting the relationship. Your vendors will not typically be\nhappy with the suggestion of a 50% reduction, so I suggest you start\nby asking for a 25% reduction in the hope of getting a 10% to 15%\nsavings. But don’t just call, do some research first. Find alternative,\nless expensive providers and be prepared to go to the alternatives.\nStart by negotiating the small, necessary expenses. You want to build\nyour negotiation muscle. Build your way up to the bigger expenses.\nNegotiation is a whole topic of its own, but for now, realize that being\na hard-ass isn’t always the most effective approach. Being informed,\nfirm and willing to concede so both sides win is the best method. The\ngoal is to get the same results at a lower cost. It doesn’t mean that you\nneed to stick with what you have and get it more cheaply; you can also\nfind alternatives—a different thing, more cheaply. For example, some\nhotels charge for Internet access in the room and others don’t. If you\ncan’t get a hotel to remove or reduce the in-room Internet charge, get\nthe lobby password and work there.\n22. Put a big check mark next to each highlighted expense you\nsuccessfully negotiate or replace.\n23. Now go through all those expenses that are left on the list. You\nknow, those that you left blank. It’s time to wipe them out. Put a big X\nthrough each expense that you commit to not incurring again—at least\nnot for another two years. You are going to take a sabbatical from\nthese expenses and discover how much your business can accomplish\nwithout unnecessary expenses.\nJob done. And if you made it to your target expense reduction without going on\na bender, I say job well done. Breathe for a few moments. Feel the stress of\noverwhelming expenses leaving you. This was a hard day, but by completing it\nyou have staged yourself for major profits. Now you’re ready to grow your\nbusiness in an efficient way.\nCutting costs is embarrassing. You have a reputation. You always pay for\ndinner, or you drive the nice car. You are the “nice” boss who throws pizza\nparties and gives sweet holiday bonuses. Let me assure you, the relief you feel\nonce you complete the Debt Freeze is way more powerful than the\nembarrassment you fear.\nNo matter how much debt you have, know that there is a way out. More than\nthat, know that you are not the first person to be here. Many people have\nrecovered from dire financial situations and the key to doing that is in your\nhands.\nWe are on a mission to change the perspective of successful business from\n“make a lot” to “save a lot.” The new definition of success is not about the most\nrevenue, employees and office space but the most profit, generated through the\nfewest employees and with the least-expensive office space. Make the game one\nyou win based upon efficiency, frugality and innovation, not on size, flair and\nlooks.\nIF YOU OWE A BANK A MILLION DOLLARS\nThere is a saying in the banking industry: “If you owe a bank a thousand dollars,\nit’s your problem. If you owe the bank a million dollars, it’s their problem.”\nRemember Pete? After our call, he started a Profit Account, cut expenses like\nmad and then called the bank. Almost everything is negotiable, and when you\nowe a bank a million bucks and don’t have it, they’ll listen to your ideas. Pete\nworked out a very doable payment plan, and within three months had already\nwhacked out 5% of the debt and turned a profit. And, he joined an accountability\ngroup. Mine. We have been keeping each other in check for over two years now,\nand while I am vowed to confidentiality about Pete’s progress, let me just say\nthis... it’s been massive. Pete was, understandably, a quivering wreck when he\ncalled me that night two years ago. Today he is the epitome of confidence. And\nPete did it by implementing the power of small actions, a series of consistent\nsmall steps bringing about big results.\nLEAST EFFORT, BIGGEST RESULTS\nYou too must utilize the power of small actions. What is the biggest bang for the\nbuck with the least effort? When it comes to fixing things, we need to build\nemotional momentum. Kinda like going to the gym. If you go back to the gym\nfor the first time in ten years and work out like a mad dog, you may feel great\nthat first day; but within a day or two, you will be so sore and in so much pain,\nyou will likely never go to the gym again. Momentum rarely occurs after one\ncrazy effort. Momentum builds slowly but relentlessly. Small, repetitive,\ncontinuous actions, chained together, build momentous momentum (say that one\nten times fast).\nIn his extraordinary book, The Total Money Makeover, Dave Ramsey explains\nthe “Debt Snowball.” It’s contrary to logic, but plays exactly into the psyche of\nall of us human beings. Ramsey tells us that logic would say to pay off our debts\nwith the highest interest rates first, but that doesn’t build emotional momentum.\nIt is getting to tear up a statement—any statement, because it is fully paid off—\nthat gives you a sense of momentum and gets you charged up to tackle the next\none. Ramsey explains that you should sort all your debts from smallest to\nbiggest, regardless of interest rates. Only when two debts are a similar amount\nshould the one with the highest interest rate be paid first.\nRamsey tells us to pay only the minimum on all the debts, except the one at the\ntop of the list—the smallest one. Then put all your financial power into crushing\nthat first debt as fast as possible. Once that first debt is wiped out, then tackle the\nnext one on the list by adding to the minimum payment with the money you\nwere using to pay the first debt. Once the second debt is paid off, go for the next,\nadding all the money being used to pay the second debt to the minimum of the\nthird. See how the snowball grows? And see how your enthusiasm and\nexcitement about eradicating debt grows? You will get more and more pleasure\nfrom not spending than you once did from spending. Suze and Dave would both\nbe so proud of you.\nBut the trick to Ramsey’s method, and Suze’s, and mine (and anyone with one\niota of sanity) is this: You cannot add new debt as you pay off old. That is just\nshifting money around, paying down one debt while building another. You need\nto get your Debt Freeze on. And then destroy debt, once and for all.\nACTION STEPS\nDOWN WITH DEBT\nStep 1: Start the Debt Freeze. Stop any recurring payments and kill off anything\nyou don’t need. Do whatever it takes to get your “monthly nut” down to 10%\nlower than your Instant Assessment suggests it should be.\nStep 2: Start the Debt Snowball. Pay off your smallest outstanding debt first. As\nyou wipe out each bill with recurring payments, use the freed-up money to tackle\nthe next smallest debt.\nBonus: Join the “How healthy is your business?” club. Make your Profit First tshirt and then post a selfie of you wearing that shirt on Facebook, Twitter or\nGoogle+. Be sure to tag me when you do it.\nCHAPTER SEVEN: Found Money\nI have yet to meet an entrepreneur who hasn’t wanted to hire a “rainmaker”—\nthat magical salesperson who, like the companies that say they can give you\naccess to your great-grandmother Sally’s unclaimed fortune, will save the day by\nbringing in big sale after big sale. Never mind the fact that we, the owners and\nleaders who love our companies and what we do, are the ultimate rainmakers; it\nis this top line approach to solving a cash flow crisis that holds companies back.\nCranking up the sales team in order to “make it rain” is not going to help your\ncompany if you don’t have efficiencies in place, because ultimately, whatever\nnew client revenue you generate will have corresponding costs. And these are\nlikely to go unchecked.\nIf you want to increase profitability (and you’d better friggin’ want to do that),\nyou must first build efficiencies. Focusing solely on increasing sales is like\nsetting up a bunch of rain barrels next to your house and doing some frantic rain\ndance in a loincloth while ignoring a massive water source right beneath your\nfeet.\nTake Idaho, for example. Ninety-five percent of the state’s water supply comes\nfrom underground. The 135 mile-long Big Lost River collects water from the\nRocky Mountains as it winds through Idaho and then just “disappears” as it goes\nsubterranean. The water from Big Lost River, Snake River and other\nunderground water sources collects in the Snake River Aquifer, which measures\n400 miles wide. That is enough water to serve the majority of Idaho’s\nagricultural needs. So that Idaho spud you’re munching on is thanks to an\nunderground water supply—not some rain dance Idahoans learned on the\nInternet (albeit, Idahoans know how to get their funk on), or a band of merry\nfarmers capturing rain in buckets and turned-over cowboy hats.\nWhy should you care about Idaho and its underground lakes? Because 95% of\nyour company’s profitability is contingent on what goes on beneath the surface\n(after the sales), not what happens in the sky (the sales themselves). And it is\nwhat’s going on “underground” that will help you “find” gobs of money.\nWHY EVEN FAT CATS NEED EFFICIENCY\nRecently, I was asked to keynote the Global Student Entrepreneur Awards in\nWashington, DC, where leading collegiate entrepreneurs from all over the world\ngather and are recognized for their incredible impact. At breakfast on the\nmorning of the event, I ended up sitting next to Greg Crabtree. Greg is the author\nof Simple Numbers, Straight Talk, Big Profits. Greg caught my attention\nimmediately, talking with another gentleman at our table about college football.\nI inserted myself into their discussion (“Go Hokies!”), and soon enough the\nconversation drifted from how this team is better than that one to entrepreneurs\nand profitability. I remember thinking: “Hold on—we are talking about college\nfootball and profitability. There is a God!”\nAfter Greg recounted some information he shares in his book about how to\nmaximize profitability, I asked, “Is there such a thing as too much profit? Is\nthere a ceiling?”\n“You always want to expand profit,” Greg replied. “In fact, you must, because\nthere are outside forces that will continually take your profitability away—your\ncompetition. As you find ways to increase profitability, or even if you don’t,\nyour competition is doing the same. Everyone is trying to become more\nprofitable. And as businesses become more profitable, the competitive pressure\nsets in and prices drop to attract more customers.\n“When you figure out a big leap in profitability, the competition will sniff it out,\nand it is just a matter of time before they do the same thing. Then someone drops\nprices to get more clients, and everyone else, including you, has to do the same\nto stay in business. This is how profits get squeezed.”\nWe’ve seen the phenomena Greg outlined over and over. Consider flat-panel\ntelevisions, for example. They became commercially popular in the early 2000s\nbut were still a luxury item until around 2005, when the cost of big screen TVs\nstarted dropping 25% each year. By the end of the decade, vendors had dropped\nthe prices so significantly that it seemed retailers were practically giving them\naway. Then, because manufacturing televisions got easier and easier, profits\njumped, but only for a short time. It wasn’t long before everyone started\ndropping prices again to capture demand, to the point where it now seems as\nthough a retailer needs to pay you to take a small or last year’s flat-panel model.\nJames Li, the chief executive of Syntax Groups—maker of the Olevia brand of\nflat-panel televisions—said of his competitors, “If they go to $3000, I will go to\n$2999.”\nAnother recent example of the profit squeeze phenomenon is the influx of\nInternet marketers. In early 2000, a few guys figured out that you could make a\ncrappy information product, promote it with a grainy video made in your woodpaneled kitchen, email people with a “last chance to purchase” offer and make a\nkilling. The costs were next to nothing—a webcam, a couple PDF files, an email\nmarketing system and really, really bad lighting—and the returns were huge.\nProfits approached nearly 100%, but only for a short time.\nI suspect the early, “Wild West” years of information marketing were amazing\nfor those entrepreneurs, but within five years the landscape changed. Because\nthe industry was known for achieving high sales and record profits, the\ncompetition came in strong. First there was the flood of GRiQs (Get-RichQuickers—the folks who pursue fast, easy money and give up just as quickly\nwhen they find their scheme requires work). Supply quickly started to outstrip\ndemand, and consumers started requiring higher and higher quality. More\nsophisticated marketers started making higher and higher quality stuff, which in\nturn pushed prices down for everyone. That crappy, grainy video and PDF that\nsold for $1997 (supposedly there is something magical about a seven at the end\nof a number) in 2000 now sells for a $1.97 and comes with five years of one-onone coaching in the seller’s wood-paneled office. . . ahem, kitchen. Just as in the\nflat-panel TV business or in any other business, it’s “hard” to become profitable\nin information marketing. And that’s how it always goes.\nProfit is a slippery animal. When profit margins are big, usually in excess of\n20%, people sniff out and almost immediately start to duplicate what you’re\ndoing, and look for ways to do it better, faster, and above all, cheaper than your\ncompany. I’m not, in any way, saying that you should stop investing in\nefficiency and thereby (temporarily) increase profit. I’m saying that even if you\nthink you’re good with profit, you’re not. The competition will squeeze you\neventually, and soon, so keep finding ways to do what you do better, faster and\ncheaper.\nDO THIS FIRST\nBy now you’ve figured out that focusing solely on top line thinking (sales, sales,\nsales!) does not lead to profitability. In fact more sales, without efficiency, lead\nto further inefficiency. In other words, more sales make you less profitable. It’s a\nvicious cycle. So before you can focus on sales, you must first nail Efficiency\n101—and then take a few advanced classes.\nEfficiency increases your profit margins, or, the amount of money you earn as\nprofit on each product or service you offer. It’s basic logic, easier than a\nfreshman math class—increased profit margins will boost your company’s\nprofits without the need for increased sales. And when you do kick the selling\nmachine into gear (which we will discuss in a few), profits will skyrocket. So the\nmethod is simple—achieve greater efficiency first, then sell more, then improve\nefficiencies even more and then sell even more. Over time, speed up the back\nand forth between efficiency and selling until the two happen simultaneously.\nMaking your company more efficient is about more than just nixing extra coffee\nbreaks and redlining your expenses. To tap into the river of profit flowing just\nunder the surface of your company, you need to look at efficiency in every\naspect of your business. Serving the same types of (great) clients with the same\nor very similar problems, using your one consistent solution to fix the problems,\nis the route of efficiencies. You want to duplicate your best clients, because that\nmeans they have a consistent need; and in turn, you want to reduce the variety of\nthings you do to the fewest that will best serve your best clients’ needs. Think\nMcDonald’s. That company is a moneymaking machine because they feed\nhungry people—who don’t care, at least in the moment, about their health as\nmuch as their hunger—with a few products: fries, hamburgers and breaded\nchicken. The fewest things you can do repetitively to serve a consistent core\ncustomer need—this spells efficiency.\nI want you to set a massive goal for yourself. Look at every aspect of your\nbusiness and determine how to get two times the results with half the effort.\nThat’s a biggie, so I will say it again:\nHow do you get two times the results with half the effort?\nEffort is financial cost and time cost (your time, your people’s time, your\nsoftware’s time, your machine’s time). For example, if you own a snowplowing\ncompany and currently plow one parking lot per hour, I would ask you to figure\nout how to plow two parking lots (two times the results) in thirty minutes (half\nthe time). Huge profits can had if you can pull this off—rivers flowing, my\nfriend. Rivers flowing.\nYour first thought might be, “That’s impossible, Mike!” (You wouldn’t believe\nhow often I hear this. Wait. Maybe you would.) If you believe that it’s\nimpossible to increase efficiency in this way, you are trapped in “let the other\nguy figure it out” mode. If instead you say, “Hmm. . . let me think about that.\nLet me find a way,” you will skyrocket to profitability. Why? Because\ninnovation occurs in small steps, big leaps and everywhere in between. To\ndouble the results with half the effort is a big goal that forces big thinking, and it\nbrings about small and big progress—all of which goes to the bottom line.\nThe biggest innovators ask big questions. Do you think Elon Musk asked, “How\ndo I get a few extra miles per gallon?” when he thought up Tesla? Or, “How can\npeople transfer money a little bit faster than a bank wire?” when he started\nPayPal? As he worked on his Hyperloop supersonic speed-train concept—the\none that travels through a complete vacuum system running from LA to San\nFrancisco—do you think he was considering how to be a little bit faster than the\nGreyhound bus? Hell, no! Innovation in business and innovation in efficiencies\ncomes from big, bold questions.\nMost entrepreneurs focus only on tiny improvements—“How do I do this a\ncouple of minutes faster?” Small questions yield small answers. Plowing a\nparking lot five minutes faster is not going to make much of an impact on your\nbottom line. Just skip the coffee break, or just “hold it” when you need to go to\nthe bathroom.\nBut the more you focus on substantially improving efficiency (like with a design\nfor a plow that can move snow twice as fast), the closer you’ll get to achieving\ndouble the results with half the effort. This gain in efficiency is amplified the\nmore you sell. That is the power of percentages. Since you now plow every\nparking lot more efficiently, every new account is an opportunity for increased\nprofit.\nDid you know that United Parcel Service (UPS) trucks almost always take right\nturns? In 2006, UPS dared to ask the efficiency question about fuel costs. They\ndiscovered that the less time UPS drivers spent in left turn lanes, the less fuel\nthey burned waiting at lights and to cross traffic, and the less idle time there was\nfor each driver. UPS is now experiencing a savings of $6,000,000 a year from\nthe change.\nThe “brown truck” company didn’t stop with their first efficiency discovery.\nNext time you see a driver delivering a package, look at him and try to spot his\nkeys. Let me give you a hint: They are not in his pocket (that’s a banana). UPS\ndrivers found that fumbling for their keys in their pockets when they got back\ninto the truck cost them five to ten seconds (or more) every time. UPS figured\nout that it is more efficient to keep their keys hanging from their pinky fingers.\nNow, a UPS driver makes a quick flip of his wrist and the keys are in his hand.\nMultiply that saved five to ten seconds by fifty stops a day and five gazillion\ndrivers and you have a very huge savings indeed.\nUPS also found that they could save millions by washing their trucks once every\ntwo days rather than every day. Over time, this gave them huge savings in time,\nenergy and water—and the trucks looked just as shiny.\nLook, it may seem impossible when you first hear my challenge, but if you’ve\nnever asked yourself, “How can I get two times the results with half the effort?”\nhow will you know if you can? You might be missing your own no-left-turn,\npinky-flip, don’t-wash-yourself efficiency miracle and not even realize it.\nFIRE BAD CLIENTS\nIf you read my book The Pumpkin Plan, you know that, while the book is\noutwardly marketed as a system to help business leaders grow their companies\ninto industry giants, it’s secretly a book about efficiency. Letting go of clients\nwho suck us dry and eat up our profit margins is a way of making space for\nclients we can serve exceptionally well by doing what we do best and with fewer\nresources. It is all about improving not only the top line, but the bottom line, too.\nA study facilitated by Chicago-based growth-consulting firm Strategex analyzed\nthe revenue, cost and profit breakdown for a thousand companies. What they\nfound was nothing short of a “duh” moment, as in the “Duh, I already knew this\nbut I still haven’t done anything about it in my own business because I’m a\nglutton for punishment”-type duh.\nStrategex sorted the clients for each company into four sections, in descending\norder based on revenue. For example, if a company had a hundred clients, the\ntwenty-five clients that generated the most revenue were put in the top quartile,\nthe next twenty-five highest revenue-generating clients in the second quartile,\nand so on. Strategex found that the top quartile generated 89% of the total\nrevenue, while the lowest quartile only accounted for a meager 1% of total\nrevenue.\nWait. It gets worse. The study found that each group of clients required pretty\nmuch the same amount of effort (cost and time). This means that it took the same\namount of effort to serve a big-revenue client as it did a client who barely\naffected revenue at all.\nThen came the awkward “gulp” moment. Strategex’s profit analysis showed that\nthe top quartile generated 150% of a company’s profit. The two middle quartiles\nwere effectively break-even, and the bottom quartile, the one that generated 1%\nof the total revenue, resulted in a profit loss of 50%! In the end, the profits\ngenerated from the top clients are used, in part, to pay for the losses accrued in\nserving the bottom clients.\nI’m sure you know this scenario all too well. Those clients who barely pay you\npeanuts, yet constantly complain about how much you charge and how you do\nnothing right; the clients who demand you rework everything you’ve done for\nthe third time and then never pay you for your work, or never pay you on time—\nthose clients are costing you money. Get rid of them. Fast!\nDumping your worst clients may seem counterintuitive at first. But never forget\nwhat I said earlier: All revenue is not the same. If you remove your worst,\nunprofitable clients and the now-unnecessary costs associated with them, you\nwill see a jump in profitability and a reduction in stress, often within a few\nweeks. Equally important, you will have more time to pursue and clone your\nbest clients. I’ve lost count of how many readers have shared their stories of how\nboth their top line and bottom line improved after they implemented the growth\nstrategies I revealed in The Pumpkin Plan. I know that sounds like bragging, but\nit’s not. The system isn’t some miracle that I came up with; it is just simple\nmath.\nI know how scary it feels to dump any client when you are scrambling to cover\nthis week’s payroll, especially if you fought hard to get that client in the first\nplace. But remember, profit is about the percentages, not a single number. So\ntake it easy on yourself. Start by dumping one rotten little pumpkin in your\npatch, the one you occasionally fantasize about leaving on a deserted island or\nshipping off to Mars. The emotional distraction that client caused you and your\nstaff will disappear immediately. The profits you earned from other clients and\nwere spending to keep this bad client on board will now stay in your pocket. And\nsince his special requirements no longer need to be serviced, you have time and\nheadspace to find another, better client—an ideal client, a clone of your very\nbest clients.\nCLONE YOUR BEST CLIENTS\nJust for a moment, I want you to think of your favorite client: the call you will\nalways take, the person or company you say yes to without hesitation. This is the\nclient who pays you what you’re worth, on time, without question. This is the\nclient who trusts you, respects you, and follows instructions. This is the client\nyou love, and they love you. Now imagine if this client had five identical twin\ncompanies that all wanted to work with you. Wouldn’t that boost your business?\nWouldn’t it be easy to serve those clients? Wouldn’t it help you keep your\nbottom line healthy? Now imagine ten clones, or a hundred clones.\nFor almost any B2B business in the world, landing a hundred clones of their best\nclient would put them at the front of the pack. They would dominate. The same\nis true for B2C businesses. If just a mere 10% of their clients behaved like their\nnumber one client, those businesses would rule, too.\nHaving clients with similar needs and very similar behaviors offers a few\nmagical profit-making benefits:\n1. You will become super-efficient, because you now serve very few\nbut consistent needs, rather than an excessive array of varying needs.\n2. You will love working with your clones, which means you will\nnaturally and automatically provide better service. We cater to the\npeople we care about.\n3. Marketing will become automatic. Birds of a feather flock together\n(for real) and that means your best clients hang out with other business\nleaders who have the “best client” qualities you’re looking for. Your\nbest clients are awesome, remember? You love them and they love\nyou, and that means they will talk you up every chance they get.\nClones of your best clients are the very definition of efficiency, which is why\nthey are like gold. Find them. Nurture them. And then find out where even more\nbest-client clones hang out and cultivate them, too.\nSELL SMART\nI mentioned Ernie briefly already, but I want you to know a little more about his\nstory. It speaks to how fast things can go down the “upselling” rabbit hole. In the\nfall, I pay my lawn service to come clean up all of the leaves in our yard. This\npast year, Ernie, the owner of the business, knocked on my door. He had just\nfinished the leaf clean-up and said, “I noticed that there are leaves in the\ngutters.” He offered to remove them, for a fee. And I, my friends, was what they\ncalled a “captive customer” and an “easy upsell.”\nI said, “Yes, do it,” without any hesitation.\nErnie had just expanded his service offering. Easy money. Yippee. To complete\nthe job, Ernie had to run out and buy some ladders for his truck. He came back\nthirty minutes later and got right to work. Because he pulled out the leaves by\nhand, he wasn’t super efficient, but he got it done fast enough. However, he\ndidn’t have the tool to snake out the downspouts, so he made a note to buy it and\ncome back at a later date to finish the job.\nWhile Ernie was up on the roof, he spotted another opportunity— fixing\ndamaged shingles. More easy money! More revenue! Again he asked me, I said\nyes and he ran out and picked up some roofing tools (and a downspout snake\ntool thingy). He came back an hour later, replaced the shingles, cleaned the\ndownspouts—and, while doing that work, noticed a crack in the chimney and a\nsoft spot on the roof, a sign of rotting wood. When Ernie approached me about\nit, I asked him to fix those things, too. This time he went out to get more tools,\nband saws, cement, brick supplies and temporary labor. Ernie came back near\nthe end of the day and pushed through to get it finished. He even bought\nfloodlights to keep the work area lit as dusk approached.\nAt the end of the day, I paid $1500 for all the work. Not a bad deal, considering\nErnie “only” gets paid $200 to clean the lawn. But… the $1500 he earned cost\nErnie an investment of about $2000 for tools and supplies that day, plus a lot of\ndriving back and forth and the cost of hiring a laborer.\nErnie lost money on me, but he grew his sales by a lot. Tomorrow he intends to\nuse his new equipment and tools to take care of other clients and will, in theory,\nearn his money back and then some. The problem is, that rarely happens. As the\nbills mount, the pressure grows to sell more and more; and you end up working\non projects in which you have limited experience and sometimes little interest.\nAs the variety of things you do increases, you need to buy more tools and\nequipment and hire more specialized labor. And none of this gets used to its\nmaximum potential, because you do many different things, not one thing. Your\nstuff sits there unused. While you rake lawns, your ladders just lie there. As you\nfix roofs, the leaf blowers just sit in your truck.\nYou get stuck in the Survival Trap and end up not doing a very good job at any\none thing. For example, when Ernie wrapped up for the day he said, “I’ll be back\nearly tomorrow to clean the lawn again.” Why? Because he threw the leaves\nfrom the gutters onto the lawn he had just cleaned, as well as shingles and other\nthings. His additional work required that he actually redo his original work,\nwhile all that new gear he bought just sat on his truck, not being used. What’s\nefficient about that? Nada.\nAcross the street, my neighbors Bill and Liza hire a different guy, Shawn, to\nclean up their leaves in the fall. He also charges $200. On the same day Ernie\nworked on my house and earned $1500, Shawn serviced four more properties\nand also knocked on the doors at two other properties that, by the look of their\nlawns, needed his help.\nI suspect that if Ernie and Shawn had had a beer together that night, Ernie would\nhave boasted about doing one-and-a-half times the sales Shawn pulled, but\nShawn would have ended up paying for the drinks. Shawn has achieved\nefficiency, and recognizes it as the magical sauce of profitability—getting more\nof the same things done with better and better results, using fewer and fewer\nresources.\nSelling more is the most difficult way to increase profits, because in the bestcase scenarios, the percentages stay the same; and in the worst-case, more\ncommon scenarios, expenses generated to support sales increase faster, resulting\nin smaller percentages and a smaller profit margin.\n• • •\nA man went in search of the perfect picture frame at a flea market in\nAdamstown, Pennsylvania in 1989. He found it holding a torn painting of a\ncountry scene. When he got home and dismantled the frame, he determined that\nit was not salvageable. But something else was.\nFolded and hidden in the backing was the Declaration of Independence. Five\nhundred official copies had been used to spread the news of America’s\nindependence to everyone in the twelve colonies, and John Dunlap had printed\nthis specific copy on July 4th, 1776. The man who found it took actions both to\nsell it and to remain unidentified. I’m not surprised—that $4 frame purchase\nturned over to 2.4 million dollars two years later, when it was sold by Sotheby’s\nto a private investor.\nThe guy looking for the frame is a success by any measure, right? He found the\nmoney under the surface. But if you think of him as a success, you’re wrong.\nSure, stumbling across success is cool, but making a process for finding profits\nunder the surface is the real success.\nThis guy figured out that there is potentially big money hidden in frames. But if\nhe only hopes to find another historical document one day, he is hoping for it to\nrain, not pursuing efficiency by identifying regions where such documents\noriginated and searching flea markets only in those areas, focusing on frames\nmade during a specific time period and buying inspection tools to look through\nthe frames to see if there is anything inside. Can you imagine combing the flea\nmarkets without these and other efficiencies in place? He’d go broke trying to\nfind that elusive rare document, trying to make it rain.\nSales without first putting efficiency measures and systems in place is a\ndangerous game that only leads to bigger expenses and fewer ideal clients.\nApplying efficiency strategies to your top line—firing bad clients, cloning the\ngood ones, refining your offering to get the most out of your resources and then\nselling smart—is a surefire way to increase profitability.\nACTION STEPS\nLET GO OF DEAD WEIGHT\nStep One: Focusing on one aspect of your business (one that benefits your best\ncustomers), challenge yourself to figure out how to get two times the results for\nhalf the effort. Just pick one component and figure it out. Set a goal of\naccomplishing this task for a different aspect of your business every week, until\nyou’ve looked at the full scope of your company and found ways to ensure you\nare running it with maximum efficiency. Shoot for the stars and you just might\nhit the moon.\nStep Two: Using the parameters outlined in this chapter, identify your weakest\nclients. Fire the weakest links. I’m not suggesting that you get into ‘Take This\nJob and Shove It” mode. Don’t burn any bridges. Just politely end the\nrelationships. You’re not dating anymore, but you can still be friends.\nCHAPTER EIGHT: Sticking With It\nAs I write this, we’re having a mother of a bad winter here on the East Coast. I\nhear other parts of the country also have it rough, but I’ve been snowbound in\nmy house for what seems like eighty-four years, afraid to turn on the Weather\nChannel in case I might finally, permanently lose my mind. I’m not sure which\nstate has had the worst of it, but while my heart feels it is Jersey, I’m pretty sure\nit’s Minnesota. Actually, I’m convinced it’s Minnesota.\nThe other day I caught up with Anjanette Harper, one of my best pals and the\nbest damn writer on this planet, who lives across the border in New York. We\nwere trading war stories over the phone about how the latest storm had affected\neach of our towns when she said, “Mike, I survived a mile-long hike in the\nMinnesota Northwoods… in January. We were sent out in waist-deep snow with\nnothing but a compass, some matches and a bag of granola. This winter has\nnothing on me.”\nAnjanette went on to tell me a hilarious story about Camp Widjiwagan (yes,\nthat’s its real name), a winter camp she attended with her classmates near Ely,\nMinnesota when she was thirteen.\n“It was ridiculous—we were this group of private school kids from the city sent\nto an environmental camp way up north during the coldest month of the year.\nWe weren’t allowed to use the one indoor bathroom except to brush our teeth—\nseriously, the toilet seat had duct tape over it—instead, we had to put on three\nlayers of clothes plus outerwear to trek out to the biffies (outhouses) in the\nwoods to pee. I could barely walk in all of those layers, and it seemed like the\nbiffies were miles away. I’m surprised my eyeballs didn’t get frostbite. Just try\ngoing to the bathroom in the middle of a pitch-black night on a frozen toilet seat\nin a tiny wooden shack, with two active wolf packs howling at each other\nnearby.”\nI laughed so hard as Anjanette went on to tell me about a blind hike on a frozen\nlake (soundtrack: wolves!), building a quinzhee (an igloo), and putting up with\nearnest environmentalists who had no sympathy for the plight of pubescent\nteenagers not permitted to wash their hair. But it wasn’t until she explained how\nthe counselors managed to get the campers to change their wasteful habits that I\nrealized I had to share her story with you.\n“The first night, after we had dinner, we were asked to scrape the leftover food\non our plates into a bucket. I assumed it was because they wanted to feed our\nscraps to some special breed of pig that could survive in the tundra, but then I\nsaw the scale. One of the counselors weighed our combined leftovers and\nannounced that we had managed to waste several pounds of food.\n“Being a bunch of privileged brats, we responded with, ‘Yeah, so?’ “And then\nwe were lectured about how a few pounds of waste, repeated daily, adds up to a\nfew tons of waste, and soon enough that adds up to a few landfills full of waste.\nNext, we got the ultimatum: We had to get the waste-per-meal down to a few\nounces by the end of the week. I can’t remember what the exact consequence\nwas if we didn’t pull it off, but it was something outrageous, like forcing us to\nsquare dance. . . with each other.”\nAnjanette went on to explain how, in the days that followed, she and her\nclassmates held each other accountable for the amount of food they left on their\nplates at the end of each meal. They strategized and came up with solutions—the\nmost important of these was to take smaller portions to begin with.\n“We helped each other out,” Anjanette explained. “If, after I was done eating, I\nstill had vegan mashed potatoes on my plate and Ted and Brian wanted second\nhelpings, I would pass them my leftovers. We nudged each other (or shouted at\neach other, take your pick) when our plates were piled too high with food.\nToward the end, when it looked like we might not reach our goal, we really put\nthe pressure on each other. Because, let’s face it—we’d just hit puberty. We\nwould have done anything to avoid having to touch each other, much less partner\nup for a square dance.”\nBy the last dinner, Anjanette and her fellow campers surprised even themselves\n—they got that bucket down to zero waste. Zero. Zilch. Squat. As in, no one\nneeds to do anything with the two words that should never be said together. . .\nsquare and dance.\nWhen I asked Anjanette if any of the eco-friendly lessons she learned at Camp\nWidjiwagan stayed with her, she said, “I still turn off the water when I brush my\nteeth. And I’m more likely to shop for a few days’ worth of groceries rather than\nstock up, because I despise throwing out food. So yeah, it stuck. I mean, I never\nwant to see a snowshoe again, and the only school event for my son that I ever\nintentionally missed was the square dance; but it did change the way I think\nabout using our natural resources.”\nIn essence, what Anjanette and her friends did was form an accountability group\nto ensure they met their goal. I’m a huge fan of accountability groups because\nthe benefits are numerous. Chief among them:\n1. When you go through a painful process with others, the pain is\ndiminished.\n2. The action of enforcing a plan or system with someone else ensures\nthat you are more likely to do your part. You are accountable to the\ngroup, and therefore integral to the group, which means you are less\nlikely to drop the ball.\n3. When you meet regularly with an accountability group, you get into\na rhythm that makes it easier to stay the course and achieve your goal.\nBig aspirational goals get broken down into smaller achievable\nmilestones.\nThe worst enemy of Profit First is not the economy, or your staff, or your\ncustomers, or your mother-in-law. Well, maybe it is your mother-in-law. . . but I\ndigress. The worst enemy of Profit First is you. The system is simple, but you\nhave to have the discipline to implement it consistently. If you do this, your\ncompany will be profitable, no question about it. The problem is, we are own\nworst enemies. We won’t do the Debt Freeze all the way (or at all). We won’t\ncut back on our staffing expenses or move into a grade -D office space. And we\nwill steal from ourselves, taking money we allocate for profit to pay bills. We\nwill steal from our Tax Accounts to pay our own salaries. We’ll borrow. We’ll\nbeg. We’ll steal (from ourselves). And we will find a way to justify it all, at least\nto ourselves. This is why it is imperative that we join (or start) an accountability\ngroup… immediately. Otherwise, there will be hefty consequences to our actions\n. . . and I guarantee they won’t be as easy to face as forced square dancing.\nACCOUNTABILITY GROUPS WORK\nThomas Edison said, “Genius is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration.” I’m sure\nhe would agree that success with Profit First is also 1% inspiration and 99%\nperspiration. It is in doing that things get done, and in sticktoitenacity (yes, I\nmade up a word) that results are achieved.\nAnd I’m convinced Jean Nidetch would agree with good ol’ Edison. Nidetch\nfounded Weight Watchers in the 1960s, not with the intention of creating a\nwildly successful business, but with the goal of fixing a problem. (Isn’t that how\nmost great companies begin?) Throughout her childhood, Nidetch struggled with\nher weight. The problem continued and, by age thirty-nine, she weighed 214\npounds. Nidetch sure as heck didn’t wear her weight like bikini model Amazon\nEve, either.\nAfter a run-in with a neighbor at the supermarket, Nidetch was finally motivated\nto lose weight. As the story goes, her neighbor complimented her on her\nappearance and then asked, “How exciting! When are you due?”\nNot pregnant, Nidetch decided enough was enough. She started a diet\nrecommended by a nutritionist and lost 20 pounds. Then, like so many of us, she\nlost her resolve.\nRealizing she needed help, Nidetch reached out to several of her friends who\nwere also trying to lose weight and founded a weekly support group. With the\nhelp of the group she lost another 52 pounds. All her friends lost weight too.\nThat group eventually became Weight Watchers.\nNidetch celebrated her ninetieth birthday in 2013, having enjoyed more than\nfifty years of good health thanks to a sound nutritional system for losing weight\nand an accountability group to help ensure that she met her goals and never\ngained the weight back.\nThe science behind losing weight is simple: Consistently eat fewer calories than\nyour body burns. Just as with Profit First, however, if your resolve falters, the\nsystem falls apart. This is why everyone— including me, including you—needs\nan accountability group. I don’t care how disciplined you are, at times your\nwillpower will fade. You need other people who are working the same system to\nhelp you stick to it during your toughest times, and will help you to help others\ndo the same.\nWeight Watchers meetings are facilitated by trained leaders using an established\ncurriculum. These leaders have lost weight following the Weight Watchers\nsystem. They don’t just teach it, they live it.\nThe fact that accountability groups work is nothing new. In fact, churches use\nthem to help keep members focused on their faith. In The Power of Habit by\nCharles Duhigg, he explains how Rick Warren, a Baptist pastor, created his\ncongregation. When Warren realized that his weekly motivational sermons were\nnot enough to keep people focused on the lesson during the week and better able\nto meet challenges, he implemented small Bible study groups. His sermons were\nreminders of the lessons of their faith (a system of its own) and the small groups\nhelped his congregation to stay focused on the lessons and implement them in\ndaily life. Soon, 95% of Warren’s church activity was happening during the\nweek, in the small accountability groups.\nIncidentally, Thomas Edison was part of accountability/ mastermind group with\nHenry Ford, Harvey Firestone and John Burroughs. They called themselves “The\nFour Vagabonds,” and though the group began as a camping tour, it was really\nmuch more. Together they mastered entrepreneurial domination and the everelusive secret trick to making a perfectly toasted marshmallow.\nKnowing Profit First is only 5% of the game. To win it, you need the other 95%\n—and you’ll get that in your accountability group.\nGET STARTED\nBy now you know my philosophy on getting started—why wait? Do it now! To\nmake it easier for you to get involved in your own accountability group, I’ve\noutlined the types of groups you could join, or start.\nPROFIT ACCELERATOR GROUPS\nProfit Accelerator Groups (PAGs) are facilitated by Profit First Professionals\n(PFPs), financial professionals or business coaches who are trained in the Profit\nFirst system, use it in their own businesses and help other entrepreneurs and\nleaders to implement it in their own companies. PAGs meet monthly or\nquarterly, face-to-face, at a Profit Center, at your (or another member’s) facility\nor at their own dedicated facility. Some meetings take place over online\nvideoconferencing.\nPFPs have established, proven track records in fiscal/business management; they\nare accountants, bookkeepers, business coaches, business attorneys, financial\nplanners and bankers. They also have access to the latest Profit First resources\nand know how to use them. PFPs enforce accountability and profitability;\nfacilitate the sharing of best practices; and direct members on debt reduction,\ncost reduction and building efficiencies.\nWhy is working with a PFP an advantage? It’s like working out with a\nprofessional trainer—you’re going to get where you’re going faster and more\nsafely and efficiently. PFPs can guide you through the nuances of applying\nProfit First to your business, drawing on their expertise in working with many\ntypes of businesses and sets of special circumstances. PFPs have gone through\nthis process many, many times, and that cumulative experience means they have\nalready seen all the roadblocks you will face and are well-equipped to help you\nget around them.\nIf you would prefer to work with a PFP outside of an accountability group, most\nof them work one-on-one as well. PFPs do charge for their time, but man-ohman is it ever worth it. Debra Courtright, the bookkeeper I mentioned in Chapter\n1, is a PFP. She runs accountability meetings in her office; I was a member of\none of the groups and met in her office for more than a year. No surprise, the\nentrepreneurs in her groups get to their financial objectives faster than most\nbusiness leaders I’ve met.\nAccountability works. Having a professional give you good shortcuts specific to\nyour business works even better—it accelerates your profitability.\nMichael Agulario of Gold Medal Services runs a $25,000,000 company and is in\na PAG facilitated by his PFP, an accountant. One of the added benefits\nMichael’s PFP brings to the group is, he offers to be the “bad cop” in vendor\nnegotiations. Michael brings his PFP along to every meeting with vendors who\nare expensive but necessary to an efficient, profitable business. Then, Michael\nplays “good cop” while his PFP plays “bad cop” in order to get the best deal—\nsometimes saving hundreds of thousands in the process.\nFor example, after a pitch from his Yellow Pages sales rep, Michael said,\n“Sounds great. I want it.”\nBut his PFP went all “bad cop” and said, “Michael, this is ridiculous. You can’t\nafford this, or justify it. I want you to cancel the service.”\nBecause Michael conceded to his PFP, the sales rep offered a lower price—\nslicing his Yellow Pages bill by $500,000! And he got double the run time for\nhis ads. This negotiation is no different from any other, but Michael stays the\n“good cop” and can remain on friendly terms with his vendor.\nFor a list of PFPs, including those who run PAGs in your area, visit\nMikeMichalowicz.com/Resources.\nPROFIT PODS\nAn alternative to joining a PAG run by a PFP is to join or start a voluntary Profit\nPod. These groups are led by Profit Leaders, entrepreneurs who decided to start\na Profit Pod as a way to help themselves remain accountable and help their\ncolleagues do the same. While Profit Leaders do not run financial businesses, are\nnot business coaches and have not been trained in Profit First best practices, they\ndo have a passion for profitability.\nThe format for Profit Pod meetings is open source, but there are rules. Profit\nLeaders may not charge for the meetings except to cover any outright,\ndocumented costs (such as Meetup.com fees, room rental or food), and they may\nnot solicit your business (nor may any of the members solicit business from\nother participants).\nBecause Profit Pods are open source, they are one hundred percent independent.\nTo find one in your area, search the web, check out Meetup.com, BigtTent.com,\nMightybell Circles or Facebook groups, or ask in entrepreneurs’ forums. Group\nmembers enforce the Profit Pod rules, so if you’re not happy with how a\nparticular group is being run, give them an honest critique and leave the group.\nThen join a new Profit Pod, or better yet, start your own and run it the right way.\nPROFIT LEADERS\nBecoming a Profit Leader and starting your own group can be a fantastic way to\nensure you not only are accountable to the Profit First system, but also are\ngaining the most from knowledge and experience as you tweak it to suit your\ncompany’s needs.\nAt a recent speaking engagement on a local college campus, I asked my friend\nJB Blanchard to join me. JB had implemented Profit First in his roof-decking\ncompany, RoofDeck Solutions, Ltd., and wanted to share his experience with the\nstudents and professors in attendance. As we hustled over to the event, we\npassed a classroom.\nJB pointed into the room and mumbled, “There he is. There’s the best student.”\nBecause I was mentally rehearsing my speech, I didn’t ask him what he meant\nby that.\nWe walked by another classroom and he blurted, “There’s the best student,”\npointing into the very full room.\nThat got my attention.\nAs I turned to ask him his criteria for identifying the best student, JB pointed\ninto another classroom and said, “Over there, that woman. She is the best student\nin the room.”\nI stopped walking and looked at JB. “What are you talking about? How can you\npick out the best students so quickly?”\n“Easy,” he said. “The best student is always the teacher.”\nAhh, yes. This is why we teach—to learn, and to master. This is, in part, why\nWeight Watchers has such an amazing track record helping people lose weight\nand keep it off. Jean Nidetch, the founder, doesn’t run the meetings or conduct\nteleconference after teleconference. No, her best members are the facilitators—\nher best students are the teachers.\nProfit First is no different. If you want to master Profit First for your business,\nyou need to teach it. Become a Profit Leader.\nTo make it easy for you to start your own Profit Pod, I’ve created a structure for\nyou to follow (see below) and a Profit Pod Starter Kit, which includes\ninstructions and core guidelines for how the meetings are run. You can\ndownload your own free copy at MikeMichalowicz. com/Resources.\nSTARTING A PROFIT POD—JUST TWO\nThe fastest Profit Pod to start only has two members—you and one other\nentrepreneur. The meetings are easy to manage and are over quickly. However,\nwith a group this small you will not have the input of a financial expert or the\npower of input from a group of people. (Note: You cannot do this with a\nbusiness partner or anyone who has a vested interest in your business.)\nEveryone knows that you’re more apt to show up to the gym if you have a\nworkout partner there waiting for you. You might even work harder because you\nare there with your partner. But don’t pick just anybody—your Profit First\nbuddy has to want profitability as badly as you do. They have to “get it.”\nWithout shared values, passion and determination, meeting up with your Profit\nFirst mate would be a bit like meeting your workout partner at Dunkin’ Donuts.\nSo pick someone who wants a healthy, profitable business just as much as you\ndo. Better yet, find someone who wants it more.\nWhen you partner up, become champions for each other. Yet be aware that,\nwhen there are only two of you, it is easier to get away with little white lies. We\nsay, “Yes, I put the money into the account,” when really we only intended to\nput it in, but never followed through.\nThe goal of accountability is to be integral to your Profit First system, not to\npunish each other for doing (or not doing) certain things. Instead, look for ways\nto improve discipline and cheer each other on for following the system. For\nexample, you may decide that, rather than tell each other you made the deposit,\nyou will email screenshots of your bank accounts to each other before your\nmeeting or, if you’re meeting in person, bring a print-out.\nA Profit Pod of just two should meet on the phone, Skype or face-to-face twice a\nmonth. It’s best to meet on the 11th and 26th (or whatever convenient day comes\nsoon after you do your 10/25 Rhythm). When you meet, share your profit status;\ndiscuss any problems; share tips and tricks you have found for improving\nprofitability and sticking with it; and hold yourselves accountable to tasks that\nwill drive profitability.\nHere’s how to form a Profit Pod with just two members:\n1. What you want in a partner is someone you already know but are\nnot friends with. Inviting friends to join your group can lead to some\nmessy stuff. I get it—you know your friends. You go way back. You\nwant them to succeed. But trust me when I say that including your\nfriends in your Pod is not the way to maximize the experience. You\nneed honest communication between members who have no reason to\nbe jealous or hurt, or to gossip to mutual friends about what they might\nhave heard you share in the meeting. So choose a business\nacquaintance, someone you know delivers on commitments (that way\nyou will be less likely to break yours).\n2. If you prefer to work with someone you don’t know, look online.\nSearch Google for “Entrepreneur Online Forum” for a list of forums,\nand when you find one that is particularly active, post an inquiry in the\nforum for an accountability partner. Be very specific about what you\nwant to do (e.g., have a call every two weeks, support each other in\nprofitability, etc.). One of my personal favorites is The Fastlane\nForum, managed by entrepreneur and business author MJ DeMarco.\nInterview prospects the same way you would a potential hire, asking\nwhatever questions you feel are necessary to ensure confidence in this\nperson. Be smart. Get references.\n3. Another option is to post a tweet or Facebook status update: “I am\nlooking for an accountability partner to focus on business profits.”\nYou will find some amazing people, and by using this method you will\nbe able to weed out people who are interested but not committed.\nWhen I posted this same message on Twitter, two people responded\nwith interest within a few minutes. I deliberately did not respond—\nafter all, a good accountability partner is persistent. You know what? I\nnever heard from those two people again. And just like that, they were\noff my list of potential partners.\nHere is the core structure for running a Profit Pod with two people:\n1. Schedule biweekly meetings around the 11th and 26th to correspond\nwith your 10/25 Rhythm. A key factor in maintaining a successful Pod\nis to schedule your meetings a full year out, and then schedule your\nlife around them. If you wait until you are both available to meet, you\nwon’t meet often enough for the group to work its magic.\n2. Even with just two members, choose who will lead the agenda. The\nagenda for a fifteen-minute meeting is as follows:\na. Instant Profit First CheckIn: In turn, each partner asks, “How\nhealthy is your business?” and the other partner replies with a onesentence assessment.\nb. Three-Minute Update: Partner One gives a three-minute update\nabout her business, including the thing(s) they agreed to be\naccountable about from the prior call, with no discussion.\nc. Profit First Report: Partner One gives an update on current balances\nin her Profit Account, Tax Account and, if you have agreed to share\nthe information, the Owner’s Pay Account. Also, Partner One reports\nhow much money was allocated to each account since the last meeting.\nThis is the ideal time to email a screen shot of the relevant balances, to\navoid cheating yourself.\nd. Challenges Report: Partner One shares any struggles she may be\nhaving in allocating funds, and any potential problems or roadblocks\nthat may be coming down the pike. If there are no challenges to report,\nsimply say so.\ne. Wins! Report: Partner One shares new “wins” and findings that may\nhave happened in her business since the last meeting (e.g., ways to\nincrease profits, methods for better adherence to Profit First, new\nsales, new processes, increased Profit First percentage, etc.).\nf. Discussion: To get clarity, Partner Two asks Partner One up to three\nquestions about her challenges and then asks for commitments to\nsolutions. Partner Two then asks up to three questions about Partner\nOne’s wins, and for commitments to how she will repeat and grow\nthem. The goal here is not to give advice or fix each other’s problems;\nit is simply to put accountability in place.\ng. Now, flip.\nh. In turn, Partner One and Two each close with a commitment of up\nto three actions to further serve the health of their companies. Confirm\nthe next call and get to work.\n3. Every quarter, when you take a distribution, acknowledge your\npartner. Share how you plan to celebrate with your profits, no matter\nthe amount. Give each other a virtual high five. Discuss ways to\nimprove your accountability. The outline above can get boring quickly\nif you simply repeat it at every meeting, so think about ways you\nmight freshen up the process. For example, you might start reading a\nbook together. (Cough. The Pumpkin Plan. Cough.) When you have\nyour call every two weeks, discuss another chapter from the book and\nhow you will (or won’t) implement the ideas.\nSTARTING A PROFIT POD/PROFIT ACCELERATOR GROUP—THREE\nTO TEN\nA group of two members is easy to form, but if one person misses a meeting or\nstarts to slack, the group is done. And, with only two members you are limited to\ninput from. . . well, just the two of you. There is power in numbers. With three to\nten members you have input from several people, and you have a chance to\nrotate Profit Leaders. Phil Tirone, my friend the former mortgage lender and\nfounder of 720CreditScore.com, founded my accountability group. There are ten\nof us in the group, and though Phil got us started, he doesn’t lead alone. We\nrotate leadership responsibilities every quarter, and this process has truly\nelevated the group. It also breaks us out of doing the same thing all the time.\nThese groups have the feel of advisory boards.\nStarting a Profit Pod or PAG of three to ten members can be a bit like herding\ncats. And if your group starts networking and conducting business together,\nthings can go sour. So be sure to clearly state the rules of the group and make\nsure that everyone abides by them. Many PFPs facilitate groups of this size, so\nconsider joining one of these professionally-run groups and getting their\ndirection on running your own Pod.\nYou can use the same tools for finding your members detailed in the section\nabove. Also, if you are in an existing group, consider plugging Profit First\naccountability into your existing core structure. For example, I have been a\nmember of Entrepreneurs’ Organization and in a forum (a blend of a mastermind\nand an accountability group, typically six to ten men and women) for fifteen\nyears. We added Profit First to our group’s agenda—a simple fifteen-minute\nplug-in—and it’s been working well for everyone.\nAs is true of groups with only two members, the goal of the group is to work\nwith other entrepreneurs and business owners who are committed to building\nprofitable organizations, supporting each other in the process and holding each\nother accountable.\nHere is the core structure for how to run a Pod or PAG with three to ten people:\n1. After participating in accountability groups and masterminds of all\nsizes I have found that, for what we need to achieve, the best format is\nquarterly face-to-face meetings and biweekly rapid-fire checkins (see\ncore structure above for the rapid-fire checkin agenda). The biweekly\ncheckin (45 minutes long) is necessary because business changes\nconstantly. All of our wonderful plans go out the window when a\nclient suddenly goes bye-bye, and we need the biweekly checkin to\nmake adjustments and deal with challenges. The quarterly meetings\nallow for a deep dive to support each other at a much more tactical\nlevel.\n2. First Meeting: When a new group forms or a new member joins an\nexisting group, it is critical to establish a strong, deep connection\nimmediately. Now, before you say this can’t be done, try getting stuck\nin an elevator with someone you don’t know for an hour—you will\nbecome best of buddies for life. It can be done; it just needs to be\nstructured correctly. Allow an hour and a half for a first meeting if you\nare meeting often, and if you are doing a deep-dive group, allow four\nhours.\n3. Master Exercise: I will never forget my first deep-dive\naccountability meeting back in 2011. Our group decided we would\nstart with an exercise called “Full Financial Disclosure.” I call it\n“Getting Naked.” We agreed to walk into the meeting with our tax\nreturns, bank statements, loan statements, credit card statements—all\nthat stuff we normally wouldn’t want a business colleague to see. Talk\nabout a bonding exercise!\n4. No Business: You may not do business with each other. You can\nrefer work, you can help each other, and you can give freebies if you\nmust (I suggest avoiding that), but no matter what, no money changes\nhands. Not only do things go sour if there is a problem (and it will\naffect the whole group), but complete honesty also goes away because\nyour vendor or client is now in the room.\nOn my website, I share detailed examples of agendas for first meetings, checkins\nand deep-dive meetings. To download the agendas, visit\nMikeMichalowicz.com/Resources.\nPROFIT CENTERS\nAfter I started centering some of my speeches on Profit First, large businesses\napproached me. They wanted in. From my early conversations with these\nbusinesses, an idea was spawned for Profit Centers: locations in which small and\nlarge businesses provide free space for face-to-face PAG and Profit Pod\nmeetings. Many banks, for example, have conference rooms (and lollipops).\nSome corporations have auditoriums (and lunchrooms). What better way to have\na meeting than at one of the bank branches? After you wrap up the meeting, you\ncan each walk up to the teller and make your Profit First deposit, or your\nquarterly withdrawal for your Profit First celebration!\nThen other corporations approached me, wanting to offer discounts on their\nproducts and services. They realize that a Profit Pod represents great clients for\nthem (hey, big business needs to be profitable too), and that it is effectively a\nsmall buying club.\nFor a current list of Profit Centers, visit MikeMichalowicz.com/Resources. If\nyou don’t see a conference meeting space in your area (or services and products\nthat you want at a lower cost point), simply contact me and we will work to get\none listed.\nKEEP THE GROUPS HONEST!\nIn Dan Ariely’s book The (Honest) Truth About Dishonesty, he explains how we\nlie to everyone, including—or, says Ariely, especially— ourselves. In short, he\nexplains how, if given the opportunity, most people will cheat a little. Few\npeople are big cheaters—the kind you see on America’s Most Wanted—but\neveryone is a small cheater. We call our cheats “little white lies” to soften the\ntruth and make ourselves feel better about cheating, but it’s still cheating.\nWeight Watchers meetings kick off with a weigh-in. You step on the scale and\nthe facilitator notes your weight; you are the only two people who see it. There is\nno public embarrassment, but also no opportunity to lie. Ultimately, you come\nout winning because you can’t lie to yourself.\nYou can’t lie with Profit First, either—not to your peers and not to yourself. This\nis how we make sure small cheats and little white lies don’t happen in a PAG:\nEach member must bring the printed-out statement from his Profit Account to\neach meeting. (Or, if you are meeting online, send a screenshot via email.)\nNumbers do not lie, even if we are tempted to do just that. (Just a teensieweensie bit.)\nJust as it works with Weight Watchers, you don’t need to show your number to\nthe entire group. You just need to share it with your PFP if you’re in a\nprofessionally facilitated PAG. If you are in a volunteer Profit Pod, your group\nneeds to designate one person to be the number validator. By sharing this\nindisputable evidence with one person other than yourself, you won’t be able to\nlie to anyone (including yourself).\n• • •\nMy friend Anjanette is the sarcastic sort, and she likes to tell a funny story. But\nwhen she came to the end of her tale about Camp Widjiwagan, her tone changed.\nWe had been talking about this book, and about how I had already decided I\nwanted her to let me share her story with you as an example of how\naccountability groups can help people stick with the program. She agreed and\nsaid, “You know, Mike, I joked about it, but the thing is, that trip to Camp\nWidjiwagan changed my life.”\nWhen I asked how, she explained that she had always been the pudgy girl—the\nkid picked last for teams, the girl who faked a stomachache to get out of running\nthe mile to save herself the embarrassment of always coming in last. She said\nthat at Widjiwagan, everything changed. She tried to do every physical task they\nthrew at the campers, even though her classmates didn’t expect her to do\nanything.\n“On one of the last nights, they took us on a trail through the woods to this cabin\nand taught us about the constellations. Then they said, ‘Now we’re going to\nseparate the boys and the girls and go jump in a hole in the ice.’ I was\ngobsmacked! Apparently we were expected to strip down to our wool socks, sit\nin a scorching-hot sauna and then run out in the snow to a hole in the ice where\ntwo counselors would dunk us in the freezing cold lake.\n“When the counselors asked who wanted to do it, it was crickets. No one wanted\nto try it. I mean, at thirteen years old our first thoughts were probably, ‘NAKED!\nWHAT? ARE YOU CRAZY?’ The room was quiet and I thought, ‘Anjanette, if\nyou don’t do this you will regret it for the rest of your life.’ So ever so slowly I\nlifted my hand in the air and said, ‘I’ll do it.’\n“My friends were shocked. They thought I was joking. But when I stood up and\nfollowed the counselor to the door, they knew I was serious. Now, because I was\nthe girl who sat out every game, every run, every tennis match, they all felt\ncompelled to follow suit. It was an, ‘If Anjanette is doing it, that means we have\nto do it’-sort of thing. So in a way, I was their accountability leader. I held them\naccountable to the experience and they fell in line.”\nAnjanette paused to collect her thoughts. Then she said, “It was amazing, Mike.\nJumping into that hole in the ice, totally naked, not caring what anyone thought\nof my body. And being the first one to do it—that was huge. It set the tone for\nthe rest of my life. I’m a risk-taker now. And it’s partly because I decided to\nlead. As a leader, by default I held myself accountable.”\nTo secure the success of Profit First in your business, to really lock it down and\nensure that your business will be profitable beyond your comprehension, you\nmust hold yourself accountable to the process by whatever means necessary.\nLead a group or join a group. Either way, you will achieve levels of profitability\nyou would never hold yourself accountable for alone.\nAnd look at it this way—at least you don’t have to jump naked into a hole in the\nice on a twenty-below-zero, January Minnesota night. Anjanette would tell you\nthat it’s not so bad, anyway. She’d say, “It’s better than square dancing.”\nACTION STEP\nHOLD YOURSELF ACCOUNTABLE\nThe Only Step: Start looking for a PAG or Profit Pod that will meet your needs,\nor start your own. Begin that process TODAY! For a list of PFPs who lead such\ngroups, or who can help you start one, visit the Resources tab at\nwww.MikeMichalowicz.com. No matter what, don’t go it alone; it’s much easier\nto stay the course when you do it with others.\nCHAPTER NINE: Profit First — Advanced\nTechniques\nWhen folks first join Weight Watchers, they set a goal of losing 10% of their\nbody weight. Even if you weigh 300 pounds and have to lose another 150 to get\ndown to your ideal weight for optimal health, you still only set a goal of losing\n30 pounds. The strategy is to string together a series of small wins and build\nmomentum, plain and simple; and it’s the reason why Weight Watchers has such\nan impressive success ratio compared to other diet programs. With 10% of your\nbody weight kicked to the curb you can focus on the next 10%, and then the next\nuntil you get down to your ideal weight.\nIf on the other hand you focus on the target weight loss goal of 150 pounds from\nthe get-go, you will likely become discouraged and give up; it takes a long time\nto lose an entire person! Massive goals feel exciting when you declare them, but\ncan quickly become de-motivating factors because they seem so hard to reach\nand the chance to celebrate is so far off in the future.\nYou’ll see a lot of formerly overweight and obese people getting into running\nmarathons and triathlons and other extreme endurance races and sports. Do they\nstart this way right out of the gate? Heck, no. They start with a walk around the\nblock. Then a longer walk. Then maybe a walk-run cycle. Then maybe they sign\nup for a 5K.\nSmall wins lead to big wins, and if you started implementing Profit First back in\nChapter 3, you already know that. You lost your 10% and ran your first 5K. Now\nyou’re ready to take on the advanced stuff . Like a dieter who recently\ncompleted a few small goals, your business is healthy enough to take on bigger\nchallenges, now, much healthier than it was before you first cracked this book.\nHere’s the deal: you are about to learn the Profit First equivalent of running your\nfirst marathon. You need to be in shape and all stretched out before you do it. So\nplease do proceed with reading, but don’t implement this stuff until you have\ncompleted at least two full quarters with the core stuff you learned about Profit\nFirst. Are you making your biweekly allocations? Are you amassing some profit,\nno matter how small? Have you experienced a few profit distributions? Are you\nparticipating in some form of PAG? If you answered yes (a real yes) to all four,\nif you’ve mastered not breaking the rules, you’re good to put on your running\nshoes and move forward.\nADVANCED SIMPLIFICATION\nA few years after implementing Profit First for myself, I realized that I could\nreally take my money management to the next level if I tweaked my system\nfurther. The stuff I taught you in the beginning of this book was working well,\nbut there were certain times I still needed to do the accounting work to\nunderstand the financial health of my business. Sometimes my deposits weren’t\nmade as a result of sales; they were simply reimbursements for expenses. Other\ntimes, a client paid a wad of cash up front for work that I would do in dribs and\ndrabs over the next year. Sometimes I needed to make big purchases, and I\nwanted to save for them. Mine wasn’t the only business that needed tweaks;\neveryone I consulted with needed them. So do you. And the process is simple.\nYou need just a few more accounts.\nWhile it may not seem like opening additional accounts simplifies anything, it\nabsolutely does. Whenever you can get a clear, accurate picture of how much\nyou have to spend on a specific aspect of your business, you will make better\ndecisions and be less likely to commit to projects, vendors and expenditures that\ndo not fall in line with the balances in those accounts. Likewise, if you know\nexactly how much cash is flowing into your business at any given time, you can\nmake better decisions about where you need to focus your efforts.\nYou already have your four foundational Profit First accounts open—Profit,\nOperating Expenses, Owner’s Pay and Tax—plus your two no-temptation\naccounts that don’t get touched, the Profit and\nTax Accounts in a separate bank. Here are the additional accounts, contingent on\nyour business needs, that I recommend you consider opening:\nINCOME ACCOUNT\nThis is probably the most helpful and important account for advanced Profit\nFirst. I can’t imagine your business not benefiting from it. In this account, you\ncollect all of your income deposits so that you can clearly see how much cash\nyou collected between your 10th and 25th allocations. This will separate\nincoming from outgoing cash, both of which were being managed by the\nOperating Expenses Account in the simple version of Profit First.\nAn Income Account will give you an accurate picture of how much money you\ncollected during any period of time. And the Operating Expenses Account will\ntransition to only paying the expenses for operations, so you will have an\naccurate picture of how much money is flowing out of your business at any\ngiven time.\nIt’s critical that you adjust to your Real Revenue. If you have material and\nsubcontractor costs, allocate these fixed amounts first, before you do the\npercentage allocations. Then, on the 10th and 25th of every month, allocate all\nremaining money in the Income Account to the other accounts: Profit, Owner’s\nPay, Taxes and Operating Expenses. And possibly a few others suggested below.\nTHE VAULT\nThe Vault is an ultra low-risk, interest-bearing account that you can use for\nshort-term emergencies. At a certain point, leaving 50% in your Profit Account\nto act as a rainy day fund is not prudent since the money flow is a little\nunpredictable. A bad quarter won’t contribute much to the Profit Account. Then\nyou take 50% out for a profit share, and now that Profit Account reserve might\nbe too small for a big business. Every business should have a three-month\nreserve, meaning that, if not a single sale came in, all costs could still be covered\nfor three months (a quarter). The question isn’t if you will have a dark day (your\nsupplier goes out of business, your biggest client goes bankrupt, your best\nemployees leave to start a direct competitor and your clients decide to go with\nthem, etc.). The question is, when will your dark day come? The Vault is there\nfor that.\nWhen you set up The Vault, you must also establish certain rules for its use.\nWhat I mean is that, when you have a situation so dire that you need to access\nthis money, you also have instructions written in advance on how to proceed.\nFor example, if the money is pulled due to a drop in sales, you will pre-plan that,\nbesides just trying to get more sales, you will also cut all the related costs in your\nbusiness within two months if things haven’t improved. Few people have the\ndiscipline to think clearly or act appropriately in times of panic, and that’s why\nwe document a simple set of instructions for ourselves in advance.\nThe idea behind The Vault and the entire Profit First system is that it puts your\ndecisions well out in front of any money crisis. Your business dynamics may\nnot, in fact, improve; but your decision-making will be much farther out in front\nof the actual financial impact. So the goal of The Vault is not to buy time; it may\nafford some time to address unexpected challenges, but it is really about forcing\nimportant decisions early, so your business doesn’t go into a cash crisis (you\nknow, back to the Survival Trap).\nSTOCKING ACCOUNT\nThis is an account for big purchases and to fund stocking parts of your\ninventory. For example, remember my friend JB? His roof decking company,\nRoofDeck Solutions, Ltd., sells the materials contractors need to complete their\nprojects. JB includes some basic nuts and bolts with each order, usually fifty or a\nhundred of each; yet his supplier requires a minimum order of ten thousand at a\ntime, which costs JB roughly $5000. Each order will last JB ten months or\nlonger, so he set up what he calls a “large purchase account” into which he\nallocates 1/20th (that’s $250 each time) of the funds he will need for the next big\nnuts and bolts purchase. Why 1/20th? Because he knows he’ll need the next\norder in ten months, and he is on the 10/25 Rhythm. Ten months, two times a\nmonth, equals twenty allocations before the next big purchase. By doing this, JB\nis able to chip away at the big bill before it happens. Then, when it’s time to\ncough up the $5000 for the next big nuts and bolts order, he’s ready. In the past,\nthis bill caught him off guard and he had to scramble to cover it. Now, he barely\nfeels the $250 he allocates to his Stocking Account twice a month.\nPASS-THROUGH ACCOUNT\nSome businesses receive income from customers that is not to be allocated for\nProfit or Owner’s Pay. Sometimes you may provide a service or a product to\nyour customer at cost (or near cost), and other times you may be reimbursed for\ncosts outright. For example, I travel a lot for my work and in almost every case\nmy clients reimburse my travel costs. That income is not allocated to cover\npayroll or added to my Profit Account. It’s a pass-through and goes directly into\nthis account, and then off to the corresponding vendor to pay the bill. If I have\npaid the bill in advance, the money is deposited into the Pass-Through Account\nand then transferred (on the 10th or 25th) to the Operating Expenses Account,\nfrom which I paid the initial bill. By the way, with all these advanced accounts,\nthe nickname you give each is entirely up to you. I call this one my\nReimbursement Account.\nMATERIALS ACCOUNT\nIf most of your revenue (as indicated in the Instant Assessment) falls into top\nline revenue and does not flow through to Real Revenue, then most of your\nincome is pass-through revenue and the core of your business is basically the\nmanagement of that pass-through. If this is the case, set up a Materials Account\nfor the money that is allocated specifically for purchase of materials. Do not\nallocate it for anything else. (Ever!) If for some reason there is money left over\nat the end of the quarter (in other words, you had a larger profit margin than you\nexpected), you can move that balance to your Income Account (or Operating\nExpenses Account, if you aren’t doing advanced Profit First yet) and make the\nallocations accordingly. The Materials\nAccount functions in the same way the Pass-Through Account does, but it is\nbroken out separately so that you know its exclusive purpose is for materials.\nSUBCONTRACTOR/COMMISSION ACCOUNTS\nIf your business does not purchase materials, but uses contractors or people paid\non commission instead, this is where you allocate the funds to pay these fine\nfolks. Treat it just like the Materials Account, but apply it to contractors and\ncommission-based team members.\nEMPLOYEE PAYROLL ACCOUNT\nEmployee pay is relatively predictable—full-timers are on salary and parttimers, for the most part, work an average number of hours per week. This\nmeans you can look at the cumulative gross pay for your employees plus the\npayroll taxes you’ll incur and allocate funds from your Income Account (if you\nuse advanced Profit First) or Operating Expenses Account (if you use basic\nProfit First) to the Employee Payroll Account every 10th and 25th. If you use a\npayroll service, set them up to pull the payroll from this account (not your\nOperating Expenses Account).\nMAJOR EQUIPMENT ACCOUNT\nSimilar to your Stocking Account, this account is for big purchases you may\nneed to make farther down the road, such as new computers or a high-end 3-D\nprinter. Estimate how much you might have to spend on future equipment\npurchases, divide it by the number of months you have to save up for it, divide\nthat number by two and allocate that amount every 10th and 25th to accumulate\nenough money for that big purchase.\nDRIP ACCOUNT\nThis account is for retainers, advance payments and pre-payments on work your\ncompany will complete over a long period of time and for which you have yet to\nexpend resources. Say you get a big project (congratulations, by the way), and\nyou receive $120,000 from the client\nup front for work you will complete every month over the period of a year. That\nmeans that each month, you will really be earning $10,000. So when you get that\ncheck, put the $120,000 into the Drip Account and then automatically transfer\n$10,000 to the Income Account every month (or better yet, $5,000 every 10th\nand 25th). You don’t touch any of the balance in the Drip Account. You only\nmake allocations when you drip a portion of the funds—in this case, the $10,000\neach month—into the Income Account.\nThe Drip Account will help you manage the true cash flow of earned money, so\nthat you can manage your expenses and costs. For example, the labor doing the\nwork will be paid monthly. I helped implement a Drip Account with my friends\nat TravelQuest International in Prescott, Arizona. They provide their clientele\nwith once-in-a-lifetime trips, from viewing solar eclipses from the best vantage\npoints in the world, to visiting the South Pole to see the Aurora Australis, to\nexperiencing zero gravity in outer space. People book these trips up to five years\nin advance, while the majority of the company’s expenses occur during the year\nof the event. Enter the Drip Account.\nPETTY CASH ACCOUNT\nSet up a bank account and get a debit card for petty cash purchases, such as\nclient lunches. Then, allocate a regular dollar amount from your Operating\nExpenses Account to petty cash. Me? I allocate $100 every two weeks for\nmyself, and also for a few employees who need it. The funds cover gifts, lunches\nand other small purchases. Sorry—if I’m buying, we likely aren’t having an\neight-course meal. . . if it’s not in my Petty Cash Account, it ain’t in my budget.\nSALES TAX ACCOUNT\nIf your business collects sales tax, every single, stinkin’ penny of the sales tax\nyou collect is immediately allocated to this account. For example, if you sell\nsomething for $100 and sales tax is 5%, you will deposit $105 into your Income\nAccount. First, transfer that $5 into your Sales Tax Account; then do your Profit\nFirst allocations with the remaining $100. Sales tax isn’t even legally your\nmoney; you are just acting as a collection agent for the government, so never,\never treat that money as income. Just bang people over the head for the sales tax\nand turn it over to the king (the government).\nFigure 7 is my own account setup. The account numbers are made up, of course,\nand the balances are not my real numbers. But they do show a very typical\nbreakout of the cash, and the names of the accounts are the real names I have\nassigned to my accounts. Next to each name, in parentheses, I put either the\ndollar amount or percentage that goes into each account at the allocation times\n(the 10th and 25th). You should do the same.\nLooking at the numbers, I can see instantly where my business stands. I can run\nan Instant Assessment at any time. For the purposes of this example, I set my\nrequired personal monthly income at $10,000 per month. From there I can\ninstantly calculate the total business income I need to make between every\nallocation period.\nWRITE DOWN THE PROCESS\nCreate a single-page document that defines the function of each account. Explain\nwhat purpose each account serves, and the process you will follow. For example,\ndocument that, on the 10th and 25th of the month, all the money in your Income\nAccount is distributed to the Profit, Owner’s Pay, Tax, and Operating Expenses\nAccounts based on the respective percentages. Then, the specific dollar amounts\n— $75 for Petty Cash and $1500 for Employee Pay—are transferred from the\nOperating Expenses Account into the respective accounts. Finally, the total\nmoney in Bank 1’s Profit and Tax Accounts are transferred to Bank 2.\nThis process is a system, so it needs to be documented. Your bookkeeper might\nhave to take this over for you; otherwise, you might drink too much one night\nand forget the rules you set up for your accounts. Heck, you could end up\nallocating all of your money to your Erik Estrada Fan Club fund, a fan club of\nwhich you are the only member (even Erik dropped out).\nPICK YOUR PAY TO FIND THE NECESSARY BUSINESS INCOME\nThe famed “monthly nut” is a horrible distraction. It’s up there with reruns of\nJersey Shore. The monthly nut is a remnant of the GAAP mentality that simply\ntells us the number we need every month to keep the doors open. And that is\nnonsense. The “monthly nut” is a focus on—you guessed it—expenses, not\nprofit. The concept of the monthly nut makes you focus on expenses and do\neverything you can to earn your “nut” with enough sales. In other words, it has\nus put costs first and makes the goal to cover expenses, not to improve\nprofitability. Can you say “Survival Trap?” Good. I knew you could.\nYou get what you focus on, so stop focusing on expenses. Focus on profit and\nthe expenses will be taken care of by default. Screw the “monthly nut.” Instead,\nfocus on your Required Income For Allocation (RIFA). This is the money you\nneed to deposit by the 10th and again on the 25th to have a healthy business, to\npay the salary you want from your business and to take the profits you deserve.\nPeriod.\nTake your monthly, required personal income and divide it by two, since you are\ngetting paid twice a month. Then divide that number by the percentage being\nallocated in Owner’s Pay. Using the (made up) amounts on Figure 7, I would\ndivide $5000 by 0.31. The result is just over $16,000 in business income, which\nmeans that by the 10th and 25th of every month I need to collect and deposit\naround $16,000 into the Income Account to cover it. It’s really that simple.\nSo when I look at my Income Account (above), I know instantly that I am\ncurrently falling short by $3000 and need to keep the sales moving. Every two\nweeks the Income Account drops to zero when it is allocated, and I need to\nrebuild it to $16,000 or more. Yes, there is a nice chunk of change in my Drip\nAccount; but that money is for services I will render over another twelve\nmonths, so it will only account for about $1000 every allocation period. Using\nthis system, my sales revenue minimum becomes very, very clear.\nWHEN YOU HAVE MORE THAN ONE BUSINESS OWNER\nJust one more point about Owner’s Pay: If you have a partner or multiple\npartners who are also getting paid, you need to add up the total income\nrequirements for the company. So if you need $10,000 a month and your partner\nalso needs $10,000, the total owner pay is $20,000 per month. Divide that\nnumber by two; then divide again, by 0.31, and you get an RIFA of more than\n$32,000.\nYou may also notice that the Profit (15%) Account with Bank 1 is at zero. That\nis because it is simply a holding tray for a day or two. Money gets allocated from\nthe Income Account and goes to the Profit (15%) Account at Bank 1. Then, on\nthe same day, I initiate a transfer to Bank 2, to pull the entire amount of money\nout of the Profit (15%) Account at Bank 1 and put it into the Profit Account at\nBank 2. That is where the profit accumulates. And I can see, it looks as though I\nwill have a really nice, $7000-plus profit celebration at the end of this quarter.\nIt’s a simple calculation: $14,812.11 x 50%. Par-tay!\nThis same holding tray setup is in place for my Tax (15%) Account. Allocate\nand then remove the temptation immediately.\nAlso, you may notice that no bank summary “grand total” is shown in the table.\nThe accounts aren’t all automatically added up to show a total combined\nbalance. Many banks do this for your convenience, but I suggest that you disable\nthe option (if you can). The grand total of all your accounts shows you all the\nmoney on one big plate again— exactly the thing we want to avoid. Looking at a\ngrand total messes with your mind, so don’t do it.\nTHE PARETO OVERLAP\nYou may be familiar with the Pareto Principle, commonly known as the “80/20\nrule.” For the history buffs: Vilfredo Federico Damasa Pareto was an Italian\neconomist. While studying the distribution of wealth in Italy in the late 1800s, he\ndiscovered that 20% of the Italian population owned 80% of the land. Then he\nlooked at his garden, and observed that 20% of the peapods contained 80% of\nthe peas. Then he looked down at his feet, and exclaimed, “OMG—I own five\npairs of clogs, yet I wear these super-fly boots 80% of the time!” And then, out\nof nowhere the theme song from The Twilight Zone started playing, thus\nmarking the first time that music was associated with a slightly unsettling a-ha\nmoment.\nOkay, okay. I made up that last part, but you get my drift. Pareto’s pattern is\neverywhere. Eighty percent of the time you drive, you’re cruising down the same\n20% of the roads you’ll travel in life. And, despite your love of the sale rack,\nyou will still pull from the same 20% of the clothes hanging in your closet, 80%\nof the time. Chances are, you are wearing one of your fave pairs of pants or\nshoes right now, as you read this. You are, aren’t you? That’s Pareto’s rule at\nplay in your own life. Cue Rod Serling and a smoldering Chesterfield cigarette.\nPareto’s Principle also applies to your clients, in that 20% of them yield 80% of\nyour revenue. This is a foundational principle of the growth strategy I detailed in\nmy book, The Pumpkin Plan. And it goes further—80% of your profit is derived\nfrom 20% of the products and/ or services you offer.\nThe key to this advanced strategy is to connect the two—your clients and your\noffering. Some of your top clients buy most of your profitable offerings; some of\nyour top clients go for the offering with the lowest profit margin. Likewise,\nsome of your weakest clients consistently purchase your profitable stuff and\nsome are just weak all the way around, buying the same no-profit stuff over and\nover again.\nOnce you see the overlap, the decisions become very easy. Get rid of the “bad”\nclients who only want your least profitable products and services. You are losing\nmoney here, catering to clients or customers who are not a good fit for your\ncompany.\nFind a new way to manage the weak clients who do buy your most profitable\nofferings. Often, “bad” clients can become better clients if you meet with them\nto set new expectations and methods of communication. Meet with your top\nclients who don’t buy profitable offerings, too. Find out how you can deliver\nprofitable stuff to them.\nWhen you focus on profit first, even when choosing the clients and customers\nyou are willing to work with, you increase your profit dramatically. Not only do\nyou save money by cutting expenses related to serving weak clients, who don’t\nbuy profitable offerings; you also free up your time, energy and creativity to\nfocus on the clients you love, who bring in the profit. Applied to your client\nbase, the Pareto Principle is an advanced Profit First technique that does double\nduty— you save money and gain profit. Gotta love that!\nAnd those beloved top clients, who routinely buy profitable offerings? You are\ngoing to rock their world. Get to know them better than they know themselves.\nThese are the clients and customers you want to clone. Remember, profit is in\nproductivity. Systematize the overlap of your best clients buying your most\nprofitable offerings and watch your Profit Account grow by leaps and bounds.\nEMPLOYEE FORMULA\nThere is a really simple formula for determining if you can afford a new hire—or\nif your business is currently understaffed or overstaffed. For each full-time\nemployee, your company should generate Real Revenue of $150,000 to\n$250,000 (ideally more, but this is the minimum). So, if you want a milliondollar company, you know that you can afford four to six employees (including\nyourself). This is just a ballpark number; every business is unique. But do not\nuse your super distinctive status as an excuse to hire more people.\nEfficiency is always the goal. Always. Not hiring your husband’s cousin who is\ndown on his luck and “could really use a job.” Not finding space for the brilliant\nkid who has a ton of great ideas you could use… someday. You’re a “bottom\nline” person now, remember? You flipped the formula. Now, you’re working the\n“Sales – Profit = Expenses” system. You’re taking profit first. And that’s why\nyou’re forced to be careful with your expenses.\nAnd remember—we’re talking about Real Revenue, not top line revenue.\nSubtract your Material and Subs cost before you divide by the magic number\nrange to get to your ideal employee count.\nAgain, this is not an exact, perfect system, but it will give you a better and more\nrealistic understanding of what it means to be over-or understaffed. The reason\nthese numbers aren’t perfect is because labor costs vary tremendously. A guy\ncooking French fries at McDonalds will make much less than the lady who\nengineered the next generation smartphone. In this example, cheap labor is less\ncostly but also has a smaller impact on revenue. The fry guy just facilitates that\nsale of fries, and the engineer creates an entirely new product and revenue\nstream.\nRemember Greg Crabtree, the author of Simple Numbers, Straight Talk, Big\nProfits whom I met an entrepreneurial award event? I had a call with him one\nevening. After he poked fun at Virginia Tech (my alma mater) losing to\nAlabama (his alma mater) yet again, he shared another instant labor analysis he\nagreed to let me pass on to you.\nAccording to Greg, your Real Revenue must be two-and-a-half times the total\nlabor cost if you’re running a tech business. This is because the tech industry\ntraditionally requires expensive labor (highly-trained people who have a big\nimpact on revenue). If, on the other hand, you are in a “cheap labor” field, such\nas the fast food restaurant example I used above, your Real Revenue must be\nfour times your total labor cost.\nFor example, let’s say you’re a manufacturer with $6,000,000 in Real Revenue.\nIf you hire “cheap labor” (like assembly line personnel), you will divide\n$6,000,000 by four to get $1,500,000. This means that your total labor cost (the\npeople on the floor and the folks in the office) should not exceed $1,500,000.\nAnd if you are a manufacturer with $6,000,000 in Real Revenue but use\n“expensive labor” (like scientists and engineers), divide the $ 6,000,000 in Real\nRevenue by two-and-a-half to get a total labor cost of $2,400,000.\nMINI POWER TACTICS\nSome advanced Profit First strategies require very little time and are super\neffective. I am constantly tweaking and improving my system, so if you want to\nknow about my latest discoveries, and share yours, visit my blog at Mike\nMichalowicz.com. Here are my favorites (so far):\nTHE GOVERNMENT’S MONEY\nIt’s so easy to “borrow” from our Tax Account. (It’s really stealing, but you\ndon’t need me to tell you that… oops. I just did.) The money is just sitting there,\ntaunting us with all of those zeros we could put to good use. When we cave and\npull from the Tax Account, we don’t feel the pain right away. But when tax time\ncomes, we can get in really big trouble. Owing more taxes than we have money\nto pay means that, at a minimum, we’ll be paying interest and possibly penalties\non the amount we owe.\nA smart tactic is first to move this account to a third-party bank that you don’t\nsee, and then change the name of the Tax Account to\n“The Government’s Money.” Now, I suspect that, like me, you would be way\nmore reluctant to “steal money from the government” than you would be to\n“borrow money from the Tax Account.”\nHIDE ACCOUNTS\nFollowing the “out of sight, out of mind” theory, you are less likely to justify\ntransferring or withdrawing funds from your accounts if you can’t see them.\nSome banks allow you to “hide” accounts so that you can’t see them on first\nview when logging in to online banking. Try hiding all of your accounts except\nfor the Operating Expenses Account. You can still do the disbursements and the\nentire Profit First system using this tactic; it just means that now you won’t\nconsider the other accounts when making spending decisions.\nOUTSIDE INCOME ACCOUNTS\nChances are that as your business matures, you will add a variety of other\naccounts that collect income. You may have a PayPal account to collect funds,\nor a wire account for international business or local transfers. The challenge with\nthese accounts is, you might start to view them as “extra,” like your own\nadditional petty cash fund. They’re not extra. They are part of your revenue, and\nyou need to make sure that you protect and allocate the funds just as you would\nany deposit into your main bank account.\nFor this tactic, set up all your outside income accounts so that any income is\ntransferred to your main Income Account on a daily basis. Some banks will let\nyou set up an auto-transfer for the total balance in the outside account, which is\nideal as long as you keep whatever minimum balance is required to avoid\nextraneous administration fees.\nIf you can’t do this automatically, simply transfer the money to your Income\nAccount when you do your biweekly allocations. Just note that these transfers\nmay take a few days, so you won’t instantly have the money in the Income\nAccount and will have to wait until your next allocation period to move the\nmoney to all the individual accounts.\nACCOUNT SNAPSHOT\nTo keep track of your accounts, set up auto-notifications for your key accounts\nvia email or text. Have the bank report the balances of your Income Account and\nOperating Expenses Account to you on the 10th (when all of your money has\naccumulated) and the 15th (when all of your money has been allocated and all\nchecks have been mailed; and again on the 24th (accumulated) and the 30th\n(allocated). Set up a daily notification of the balance in your Petty Cash\nAccount. Check the other accounts manually.\nThis quick report will ensure that you are acutely aware of how cash flows in\n(Income Account) and what is available to go out of your business (Operating\nExpenses Account) and out of your own spending allotment (Petty Cash).\nBANK CHECKS\nUntil we see that a payment has cleared, we still think of the money is ours. And\nsometimes we forget we wrote the check. Hello, insufficient funds charges and a\nticket straight to the ninth circle of hell. This technique changes that dynamic\nimmediately. Rather than pay with checks you write by hand and mail (if you\ndon’t lose the envelope on the floor of your car), pay with bank checks.\nAlso called “bank pay” or “bank payment processing,” bank checks are\nprocessed by your bank quickly. More importantly, the bank will pull the money\nfor the checks you “write” immediately. This way, you know the money is gone\nforever as soon as you process a payment.\nYes, the bank makes money on “the float,” and you lose any interest you may\nhave earned in the few days it would take your payment to be received and\nprocessed by vendors. But I say, “Who cares?” Here’s the dealio: If you manage\nhundreds of millions or billions by processing checks and transfers manually, it’s\na good strategy to cling to your money for a few days because the interest earned\non your operating capital in even just a few days is significant. But for most\nentrepreneurs, the interest earned in “the float” is embarrassingly negligible—\nusually around $5 per year, and you’ll spend more than that on postage, mailing\nout your payments! So let the bank do the dirty work, why don’t ya?\nACTION STEP\nPLAN TO ADVANCE\nChoose one of the advanced tactics or strategies detailed in this chapter and add\nit to your to-do list for six months from now. It may seem silly to add a to-do\nitem so far out, but if you don’t put it on your radar, you may end up forgetting\nthat there are advanced strategies that could help you take Profit First—and your\ncompany—to the next level.\nCHAPTER TEN: Living Profit First\nI’m going to Disneyland!\nIt’s the iconic moment—a sports team wins the championship game and the field\nreporter rushes over to the star player to ask the same old question: “Hey, giant\nfootball guy, you just won the Super Bowl. What are you going to do now?” The\nplayer smiles, showing a big gap in his teeth, stares right into the camera and\nshouts, “I’m going to Disneyland, mother@#$%&!” The station beeps out the\n@#$%&! part. Barely.\nI thought about this phenomenon during a recent conversation with Laurie Udy,\naccountant and owner of Secretly Spoiled, a company that recently started using\nProfit First. She shared with me that she took her family on their first Disney\nvacation using her quarterly profit disbursement. A type-A numbers person,\nLaurie had been investing everything she had in her business—most of her time\nand all of her revenue.\n“I was living check-to-check,” Laurie told me. “I wasn’t taking a salary.”\nAll of that changed as soon as Laurie started plugging Profit First into her wellorganized system. Within months, her personal finances stabilized; and by the\ntime her first quarterly disbursement came around, she had enough to take her\nfamily on their first trip to Disneyland.\n“The trip was amazing, and we’re already planning the next one,” Laurie said.\n“But what really surprised me was, after funneling all of my money into my\nbusiness thinking that it was the only way to make it grow, my business actually\nstarted to grow faster when I started paying myself and focusing on the profit\nfirst!”\nLike so many of us used to “doing anything” to build our businesses (including\ngoing without pay and delaying profit indefinitely), Laurie had to learn how to\ngive herself permission to use her hard-earned money not only to pay herself, but\nalso to enjoy herself—to provide experiences for her family that would enhance\ntheir quality of life and create a lifetime of treasured memories. The business\nwas no longer a cash-eating monster. Not even close. It said, “Bon Voyage!” to\nLaurie and her family as they cruised off to Disneyland, mother@#$%&!\nThis won’t come as a shock to you: Everything you just learned about creating a\nProfit First business also applies to your personal life. I mean, if you think about\nit, running your life is like running a business. You generate income and spend\nmoney. Your income likely varies at times. You never know when a crisis might\nhit and make a huge dent in your bank account. And you have a vision for your\nlife, just as you have a vision for your business—one that, before reading this\nbook, you may have thought hinged on a lucky lottery ticket or some other\nsudden windfall.\nNow you know better. You know that in order to save enough money for a rainy\nday and the celebratory pleasures of life, you need to pull that money out before\nyou spend a dime on other things. You know that a smaller plate will help you\ntrim the fat from your lifestyle and zero in on what’s most important to you and\nfind fun, creative solutions to get what you want. And you know that the big\nvision you have for your life does not have to hinge on luck or fate—it can be\nearned, not with a dollar for the Powerball, but with a simple change in habit,\npracticed consistently.\nYou know what? That’s a big, big deal. And I want to acknowledge it. I want\nyou to acknowledge it. This small change you made, putting profit first, is the\nentrepreneurial equivalent of winning the World Series, the Super Bowl and\nStanley Cup. You created the miracle that is your business and now, by\nimplementing the Profit First system, you have ensured its greatness—not just in\nterms of profitability, but also in terms of the positive impact your business will\nhave on the world.\nSo guess what? It’s time to get your gappy, toothy smile on. You’re going to\nDisneyland! Let’s apply your championship-winning strategy to the rest of your\nlife, okay?\nTHE PROFIT FIRST LIFESTYLE\nThe ultimate goal of the Profit First Lifestyle is financial freedom, which I\ndefine as doing what you choose to do whenever you choose to do it. Financial\nfreedom means that you have reached a point where the money you’ve saved\nyields enough interest to support your lifestyle and continues to grow. The path\nto financial freedom is paved with simple, small habit changes that become\nsystematized and apply to both your business and personal finances.\nNow, I did not write this book to teach you about your family budget or your\n401K, but I do know this: If you own a business, your personal financial health\nis in lockstep with the financial health of your business. In fact, the analogy of\nyour business being your child is only partially accurate. A better analogy is that\nyour business is your Siamese twin. Separating yourself from it must be done\nwith absolute surgical precision, and even if the operation is successful you will\nalways share a soul.\nSo, soulmate, you need to apply everything you’re doing right now (and\nplanning to do) to fix your business with Profit First to your life, too. I wrote this\nchapter to serve as a take-action-now primer on living a Profit First life. I\nsuggest you also read David Ramsey’s The Total Money Makeover. If there is a\nBible for getting your personal finances lined up the right way, I believe his\nbook is it. And who knows, maybe down the road I will write my own “New\nTestament.”\nThat said, here is the core stuff you need to know about setting yourself up to\nlive a Profit First life:\n1. Face the music. This step should be easier now that you’ve faced the\ntruth about your company’s finances. Add up all of your monthly bills,\nplus your annual bills and the debt you owe.\n2. If you have any debt at all, stop accruing more. Put a freeze on all\npurchases you cannot pay for with cash.\n3. Establish a personal Profit First habit. Set up an automatic\nwithdrawal so that every time you get paid, which should now be\ntwice a month on the 10th and 25th, a percentage immediately\ntransfers into a retirement savings account. If you are carrying any\namount of debt, keep the retirement percentage at 1% until the debt is\npaid off. Use every penny you have after necessary expenses to\neradicate your debt.\n4. Set up your “small plates.” Create four core accounts and multiple\nDay-to-Day accounts.\na. Income Account. This is the account into which you make deposits.\nFrom this account, allocate money to the other accounts.\nb. The Vault Account. Initially, this is the “oh shit” account, the\namount of savings you must have on hand to get through the month if\n—scratch that— when something dire happens. Now, Suze Orman\nrecommends saving eight months’ worth of living expenses, but that’s\nnot doable for basically any human being on this planet, right off the\nbat. However, you will work toward it slowly and methodically—you\nknow, Profit First style.\nA good starting balance for The Vault is one month’s rent or mortgage\npayment. If you can spare that right now, transfer it to The Vault\nimmediately. Remember, this account must be difficult to access (e.g.,\ndifferent bank, no online banking, no checkbook, etc.). Once you\neradicate debt, The Vault will grow and grow, with the intention of\nhaving the cash you save here eventually become a source of income.\nThis is where money makes you even more money.\nc. Recurring Payments Account. This account is for payment of your\nrecurring bills, including fixed (e.g., your mortgage or car loan),\nvarying (e.g., utility bills) and short-term (e.g., an installment plan for\nyour kid’s braces).\nDetermine the monthly average for your varying recurring bills, plus\n10%. Then total your fixed recurring bills. Add the two totals together\nplus the cost of your short-term recurring bills: This is the amount you\nwill transfer from your Income Account into your Recurring Payments\nAccount every month. If you have it, transfer that amount now.\nd. Day-to-Day Account (multiple, if needed). There are many day-today costs in keeping a family running—groceries, clothes, school\nsupplies, Girl Scout cookies, date night, running shoes, Girl Scout\ncookies, baby-sitting, toiletries, snow tires, Girl Scout cookies. . .\nsorry. If there is anything that can take me joyfully down the sugar\nhigh path, it’s the ultimate in sweet delights: Girl Scout Samoas\ncookies.\nSet up a Day-to-Day Account for anyone in the house who’s\nresponsible for paying for these types of expenses, and transfer the\namount that each person needs every 10th and 25th from the Income\nAccount, based on spending requirements. For example, my wife and I\nboth buy stuff for the house—I’m the Costco king, she handles the\ngrocery stores. And we both gas up cars and pay for kid expenses. Get\na debit card for each person so that purchases are deducted from the\naccount immediately.\ne. Debt Destroyer Account. This account receives all remaining funds\nand goes toward eradicating debt. Following Dave Ramsey’s advice,\nmake the minimum payment on each debt. Then, regardless of interest\nrates (unless they are extreme), pay off your smallest debt first. Wipe\nthat sucker out and then move on to the next one. Ramsey wisely says\nthat paying off a debt, however small, creates a mental momentum that\nwill motivate you to pay off the rest of your debt, faster. Remember,\nwe are emotional beasts, not logical ones.\nIf you are carrying debt, I want you to cut up your credit cards. Remember, it’s\nmuch easier to go with human behavior than it is to fight it, so removing\ntemptation is the best solution.\nHowever, I do have one exception. An entrepreneur’s income can be highly\nunpredictable. You could have an amazing month followed by a zero-dollar\nmonth, followed by a not-bad month, followed by a why-do-I-bother month. If\nyou follow Profit First, your Owner’s Pay Account should address this and your\nincome should become consistent. But in the beginning, it probably won’t be.\nAnd if you’re a start-up, you may not get any cash at first. For these reasons, I\nbelieve in keeping one credit card line to buffer you in dark months. Put the\ncredit card in a sealed envelope labeled “emergency only” and give it to a trusted\nfriend to hold onto. I am serious. You must remove temptation. Here’s how you\nmanage your emergency credit card the Profit First way:\nEvery quarter, as you make progress paying down debt, reduce your credit limit\nby 50% of the amount you paid down. Say you have a maxed-out card with a\n$10,000 limit. By the end of the quarter, you’ve managed to pay down $3000 of\nthat debt (nicely done, my friend). Now you have $7000 in debt and a $10,000\nlimit. What I want you to do is call the credit card company and ask them to\nreduce your limit by $1500, which is 50% of the amount you paid down in the\nfirst quarter. Now your debt is $7000 and your credit limit is $8500. In doing\nthis, you put up a guard rail of sorts, a mechanism to protect yourself and keep\nyour debt total down (should you convince yourself it’s okay to max out your\ncredit card again), while keeping a credit line buffer in place should you need the\ncard for emergency funds during slow months.\nKeep following this method every quarter until your credit card balance is zero\nand your credit limit is $5000. Put that credit card in a sealed envelope and store\nit in a safe place (your wallet, it goes without saying, is not safe). Better yet,\nhave a reliable friend hold onto it for you. This is your emergency line.\nNow, for those of you who say, “But Mike, if I drop my credit line, my debt-to-\ncredit-limit ratios will fall out of favor with lenders and my interest rates will go\nup!”\nTo that I say, “Who cares?”\nThe goal here is to remove financial stress from your life by eradicating debt, not\nto get better rates on more debt. We can worry about improving your credit score\nonce you are debt free. Remember my buddy Phil Tirone? That’s what he does\nnow. Once he figured out the formula for becoming debt free, he started\n720CreditScore.com, his business that repairs credit scores. Follow suit... first,\ndestroy your debt. Then, fix your score.\nRIP OFF THE BAND-AID\nThe day my daughter handed over her piggy bank in an effort to help solve my\nself-made financial crisis, I still had all three of my luxury cars parked in the\ndriveway. I was still a member of the country club I never went to and had a ton\nof recurring expenses that, quite frankly and even more embarrassingly, I could\nnot name.\nIn the weeks and months leading up to that moment, I knew I was running out of\ntime, but still held onto the trappings of the lifestyle I had earned (but not\n“learned”), the lifestyle I thought I deserved and did not want to give up. But my\ndaughter’s amazing act of selflessness woke me up to the reality that none of that\nstuff mattered.\nIt’s common for us emotional humans to give up the stuff we can no longer\nafford (or couldn’t afford in the first place) by small degrees. We cling. We keep\nhoping that something will “turn up” and “save the day,” and so we dole out the\npain in small increments, biding our time. We do this because we hate loss.\nMore specifically, we have a far greater desire to avoid losing something than\nwe have to acquiring something. This behavioral response is called Loss\nAversion, and it is mighty powerful. Combine it with the Endowment Effect—\nthe theory that states that we place a much higher significance on something we\npossess than on an identical thing that we don’t possess—and you are dealing\nwith a stubbornness resembling that of a three-year-old in a tug-of-war for a\nbeloved blankie. (“Mine!”)\nFor example, the beautiful red Porsche you’ve been eyeing—it would be nice to\nhave, for sure. But once you have it, it’s way past “nice.” Now, it’s badass (and\nso are you). You polish the car. You take friends for rides in it. You take selfies\nwith that red beauty in the background of each photo (just by chance, of course).\nYou love it because now that you own it, your relationship to it has changed,\neven though it’s the same car you once idly admired from the showroom floor.\nThen you get the notice: You missed yet another payment. If you miss one more\nthey will repossess your baby. Your baby. So what do you do? Return the car?\nNo, you cancel your daughter’s ballet class (she kinda sucked anyway), and your\ngym membership (you kinda sucked anyway), and that trip to the Cape (because\neveryone knows, anyone who goes to the Cape sucks… a lot). You eat ramen\nnoodles every night. Shoot, you even cancel the insurance on the damn car and\nkeep it parked safely in your garage until “better days” come along. So what if\nyou can’t drive it? At least you didn’t lose it. At least it’s still yours.\nI behaved the same way. I cut back everywhere I could, but nowhere that I\nshould have. Then, when I couldn’t pay a bill and the credit cards were maxed, I\ncut just enough things to get by. The next month it happened all over again, only\nworse. Juggling bills and drumming up money were a source of constant stress.\nThe night after my “piggy bank moment,” I remembered what I used to do in the\npast, when money was tightest in the early days of starting up a new business: I\nwouldn’t cut expenses in ineffective dribs and drabs. I would cut them all.\nIt was time for me to return to what worked. It was time to rip off the Band-Aid.\nI cut everything. The luxury cars? Gone. (I replaced the three cars with two used,\nbasic models.) The swanky club membership? Gone. The little extravagances,\nlike the Netflix account? Gone. And here is what made it easier—I realized that\nno one gives a crap. I mean truly, no one cares. I’m guessing you had no idea I\nwas slashing and burning when I was in the throes, never thought for one\nsecond, “Hey, I wonder how good ol’ Mikey is making out with his financials?”\nAnd I’ll bet you aren’t crying about me right now, either. And that’s cool,\nbecause that’s reality.\nWhen you realize that 99.99% of the people who know you or know of you\nwon’t care what you own or where you hang out or what your circumstances are,\nand that the 0.01% who, for whatever reason, can’t stand you will simply point a\nfinger at you, laugh evilly and then direct their self-loathing misery at someone\nelse, it’s easier to ditch the pimped-out ride.\nAnd when you realize that 99.99% of the people who do know you and truly\nlove you will rally around your courage, as my family did for me, that, that is\nwhen you will stand up, brush yourself off and say, “Let’s do it.”\nDEATH TO DEBT\nNow, your business will be sending you a quarterly profit disbursement check.\nYippee! Celebration time! And do you know the best way to celebrate when you\nhave mongo personal debt? Have a death-to- debt party. It’s super fun and goes\nsomething like this: As soon as you get your disbursement check, turn on some\ntunage that gets you fired up—my choice would be Metallica’s “Seek And\nDestroy,” but if you don’t have a mullet, do your thing. For God’s sake, though,\ndon’t crank up the Barry Manilow or “Escape (The Piña Colada Song)” by\nRupert Holmes… we want to destroy debt, here, not make love to it.\nThen, make sure you have a glass of libation, or whatever floats your boat.\nFinally, take 90% of your profit disbursement and use it to pay down debt\n(smallest first). Call it in using your debit card, or go online and get it done\nimmediately. Then, and only then, raise your glass and say, “Cheers to me!”\nThen, we dance (or swing our sweaty, stringy mullet hair around while listening\nto Metallica). The party is over in about ten minutes, but that debt? It’s gone\nforever. Hey, wasn’t that a total blast?\nYou may think I’m being sarcastic here, but I’m not. To me, paying down debt is\nwinning, and winning is fun. Get yourself some of those crackers the Brits give\nout at Christmas—you know, the little cardboard tubes covered in wrapping\npaper that two people pull apart like a wishbone to reveal little trinkets and\nrevelry inside?—for your party. Invite your spouse. Whatever it takes to\ncommemorate the occasion. (And if you videotape your tiny death-to-debt party,\nsend me a link, okay? I want to post the best of the best on my blog.\nUse the remaining 10% of your profit disbursement however you please. Go out\nto dinner. If you don’t have enough for dinner, go out for ice cream. No matter\nwhat your disbursement is, cherish it. Celebrate with it. Your business is still\nserving you and killing debt at the same time.\nAfter you’ve eradicated your core debt—credit cards, bank loans and student\nloans—start using 45% of your quarterly profit disbursement to kill remaining\nlong-term debt and keep 55% for your splurge item or experience. This is\nanother psychological move. It’s more gratifying to get the bigger chunk of the\nfruits of your labor and spend it on whatever the hell you want than to take the\nsmaller chunk. So use 45% to expedite the payoff of long-term debt beyond your\nnormal monthly payments (mortgage, car payments) and keep the rest for\nwhatever crazy antics you get up to. (What? I don’t judge. And I totally didn’t\nsee anything.)\nAfter you own your cars and home outright and have wiped out debt from every\nnook and cranny of your life, one hundred percent of the profit disbursement\ngoes to you. And this time the party had better be legit. I’m talking a band and\nsome good booze, maybe stuffed pizza instead of plain. And my wife and I had\nbetter get an invite.\nLOCK IN YOUR LIFESTYLE\nRemember the graphic in Chapter 2 that showed how our expenses increase at a\nparallel to our income? That is the concept of Parkinson’s Law (nothing to do\nwith Parkinson’s disease), in which C. Northcote Parkinson explained how our\navailable resources (time, money) expand to fill the space made available for\nthem. This is why, if you give yourself two weeks to complete a project, you will\nget it done in two weeks; but if you give yourself eight weeks to finish the same\nproject, it will take eight weeks. This is also why, if you have ten dollars in your\npocket, you will spend ten dollars. As our income increases, Parkinson’s Law\ntakes over and we spend every extra penny we earn.\nNow that you know your salary and actually take it, you need to live within your\nmeans. Then, you’re going to lock in your lifestyle. What that means is, no\nmatter how good things get (and this is going to be a challenge for you, because\nnow that you follow Profit First things will get amazing), you will not expand\nyour lifestyle in response. You need to accumulate cash—lots of it—and that\nmeans no new cars, no brand-new furniture or crazy vacations. For the next five\nyears, you will lock it in and live the lifestyle you are designing now so that all\nof your extra profit goes toward giving you that ultimate reward: financial\nfreedom.\nDon’t freak out on me, now. I’m not telling you that you shouldn’t go out to\ndinner with your sweetie or go away for the weekend. (Were you thinking a\nB&B? I like B&Bs.) You need to enjoy life. I get it. What I am telling you is, in\norder for Profit First to have a permanent impact on your life, you need to build\nas big a gap as possible between what you earn and what you spend. The more\ncash you can collect the better, because at a certain point money starts earning\nyou substantial money, all by itself. Money yields interest and returns from\ninvestments. And remember, once the money you have collected yields more\nnew money every year than you spend in a year, you have achieved financial\nfreedom.\nHere are five rules to help you stay locked in to your lifestyle for the next five\nyears:\n1. Always start by looking for a free option.\n2. Never buy new when you can get the same benefit you would if you\nbought used. (It’s used as soon as you buy it, anyway.)\n3. Never pay full price if you can avoid it.\n4. Negotiate and seek alternatives first.\n5. Delay major purchases until you have written down ten alternatives\nto making the purchase and have thought each one through. Save your\nsplurging for Profit First quarterly disbursements! Yay!\nThe Profit First Lifestyle is a frugal lifestyle, for sure. But the frugal lifestyle is\nnot the same as a cheap lifestyle. You can and will live very well (actually\nbetter) when you are frugal than you would when you are posing as a big\nspender. Why? Because frugality removes financial stress, enabling you to better\nappreciate and enjoy the things and experiences you purchase. Big spenders buy\nthe same things, but their purchases are served with a big ol’ heaping serving of\nmassive stress. Who’s got time for that? Remember, well-dressed poverty is still\npoverty.\nIf staring down the next five years is too much for you, that’s cool. I have a Plan\nB for you. (And if you do rock the five years, this is your next step after your\nlocked-in lifestyle term is up). It’s called the Wedge Theory, a term that has been\nfloating around entrepreneurial circles for a while, which as far as I can tell was\noriginally coined by Brian Tracey. The idea of the Wedge Theory is to only\ngradually (and mindfully) upgrade your lifestyle as your income increases.\nEvery time your income increases, you set aside half of the increase in savings\nso that you don’t expand your lifestyle to, as Parkinson’s Law suggests, “use all\navailable resources.”\nSo for example, if you’re taking home $100,000 (post-tax, paid by your\nbusiness) and your Profit First Lifestyle means you’re setting aside $20,000\nevery year and living on $80,000; this is where you will start your wedge. Half\nof every income bump over and above $100,000 will go directly into The Vault.\nThe Vault starts piling up cash, and changes from a “Holy crap, I have no\nmoney” fund to a “Holy cow, that’s a lot of money” fund.\nLet’s say your take-home income goes up to $135,000, an increase of $35,000\nover the previous year. You would take 50% of the $35,000 ($17,500) and drop\nit into The Vault. This leaves just over $117,000. Because you live the Profit\nFirst Lifestyle, you now take 20% and set it aside for savings. With the increase\nin income, that number is now $23,400. That brings your annual savings up to\nright around $50,000. And, you are now living on more as well—$93,600, to be\nexact, an increase of more than $13,000. Your life moves forward, but the\nWedge Theory, combined with Profit First, allows your savings to climb super\nfast, getting you that much closer to financial freedom.\nPROFIT FIRST KIDS\nWhen was the last time you got a chunk of free money? The answer is never.\nAnd even if you were granted money (thanks to old great-gramma Sally), there\nis always a tradeoff. Regardless of how you get your money, the universe seems\nto find a way to make us earn it. This is why I don’t gift my kids an allowance.\nInstead, I set up a chore list with corresponding pay rates and post it on the\nrefrigerator. (You can download one from the Resources section at\nMikeMichalowicz.com.) The kids decide how much they earn, by working for it.\nGive your kids some mailing envelopes (you know, the snail mail type) and have\nthem label each one:\n1. One for the big dream, like my daughter’s horse. Have them stash\nup to 25% of their chore money in this envelope.\n2. One to help support the family. This number should be a recurring\nnumber, such as $5 a week to contribute to groceries or entertainment.\nThe key is to have a recurring fee so they get used to having to pay out\nsomething on a regular basis. Make sure the number is ageappropriate.\n3. One for impact. Have them put 5 to 10% into this envelope to give\nto a charity of their choice, or to use in a meaningful way… like\nstarting their own business, one that both serves the community and\nmakes money!\n4. One for The Vault. This is where they will sock away 10% of their\nfunds for a critical emergency (hopefully your kids will never have\none, but you want them prepared from day one), which will also\nbecome an investing source as the money accumulates.\n5. One envelope for mad money, to buy whatever they need or want—\ntoys, music, books, etc. Let them earn money and have fun!\nI mentioned my barber Lou in the Introduction. He is the master of the envelope\nsystem. He divides every day’s take among envelopes appropriate for his\nbusiness. His shop has been profitable every single month for decades and he has\nno debt (except he owes me a haircut for mentioning him in this book).\nIt goes without saying that the kids must follow the Profit First golden rule:\nAlways allocate the money to the different accounts (envelopes) before doing\nanything else.\nThis system will teach your kids so much about the value of money—how to\nmanage it, how to earn it, how to finance their dreams. It may feel strange at first\n(I’m talking to you, helicopter parents), and you’ll surely get some pushback; but\nthis is a massive gift to them. Imagine how your financial life might have turned\nout differently, had someone taught you these important lessons and strategies?\nOr, if you are lucky enough that your parents did, just think about how well it\nserved you and do the same for your kids.\nGiving your kid a car may feel nice to you, but it’s selfish as hell. You are only\navoiding “disappointing” your children when you indulge them and make their\nlives easier, and this only hurts them when they enter the “real world”\ncompletely unprepared for reality. Let your children get burned a little within the\nsafety of your parenting, rather than scorched in the unsafe and often cruel\nworld.\n• • •\nOne of my favorite Profit First Lifestyle nights was when my wife and I and two\nof our friends went into New York City to see Jimmy Fallon at his former show,\nLate Night with Jimmy Fallon. The tickets were in a lottery and we happened to\nget them. We saw the show live, and laughed and laughed. Meatloaf opened the\nshow and Twisted Sister ended it with a rocking three-song mini-concert. Seeing\nJimmy Fallon cost a whopping zero dollars. Watching Dee Schneider bang out\n“I Wanna Rock” cost zero dollars. In the words of the famous commercial: “An\namazing night out with my wife and friends? Priceless.”\nHere’s the deal—living the Profit First life does not have to be excruciatingly\npainful. I’m not suggesting that you sell everything and live in a hut, work by\ncandlelight and eat whatever you can find on the forest floor. I’m not even\nsuggesting that you give up the things you love. I’m simply suggesting that if\nyou want true financial freedom, you will have to let go of your preconceived\nnotions about what you “need” and start placing a higher value on financial\nindependence than you do on your stuff. It’s not rocket science. And it won’t kill\nyou. Promise.\nACTION STEPS\nLIVE PROFIT FIRST\nStep One: Set up corresponding Profit First allocation accounts for your\npersonal expenses.\nStep Two: Based on your most recent pay and the “lifestyle lock” explained in\nthis chapter, figure out how much you should truly be living on.\nStep Three: Have a sit-down with your entire family and talk numbers. Tell\nthem what you’re doing with Profit First and the positive impact it will have on\nyour family’s long-term financial health. And if it helps, you can tell the kids\nthat this method was something suggested by “Uncle Mikey.”\nCHAPTER ELEVEN: Where It All Falls Apart\nIn the spring of 1954, the notion of any athlete running a mile in less than four\nminutes was considered impossible. Four minutes was the accepted top limit of\nhuman potential because up until then, the fastest measured mile was four\nminutes and 1.4 seconds.\nGood thing Sir Roger Bannister didn’t get the memo.\nOn May 6th of that year, history was made when Bannister completed the mile\nin three minutes and 59.4 seconds, breaking the world record and shattering the\nmyth that no human being could run faster than a four-minute mile. Even more\nsurprising was the fact that although Bannister had competed in the 1952\nHelsinki Olympics, he had very little time to train for this world-record race as\nhe was also working as a junior doctor at the time. Still, he pulled it off . Was it\nbecause he didn’t get the medal he wanted in Helsinki and was driven to\naccomplish the “impossible” in order to redeem himself? Perhaps. Or was it\nsimply because he believed it could be done, and he was the man to do it?\nMaybe.\nWhatever gift or grace Bannister had working for him on that blustery day in\nEngland, one thing is for sure—the myth of human limit was replaced with the\npossibility of human potential. That Bannister shattered the myth of the fourminute mile being impossible to beat was proven just forty-six days later, when\nBannister’s rival John Landy broke his record, running the mile in three minutes\nand 57.9 seconds.\nIn working Profit First in my own business and helping entrepreneurs do the\nsame with their own companies, I can tell you that the biggest hindrance to a\nsuccessful implementation of this powerful plug-in is our own perception of\nlimits. Even after we start working the Profit First system, we are vulnerable to\ntired myths about what works and what doesn’t, what can be done and what can\nnever be achieved.\nProfit First falls apart when we buy into accepted notions of how financials\n“should” be managed:\n“It takes money to make money.” “You’ll make money at the end.”\n“If you want to make more money, you need to sell more.”\n“You just need to follow the accepted accounting principles. It’s all there.”\nThat last one is tough for most entrepreneurs to refute, because we hire\nbookkeepers, accountants and CPAs as experts. If they don’t agree with the\nProfit First system, maybe we should go back to our old way of doing things.\nRight?\nAh. . . nope.\nThe other day I got a call from Bob, an accountant affiliated with one of the\nbusinesses I was hired to consult with (and, let it be noted, Bob is not a PFP). He\nsaid, “You know, Mike, all of these bank accounts you set up, they’re a real pain\nin the ass. Each one needs to be reconciled, and there are constant transfers\nbetween them. All you need is one account. You can do all of these separate\naccounts on your general ledger. I mean, for God’s sake, Mike—it is so easy to\nbe profitable. Just do the accounting and all of this other stuff is unnecessary.”\nI blame my snarky response on a lack of sleep, because I don’t get ruffled too\noften. I said, “Bob, you have about two hundred clients, right?”\n“More like two-fifty.”\n“Wow, two hundred and fifty clients,” I said. “And you do all of the accounting\nfor them and prepare the tax returns and the P&L (profit and loss), the cash flow\nand balance sheets, right?”\n“Yep. Of course, Mike.”\n“And I suspect you tell them exactly what you told me,” I continued. “That they\njust need to do the accounting and look at the statements and it’s all right there in\nblack and white?”\n“Yes, absolutely. Where are you going with this?”\n“I just want to know,” I replied, “what percentage of your clients are truly\nprofitable. I want to know how many of your clients have a true chunk of\naccumulating cash sitting in their business at the end of each year. I would be\nshocked if it was even twenty percent.”\nRadio. Silence.\n“Is it less? Is it ten percent?” I pressed.\nStill no response from Bob, though I heard some heavy breathing on the other\nend (not the fun kind).\n“Are you saying that, just following the logic of accounting, less than five\npercent of your clients are profitable year in and year out, Bob?”\nClick.\n“Bob, are you there? Earth to Spock. Earth to Spock. Are you there, Spock?”\nIf it all boiled down to conventional wisdom, you would be rich and every\nbusiness would be profitable—and we’d still be running four-minute miles.\nThe fastest way to screw up Profit First is to start sliding back into old belief\nsystems that got you into trouble in the first place. It’s easy to do. The relief of\nfinally getting a handle on our finances and watching our profit rise can cause us\nto feel that our little cash flow problem is “fixed” and we can go back to using\nold-fashioned accounting methods, focusing on the top line and dumping our\nmoney in one account. We think, “I get this now. I don’t need to move money\naround to all of these accounts. I don’t have to withdraw my profit first on every\ndeposit.”\nThat kind of thinking, my friend, is like starting down a slippery slope. I’m not\nsure why you would choose that over the smooth path, but again I’ll just chalk it\nup to being human.\nIn this chapter, I’ll share a few more pitfalls to avoid as you work the Profit First\nsystem. Chief among them is the willingness to fall in line with conventional\nthinking. Fight the urge! Since Bannister beat the four-minute mile, runners have\nknocked seventeen seconds off that time. Seventeen seconds! Surely you can run\na profitable business—you won’t even have to break a sweat.\nGOING TOO BIG, TOO FAST\nIt is extremely common for entrepreneurs new to Profit First to start putting 20%\nor even 30% into their Profit Account right out of the gate. The next month they\nrealize they can’t afford it and pull the money back out to pay bills, which\ndefeats the entire process. You must allocate profit and not touch it, so you’ve\ngot to be sure that your business can handle the reduction in operating income.\nTo increase your profit, you need to become more efficient, to deliver the same\nor better results at a lower cost. Profit First works from the end goal backwards.\nOnce upon a time, you used to try to get more efficient in order to turn a profit.\nNow, by taking profit first, you must become efficient to support it. Same result,\nreverse-engineered.\nThis is why I suggest you start with a small percentage. Don’t fall into the trap\nof hogging all of the grub, taking too much profit up front and then shuffling\nmost of it back into your Operating Expenses Account when payroll comes due.\nStart with a small percentage to build the habit. Every quarter, move your Profit\nFirst allocation percentages closer to your goal by increasing them by an\nadditional one or two percent. Starting slowly will still force you to look for\nways to get better and more efficient at what you do, but you won’t be tempted\nto throw in the towel on the entire system because the pressure is too great or the\ntask “impossible.”\nRemember Jorge and Jose, the Profit First masters of the greater Miami area? At\none point, pumped at the results they had achieved with lower percentages, they\nallocated 20% to their Profit Account and quickly realized their business could\nnot support both that much profit and the tremendous growth they were\nexperiencing. So, they adjusted the percentage until they achieved a balance with\ntheir Profit Account allocation—high enough to make a real difference in their\nrainy day and celebration funds, but low enough that it did not hinder growth.\nJorge and Jose adjusted the Profit Account percentages on a regular basis,\nfactoring in short-and long-term needs and delaying equipment purchases they\ncouldn’t swing. They did everything right—and have a successful, thriving\nbusiness to show for it.\n“Too much of a good thing” is possible, even when it comes to watching your\nProfit Account grow rapidly. Whether you make this mistake at the outset of\nimplementing the Profit First system or down the road when the future looks\nespecially rosy, be sure to correct it as soon as possible or you’ll find yourself\nslipping back into the Survival Trap.\nCUTTING THE WRONG COSTS\nBy now, you know I’m a renewed frugality junkie. I get a high from saving\nmoney, and I get the biggest rush when I find a way to eliminate an expense\naltogether. Still, not all expenses should be cut. We need to invest in assets, and I\ndefine assets as things that bring more efficiency to your business by allowing\nyou to get more results at a lower cost per result. So, if an expense makes it\neasier to get better results, keep it or purchase it.\nI once toured the factory of a company that makes knives. When I noticed they\nwere using old tools, one of the owners said, “Yup. We even have systems from\nthe 1960s! We save so much money by keeping our old equipment.”\nDuring my tour, I also noticed that the knives they produced were inconsistent in\nterms of quality. Some of the knives were sharp; some were not. The handles\nrarely had a snug fit. Coincidentally, I had toured a different knife company\nearlier that week and noted that in one cumulative hour of manufacturing time\nthey were able to turn out one perfect knife after another at a volume four times\nthat of the company stuck in the decade of screaming Beatles fans and free love.\nMoney is made by efficiency—invest in it. If a purchase will bring up your\nbottom line and create significant efficiency, find ways to get the same results\nwith different or discounted equipment (or resources, or services) rather than cut\nthe cost.\n“PLOWING BACK” AND “REINVESTING”\nWe use fancy terms to justify taking money out of our different allocation\naccounts to cover expenses. Two that are used most often are “plowback” and\n“reinvest,” which are really just other ways to say, “borrow.” I have done this. I\n“plowed back” money from my Profit Account to cover operating expenses, and\nboy, do I regret it.\nWhen you don’t have enough money in your Operating Expenses Account to\ncover expenses, it is a big red flag that your expenses are too high and you need\nto find a way to fix them fast. Once in a blue moon, it could also mean that you\nare allocating too much to Owner’s Pay or Profit. This only happens when you\nstart with a high Profit or Owner’s Pay percentage. And when it happens, it is\nbecause you are taking a percentage of profit or pay that you are not yet able to\nsustain; the efficiencies are not yet in place to support your profitability. But\nagain, this is rarely the reason your Operating Expenses Account is in the red.\nLikewise, some entrepreneurs continue to use their credit cards for day-to-day\noperations and call them “lines of credit.” This is not accurate. It’s money you\ndon’t have. Your credit card bill is not an expense; it’s debt, plain and simple.\nUsing a credit card to cover what you can’t afford is also a red flag that your\nexpenses are too high. Stop using the credit card and reserve it for legitimate\nemergencies or unique circumstances (like for a purchase you must make to\nyield income).\nRAIDING THE TAX ACCOUNT\nIn the first year or two of doing Profit First, you may get caught in a tax bind\nbecause you only pay your estimates. For example, your accountant may prepare\nestimates based on your business’s prior year’s income and profitability that say\nyou should make payments of $5000 every quarter.\nAs your Profit Account and Tax Account grow, you may be surprised to see that\nyou’re reserving about $8000 in taxes each quarter. Seeing this, you might think,\n“Hey, my accountant said I should pay $5000 per quarter. I’m reserving too\nmuch for taxes.” A little voice inside your head may even say, “Don’t touch that\nmoney, you’ll probably need it for taxes.” And then a louder voice will say,\n“Nah, don’t worry about it, you probably won’t owe it and even if you do, you\nhave time.” Cue the $3000 withdrawal to pay yourself, or pay bills. (A still\nlouder voice—one I’ve may have heard myself—might say: “Why not start\nleasing a brand new sports car with that money? Not only is it a business\nexpense, you will instantly become the sexiest beast on this planet.” Do not\nlisten! Danger, Will Robinson! Danger!)\nBig mistake.\nAs your profitability grows, your taxes will too. In fact, paying more taxes is an\nindicator that your business health is improving. Now, I am not saying you\nshould ever pay more taxes than you need to (tax is just an expense like any\nother), but do realize that your taxes will grow as your business health does. So\ndon’t steal from your Tax Account thinking you won’t need that money for\ntaxes. You will.\nAt times, you may even need more than you think. I messed up when I paid my\nestimated taxes every quarter and then used the extra money to increase my\nOwner’s Pay when I discovered there was money left over. Dummy! Tax\nestimates are based on your prior year’s income. If you make more profit this\nyear (which you will), you will pay more taxes, but your tax estimates will not\nchange. If you spend “leftover” money from your Tax Account simply because\nyou allocate more than the estimate, you will be in shock come tax time.\nTalk to your PFP every quarter to gauge how you are doing on taxes. And don’t\ntake money out of that Tax Account! Your business is growing by leaps and\nbounds, and higher taxes are definitely in your future.\nAnother tax issue has to do with paying down debt. I call this “paying for your\nsins,” because if you have debt you need to wipe out, implementing Profit First\nis going to hurt in the beginning. I should know—it happened to me.\nHere’s the problem: The government gives you a tax break on expenses but does\nnot consider the money you reserve to pay down debt an expense. The actual\ncharges on your credit card and the interest and credit card fees can be expensed,\nbut not your payments to pay down your cards.\nI can’t believe I’m saying this, but in this case, the government is right. You get\nthe tax benefit in the year that you make the purchase— no matter if you paid for\nthe expense in cash, by credit card or with funds from a bank loan or line of\ncredit. As you become profitable and pay off debt, you will pay taxes on that\nincome. Eliminating debt and paying taxes will feel like a double whammy. It\nisn’t—you just need to pay for your “sins.”\n• • •\nMy own business—and life—has turned around for the better because of Profit\nFirst. I am eternally grateful for the financial stability and freedom it has given\nme. But I also know how easy it is to fall off of the Profit First wagon. It’s\nhappened to me, and I’ve seen it happen to many businesses. Not only do people\nfall off the wagon, it rolls all over them.\nIt’s easy to fall back into the old ways because they seem to make sense (they\ndon’t), or because our accountant says we shouldn’t bother (we should), or\nbecause we think we were happier doing things the old way (we weren’t).\nI’ll leave you with a quote from the great Sir Roger Bannister, who busted\nthrough the myth that the four-minute mile could not be beat: “The man who can\ndrive himself further once the effort gets painful is the man who will win.”\nRight-o, Sir Roger.\nACTION STEP\nGET REAL WITH YOUR ACCOUNTANT\nThe Only Step: Sit down with your accountant, preferably a PFP trained in this\nsystem, and come up with a game plan to ensure that you don’t end up allocating\ntoo much revenue to your Profit Account and you do allocate enough to your\nTax Account. Schedule quarterly checkins to make sure you are consistently\nbuilding up your profit and other allocations while reducing your operating\nexpenses.\nCHAPTER TWELVE: Financial Freedom Is Just a\nFew Clicks Away\nLife is better on the other side of the street. That’s not just a metaphor—I\nliterally live directly across from the house I lived in when my life fell apart due\nto my own arrogance and belief in top line business principles. And let me tell\nyou, life is much, much better on this side. Not just because we’re living in a\nhouse that we love. Not just because I took home and kept more salaried income\nlast year than I’ve ever earned in my life. Life is better because I am no longer a\nslave to my monthly nut. The Frankenstein monster has become a beautiful\nClydesdale workhorse.\nRunning a Profit First business and lifestyle has given me complete confidence\nover my finances and freed me from the endless search for a big payout. I’m no\nlonger looking for the Holy Grail—I don’t need it. My businesses are profitable\ntoday, and they will continue to be profitable tomorrow, next month and in the\nyears to come. I am stringing together small financial win after small financial\nwin— every 10th and 25th of the month.\nFrom my family room window, I can see my old driveway, my old yard, the\nfront door I entered that memorable Valentine’s Day when I faced the reality\nthat I’d lost everything. That day, after my daughter slid her piggy bank across\nthe dining room table to me, I stared at it for a few moments, stunned silent.\nThough the piggy bank was in near-perfect condition, Adayla had secured the\nbottom stopper with clear sticky tape, duct tape and rubber bands. That’s when I\nremembered a lesson I had long forgotten.\nI recalled an earlier conversation when I asked, “Angel, why do you have all that\ntape over your piggy bank’s belly? That stopper works just fi ne.”\nPROFIT FIRST\nShe had said, “I’m saving for my own horse, Daddy. Every Sunday when you\nand Mommy give me my chore money, I run upstairs and put it in here. I don’t\nwant it ever coming out, until I have my horse.” That’s when it hit me: My nineyear- old daughter had a far better understanding of money management than I\ndid. It was the most humbling moment of my life.\nI pushed the piggy bank back to her and said, “Honey, this is yours. We will be\nfine. I will make sure of it. I will fix what I have broken. But thank you. Thank\nyou from the bottom of my heart.”\nAs low as I felt that day, my daughter’s selfless act gave me the courage to let go\nof my tired ideology and not just recover from my financial problems, but fix\nthem permanently.\nThe normal response to fixing problems is to try to change our habits. In The\nPower of Habit Charles Duhigg says habits are “click, whirr.” Triggered by\nsomething (like an empty bank account)—click— we go into our reactionary\nroutine, like making panicky collection calls, for example—whirr. As Duhigg\npoints out in his book, changing habits is possible but is also really, really hard.\nInstead, simple systems that capture the good parts of our habits and guard us\nfrom the bad parts will bring about positive and permanent change, fast.\nThat’s all Profit First is—a simple system that works with us as we are. All you\nhave to do is follow it. You don’t have to get an MBA, or take an accounting\ncourse, or start devouring articles in The Wall Street Journal. You don’t have to\nchange or “fix” who you are for this to work. It just does.\nWhy would I ask you to change who you are? You have been able to grow your\nown, amazing business doing what you do, and that’s remarkable by any\nmeasure. Now, all we need to do is capture your good money habits and put\nguard rails up to protect you from your “humanness.”\nIt really is that simple. We are going to put profit first. Period. You don’t need a\nmiracle, or a lucky night in Vegas. You don’t need\na windfall, or a colossal client, or a worldwide phenomenon to realize the vision\nyou’ve held for your business since you opened your first box of business cards.\nYou simply need to put your profit first and everything else will fall into line.\nMy daughter, now fifteen, paid her way to Europe with that piggy bank money,\nand she’s close to having enough to buy her horse. It’s not rocket science, and\nyou don’t have to have a truckload of karma to get it. Financial freedom really is\njust a few small plates away.\nLife is better on the other side of the street. Putting your profit first makes it\npretty easy to get there.\nYou know how, at the end of some movies, after the credits roll, there’s a little\nbonus footage? Like in Ferris Bueller’s Day Off, when Ferris comes back on the\nscreen and says, “You’re still here? It’s over. Go home. Go.”\nIt’s like a little treat for everyone who stayed to watch the credits.\nYour bonus for sticking it out, facing the music and slogging through heady\ncontent is this:\nIf logic worked, everyone would be rich. It’s simple—spend less than you make.\nBut you’ve always known that, and now you know that logic alone doesn’t\nwork. Leveraging your emotions and behavior is the most powerful profitmaking tool. Profit first. Always.\nYou’re still here? It’s over. Go make some money.

It’s about how\na chief financial officer (CFO) becomes a Lean CFO to lead the transformation of a company’s management accounting system into a lean management accounting system.\nIt’s been well established in lean companies that traditional management accounting systems do not provide relevant and reliable information to decision makers. The CFO, as steward of a company’s management\naccounting system, must provide the leadership to improve the quality of\nthe information produced by a company’s management accounting system\nso it is aligned with a company’s lean strategy, lean operations, and continuous improvement.\nThe integration of a lean management accounting system with a\ncompany’s lean strategy will lead to improved decision making by all users\nand drive long-term financial success. Lean management accounting\nhelps all users, from executives to line managers, better understand\nthe relationships between lean operating performance and financial\nperformance.\nWritten in the style of a practice guide, The Lean CFO is written not just\nfor CFOs, but for all stakeholders of a company’s management accounting\nsystem, such as executives and owners, lean leaders, functional managers,\nand accounting professionals.\n\nThe Lean CFO\nSecond Edition\nNicholas S.

What I recognized when\nI re-read it is that how I think about, teach, and explain lean management\naccounting has changed since the first edition was published.\nSo, in the spirit of continuous improvement, I decided to write a second\nedition. The layout of the second edition now follows a lean management\naccounting transformation process. The entire book has been re-written to\nbe industry neutral, rather than manufacturing centric. Another objective\nin re-writing was to better explain how lean management accounting and\nlean practices work together to create a lean management accounting\nsystem.\nI’d like to thank the following people for their help and support in writing\nthis book:\n• Deanna Katko – for supporting me all the way and encouraging me.\n• Karyn Ross – for her editing of the book.\n• Michael Sinocchi and Samantha Dalton of Taylor & Francis for\nagreeing to publish a second edition.\n• Every company I have ever worked with – working with you allowed\nme to improve my approach to teaching and consulting on lean management accounting.\nI hope you enjoy reading the book and best wishes on your lean management accounting transformation!\n\nix\nAbout the Author\nNicholas S.

But if management accounting is viewed as a system,\nas illustrated in Figure 1.1, accounting is only a small part. The management accounting system consists of a vast database of financial and nonfinancial information in various systems that record, store and synthesize\nthe information. It consists of every user of the information, from senior\nleaders all the way down to line managers. It consists of all the analytical\nand decision-making practices all these users perform. Accounting is the\nsteward of the system; it is also a user, and it is an analytical service provider to other users.\nWhen a company commits to a lean strategy, all processes, systems,\npeople, actions and information in the company must be aligned to the\nstrategy to ensure success. This means a company’s management accounting\nsystem must become its lean management accounting system.\nThis is a transformation process, and this book is written to explain that\nprocess. Figure 1.2 illustrates the basic architecture of a lean management\naccounting system and is also how this book is laid out:\n2 • The Lean Management Accounting System\nLean\nmanagement\naccounting\nsystem\nAccounting\nfunction\nFinancial &\nnon-financial\ninformation\nInformation\nsystems Users\nAnalysis &\ndecisionmaking\nFIGURE 1.1\nManagement Accounting System\nUnderstandable\nUseful\nTimely\nVerifiable\nValid\nLean Thinking\nLeadership\nQuality Decision Making\nRelevant information Reliable information\nFIGURE 1.2\nArchitecture of a Lean Management Accounting System\nThe Lean Management Accounting System • 3\n• Chapter 2: Leading a Lean Accounting Transformation – for a lean\nmanagement accounting transformation to be successful, it is essential that the CFO become a Lean CFO to lead the transformation.

Chapter 9 explains how to eliminate waste in standard\ncosting systems. Chapter 10 explains how to eliminate waste in ERP\ntransaction processing. Chapter 11 explains how to “turn off standard\ncosting” for inventory valuation purposes.\n4 • The Lean Management Accounting System\n• Appendix: Lean Management Accounting Transformation\nChecklists – these checklists have been designed to help plan and\nmanage your lean management accounting transformation.

As a management team,\nbefore we began our lean transformation, we read The Machine That\nChanged the World. What I got out of the book was that lean was something “done” in manufacturing operations, and it made sense to me.\nWe hired a vice president of manufacturing with lean experience, and\nhe immediately began developing a relationship with me regarding how I,\nand accounting, could help the transformation by providing better financial and non-financial information. He also made sure to include me in\noperational meetings where lean plans were discussed and went out of his\nway to explain the “whys” of the plan.\nLittle did I know, he was working on teaching me about lean and helping\nme adopt a different mindset about what lean is. He was coaching me on\nthe importance of accounting providing operations the right information.\nHe was helping me become a Lean CFO, which I figured out when I began\nconnecting the operational improvements made to Bullard’s improved\nfinancial performance. After I made these connections, I was “all in” on\nlean. I became a lean leader within the company and began thinking of\nmyself as a Lean CFO.\nOver the years in working with many companies, I have seen other CFOs\n(and controllers, cost accountants, accounting managers and analysts) go\nthrough the same transformation, where they mentally now put “lean” as\nthe first word in their job title. I’ve also seen others adopt a “wait and see”\napproach – it makes sense to them, but they want to “see” something (what\nthey want to see is usually vague) before committing. A “wait and see”\napproach does not work for accounting leaders in a lean transformation.\n6 • Leading a Lean Management Accounting Transformation\nIn lean companies, it’s essential that the CFO become a Lean CFO early\nin the lean management accounting transformation process because you\nmust be the leader. In smaller companies you may be actively involved in\ntransformation activities. In larger companies, you probably will delegate\nthe detail work to others in accounting, but ultimately you are leading them.\nWhat I’m going to explain next are the behaviors a Lean CFO needs to\nlead the transformation as well as broad methods the Lean CFO can use to\nenable the success of the transformation.\nBECOME THE ROLE MODEL\nSuccessful leaders are role models, genuinely practicing the thinking,\nbehaviors, and characteristics they want those they lead to emulate. As\na senior leader in the company, a CFO’s words, actions and behavior are\nwatched by everyone. Those watching can spot a fake miles away, so it’s\nimportant that the Lean CFO’s beliefs and behaviors are genuine. Here is a\nsummary of what you need to do:\n• Change your thinking – you must believe in the benefits of lean management accounting before you begin a transformation. It’s important\nto understand how lean can drive financial improvement over time.\nAs a leader, it is important to communicate a clear vision and/or goals\nregarding lean management accounting and how it will benefit the\ncompany.\n• You will learn with everyone else – a lean management accounting\ntransformation is really a long-term learning experience for you, for\naccounting and for all users of management accounting information.\nWhen others see you learning, they will open their minds to learning.\n• Show you care about people – show that you care about people as\nthey go through the process of learning how to use a lean management accounting system. There will be those who “get it” quickly and\nothers that may take more time learning. Help everyone work through\nthe learning process. Be a coach by asking, listening, engaging and\ninfluencing others in a positive way.\n• Don’t let interruptions get in the way – I’ve seen some companies and\nCFOs put a pause on a lean management accounting transformation\nLeading a Lean Management Accounting Transformation • 7\nfor “business reasons” that from my viewpoint appear to be a normal\npart of running a business, rather than extraordinary economic\nevents. Pausing the transformation tells everyone lean management\naccounting is not that important.\nINTEGRATE LEAN MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTING\nINTO THE LEAN STRATEGY\nSenior leaders of the company must give unequivocal and unwavering\nsupport to developing and using a lean management accounting system.\nSenior leaders must make lean management accounting an essential part\nof a company’s overall lean strategy. As with any component of a strategy,\nlean management accounting must have an action plan to develop and\ndeploy over time. If it is not part of the company’s lean strategy, a transformation will not be successful. As a Lean CFO, and member of the senior\nleadership team, you must work to make this happen.\nLean management accounting is a company commitment because of\nthe many users of the information and analytical services a management\naccounting system provides. These users are in every function in a company, and they are the customers of the lean management accounting\nsystem. As customers, they define the quality standards for the information and analytical practices in a lean management accounting system.\nFor these reasons it is important to include users in the lean management\naccounting transformation.\nUSE LEAN PRACTICES AS THE FOUNDATION\nFOR THE TRANSFORMATION\nA lean management accounting transformation is not like a project with a\ndefinitive end. It is just like a lean transformation, which begins and really\nnever ends because there are always opportunities to improve and serve\ncustomers better.\nThe format and content of this book are laid out as a general roadmap\nof how to execute a lean management accounting transformation. In the\n8 • Leading a Lean Management Accounting Transformation\nbook I’ll explain the numbers of lean management accounting and how\nthey are integrated with lean practices and used in analysis and decision\nmaking. What I am going to explain here is how to apply some specific lean\nconcepts and practices to the transformation process to enable success.\nCustomer Value\nAs you will read in the next chapter, customer value is the first principle of\nlean. It is really the overarching purpose of lean – to serve customers better.\nThe same holds true for lean management accounting. It needs to serve its\ncustomers (users of information) better by providing them useful, understandable, relevant and timely information and analytical practices that are\naligned with lean. This needs to be clearly understood by both accounting,\nthe supplier of products and services, and its customers, the users.\nContinuous Improvement\nA difference between conventional management accounting systems and\nlean management accounting is that lean companies will strive to continuously improve their systems for two reasons. The first is that improvement\nmay be required to meet the changing needs of its customers. The second is\nthat companies must also strive to continually eliminate waste in lean management accounting systems. Those wastes are summarized in Figure 2.1.\nDefects • information not useful to users\nOverproduction • reports not used by users\nWaiting • users waiting for information\n• accounting performing work below their\nskill level Neglect of talent\nTransportation • handoffs of information between systems\nInventory • batch processing of information\nMotion • meetings to understand information\n• unnecessary transactions, reporting and\nanalyses Excess processing\nFIGURE 2.1\nManagement Accounting System Waste\nLeading a Lean Management Accounting Transformation • 9\nWaste exists in every process, in every company. It is a matter of making\nthe waste visible in order to improve. Figure 2.2 expands on Figure 2.1 by\nillustrating the actual types of waste which are typically present in manufacturing management accounting systems. As will be explained in the\nnext chapter, eliminating waste creates capacity, or, in other words, more\ntime, which can be applied to more value added activities. In lean management accounting this means accounting can spend more time on value\nadded analysis and those who report information into systems can be freed\nup and reassigned to value added work.\nContinuous improvement also forms the foundation of the lean management accounting transformation process and is effective in changing\n“project-based” thinking. Breaking down what sounds to others like\na massive project into smaller improvement events makes it easier for\neveryone to grasp.\nFigure 2.3 illustrates the typical steps in a lean management accounting\ntransformation process. In the beginning of a transformation, an initial\nfuture state for each step must be completed before moving on to the next\nstep. For each step, further improvement opportunities are identified, and\nsubsequent future states are created. Ask anyone at a company where lean\nmanagement accounting has been in place for a number of years, and they\nwill tell you how much their system has evolved over time.\nDefects • product costs, variances and absorption\nOverproduction • reports produced and ignored by operations\nWaiting • users waiting for information that is not timely\n• accounting processing information instead of Neglect of talent analyzing\n• information handoffs – systems, spreadsheets,\nreports Transportation\nInventory • monthly reporting; annual rate setting\nMotion • meetings and communication to explain numbers\n• shop floor reporting, time tracking, detailed rate\nsetting Excess processing\nFIGURE 2.2\nExamples of Waste in Manufacturing Management Accounting\n10\n• Leading a Lean Management Accounting Transformation Complete pilot Use in daily lean management Use for weekly value stream operational review Use in continuous improvement Use for on- going operational decision making Use in profitability analyses Integrate into sales and supply chain decision making Integrate into all planning, budgeting and forecasting activities P D C A P D C A P D C A P D C A P D C A P D C A P D C A P D C A FIGURE 2.3 Continuous Improvement Cycles for Lean Accounting\nnewgenrtpdf\nLeading a Lean Management Accounting Transformation • 11\nUse PDCA\nIt is inevitable that a lean management accounting transformation will\nencounter problems, issues and obstacles. Some of these may be known\nup front and others may arise during the transformation process. Using\nPDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Adjust) is the proven lean method for solving\nproblems.\nLean companies use PDCA as the framework for teaching employees\nhow to solve problems and for all improvement activities. It is equally\napplicable to all issues encountered in the lean management accounting\ntransformation process. Using PDCA will get to the root cause of the\nproblem, and once the actual root cause is known, solutions can be put in\nplace to eliminate, or reduce the effect of, the root cause.\nFocus on Thinking\nUsers process the information from management accounting systems in\ntheir analytical and decision-making activities. They think using the information, draw conclusions and recommend actions. In a lean management\naccounting transformation, there will be some new numbers to use in\nexisting analytical practices, some new analytical practices, and some analytical practices which may need to stop.\nAll this change may be very difficult for some decision makers, and their\nreactions may appear to indicate they are resisting or pushing back on the\nchanges. Don’t make those assumptions. Assume they need more time to\npractice and learn new thinking habits, and provide coaching for them to\nfacilitate the learning process.\nThe best people to serve as coaches to users are those in finance and\naccounting who have the most interaction with the users, such as\ncontrollers, cost accountants and analysts. These accounting team members\nshould be developed into “lean accountants” early in the lean management\naccounting transformation. How should this be done? Using the same process you use to become a Lean CFO!\nThere are other benefits of developing lean accounting coaches. One\nbenefit is breaking down the artificial functional barriers and developing\nstronger relationships between accounting and other functions. The other\nbenefit is that lean accounting coaches learn more about how lean practices\nare being applied in the company, and begin making connections to financial performance.\n12 • Leading a Lean Management Accounting Transformation\nStart with Pilots\nLean transformations begin with pilots, such as taking one linear production cell, turning it into a U-shaped cell and creating single piece flow\nthrough the cell. This is done so the team can actually experience lean\npractices and others can see how lean practices work. Lean pilots demonstrate the benefits of lean physical flow.\nPiloting lean management accounting in analysis and decision making\ndoes the same, it proves the benefits of improving the quality of decision making. When I work with companies on their lean management\naccounting transformations, the first step is to pilot lean management\naccounting in one value stream, by developing its box score and using the\nbox score in some basic operating decision making.\nPiloting lean management accounting in one value stream also can\nmake visible problems or issues that must be dealt with in subsequent\ndeployments to other value streams. The PDCA approach can adjust the\ndeployment plan to mitigate these problems in other value streams.\nThe pilot team, with real life experience under their belt, can also serve as\nlean management accounting coaches. Because they have experienced the\nentire process, they are in a position to help others. This is invaluable as the\ntransformation is expanded into all parts of the company.\nWRAP UP: YOU ARE THE HEAD COACH\nAt the same time Bullard began its lean transformation, I was coaching\nour younger son’s youth baseball team (ages 9–12). I quickly learned that\nas their coach they were watching my every move and reaction, whether\nin practice or during games. They were also listening to every word I said,\nand how I said it. The kids on the team were also at different levels of skills,\nexperience and confidence. I realized I needed to coach each player individually, based on where they were in developing baseball skills, and I also\nneeded to coach the team collectively in how to play as a team. It was also\nobvious to me that they could tell the difference between me being genuine\nand phony.\nThe most important lesson I learned from coaching the team was that it\nreally was no different from being a CFO!\nLeading a Lean Management Accounting Transformation • 13\nThe accounting department was my “team” of players. I had to follow\nthe same coaching practices with them that I used with the baseball team.\nAlso, as a member of the senior management team, I had the same obligation to all the other employees in the company as I did with the accounting\nteam. I stopped thinking of myself as a manager (and acting like one) and\nstarted thinking and acting like a coach.\nThe result? We were a close-knit team that embraced improving together.\nWe developed strong relationships with each other. We truly enjoyed the\ntime we spent together.\nWe won the youth league championship that year.\nWe started a successful lean management accounting transformation the\nsame year.\nYou, and your company, can also “win” a lean management accounting\ntransformation with leadership. Now let’s dive into the details on how to\nmake lean management accounting a reality.\n\nDOI: 10.4324/9781003304098-3 15\n3\nLean is the Strategy\nINTRODUCTION\nIf an architect is going to design a new building, they must start with the\nfoundation of the building. A poorly designed foundation will not be\nable to support the building. Applying this analogy to lean management\naccounting, the foundation that’s needed is lean thinking.\nBased on my experience, there are five aspects of lean that create the\nstrong foundation for a lean management accounting system:\n• Lean is the strategy\n• The value stream organization\n• People solving problems\n• Lean operating practices\n• The economics of lean\nThe relationships between each of these aspects of lean and a lean management accounting system need to be understood by a Lean CFO in\nplanning and executing a lean management accounting transformation.\nWhat follows is a high level summary of each of these aspects rather than a\ndetailed explanation of lean practices.\nLEAN IS THE STRATEGY\nTo achieve financial success with lean, it must be the strategy of a company.\nSome companies understand this, but other companies think lean is a\n16 • Lean is the Strategy\ncomponent of their strategy. This distinction may not seem that important,\nbut it has a dramatic impact on what a company thinks it can accomplish\noperationally and financially with lean.\nIf a company thinks lean is “part” of a business strategy, then it usually selectively implements certain lean practices or rationalizes its current\nbusiness practices as “being lean.” In the lean community, this is known by\nthe acronym LINO (“Lean in name only”) and is a “tools-based” approach\nto lean. This approach usually leads to employees thinking of lean as what\nsome people call “the flavor of the month” – just another initiative senior\nleaders are rolling out that will eventually go away, and the company will\nreturn to business as usual.\nAnother possible outcome of approaching lean in this manner is that\nlean is restarted multiple times. Selected lean practices are put into place\nbut not sustained. Lean practices regress back to old non-lean practices.\nThen a few years later, the company tries to restart lean, and the same cycle\nrepeats itself. To avoid these common pitfalls, it’s best to think of lean as the\nstrategy of the company.\nCustomer Value\nLean is a business strategy based on serving customers better. To actually serve customers better, a company must clearly understand value\nfrom the customer’s perspective, and it must actually deliver the value the\ncustomers want. By doing both, a company will change the dynamics of its\nrelationships with customers and its competition.\nIt’s not difficult to determine what most customers want from companies\nthey buy products and services from. Customers expect quality, as defined\nby the customer. Customers expect on-time delivery, based on when they\nwant the product or service delivered. Customers also expect an overall\nsatisfying experience in dealing with the company beyond quality and\ndelivery.\nCustomer value is created every time a customer has an encounter with a\ncompany. Think of all the encounters your customers have with your company outside of the actual use of your product or service. Placing an order,\nreceiving and paying the invoice, after-sales support, navigating your website and the ease of talking to a person in your company; these are just\nsome examples of where value can be created. Lean companies understand\nLean is the Strategy • 17\nthese touch points between a company and its customers are all opportunities to serve customers better.\nAn effective lean management accounting system is one that focuses on\nservicing its customers (who happen to be internal users) better. What the\ncustomers of a lean management accounting system value is the same as\nwhat your external customers value from your company:\n• Quality – useful and understandable information that is based on\nlean thinking rather than traditional business practices.\n• Delivery – the useful and understandable information must be timely\nand available to users for the particular analysis or decision they are\nmaking.\n• Service – accounting must provide value in decision support for\ninternal users rather than being aloof, isolated or disengaged from\nlean.\nA Lean Strategy is Principle-Based\nWhat separates lean from other business strategies is that it is based on a\nfew principles rather than specific goals that change year-to-year. If you\nwould like to learn in detail about the principles of lean, I recommend\nfinding one of many great lean books that are available. What I’m going to\ndo here is to summarize them in a few paragraphs, then explain in more\ndetail how lean principles also apply to lean management accounting.\nLean originated in Toyota as the Toyota Production System and its principal architect, Taiichi Ohno, articulated two basic principles: continuous\nimprovement and respect for people. Continuous improvement focuses on\nlong-term improvement rather than short-term gains. Respect for people\nis basically about listening to the employees who perform the work because\nthey are closest to the real problems, and oftentimes have the best solutions\nto the problems.\nThe actual term “lean” was introduced by Jim Womack and Daniel Jones\nin the book Lean Thinking. In this book, they described five principles of\nlean to better explain how the Toyota Production System could apply to\nany business, not just an automotive manufacturer. The five principles they\nexplained were: customer value, value streams, flow and pull, pursuing\nperfection, and empowering employees.\n18 • Lean is the Strategy\nBecause the principles of lean are consistent and don’t change year-toyear like traditional strategic objectives, they force the leaders of companies to take a long-term view of a business.\nLean principles also serve as a “True North” to align all initiatives,\nactions and operating practices around a few basic principles. The purpose\nof lean practices, tools and methods is supported by the principles. Lean\nprinciples are very good at answering “why” questions such as:\n• Why do we have to improve?\n• Why do we need to understand waste?\n• Why do we have to adopt lean practices such as kanban?\nLean principles should be used to develop a corresponding set of lean\nmanagement accounting principles which can be used as a foundation to\ndrive a lean management accounting transformation. Lean management\naccounting principles can be used to answer the “why does the current\nmanagement accounting system have to change?” questions that will arise.\nFigure 3.1 illustrates how to develop lean management accounting\nsystem principles based on the five principles of lean. A lean management\naccounting system creates value for its customers by providing relevant and\nreliable information that is aligned to value streams. The information needs\nto be available to users when it is needed.

The\nlean management accounting system is also a system designed for enabling\nlearning, so users can learn the dynamic cause–effect relationships\nbetween lean operating performance and financial performance to drive\nlong-term financial success.\nNow let’s look at the next aspect of lean, the value stream organization,\nand its impact on a lean management accounting system.\nVALUE STREAM ORGANIZATION\nIn order to serve customers better, a lean company must gain insight and\nunderstanding as to exactly how it serves its customers, which are the value\nstreams of a company. Figure 3.2 summarizes the definition of a value\nstream. A value stream is the sequence of process steps from the time a\ncustomer places an order to the time the customer receives the product or\nservice, executed at the proper time. The process steps of a value stream\nflow horizontally through the traditional vertical, departmental organizational structure of a company.\nIn proper\nsequence\nAt proper\ntime\nTo create\nvalue for a\ncustomer\nIncludes\ninformation\nto\ncoordinate\nactions\nActions\ntaken\nFIGURE 3.2\nDefinition of a Value Stream\n20 • Lean is the Strategy\nThe first step in creating a value stream organization is to identify a\ncompany’s value streams. This is a logical, rational exercise that is conducted\nthrough direct observation from the time of receipt of a customer order to\nthe shipment of the product or delivery of a service. This exercise is sometimes called “stapling yourself to an order.”\nExperience matters in the process of identifying value streams. It’s best\nfor someone who has done this before to facilitate the process to avoid\ncommon mistakes such as:\n• Assuming that “we already know” our value streams intuitively.\n• Identifying value streams by sitting around a table in a conference\nroom.\n• Top-down identification of value streams by senior leaders.\n• A never-ending discussion about what a company’s value streams are.\nAfter value streams have been identified, the next step is to organize around\nthe value streams. Lean companies focus on optimizing value stream\noperating performance rather than optimizing performance of vertical\ndepartments. Lean companies improve by value stream rather than random\nimprovement by departments. Lean companies plan by value stream rather\nthan by traditional top-down planning methods. This requires a level of\nvalue stream organization.\nA common misperception when people hear “create a value stream\norganization” is that it means an organizational restructuring of the company, which is difficult to do. The common approach to creating the value\nstream organization is to develop a matrix organization where value\nstream teams have responsibility and accountability for horizontal flow:\noperational control, improvement and overall management of the value\nstreams, as summarized in Figure 3.3. The vertical departments still exist\nmore as “subject matter experts” providing value stream teams with technical standards and support.\nHere is a simple example. In a traditional manufacturing company, the\nquality department performs quality inspections in operations as well as\nmaintaining overall quality standards for the company. In a value stream\norganization, the quality department still sets and maintains overall quality\nstandards, but the actual inspection activities are incorporated into the\ndaily work of the employees in each value stream.\nLean is the Strategy • 21\nA lean management accounting system is value stream centric. In\norder to optimize value stream performance, it must be measured. The\nrelationships between value stream operating performance and financial\nperformance must be clearly understood by everyone. Lean management\naccounting systems must transition away from traditional cost-based\ninformation, such as product costs or actual-to-budget reports, and provide the useful and understandable information for effective value stream\nmanagement.\nCONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT = PEOPLE\nSOLVING PROBLEMS\nMany companies claim they focus on improvement, but oftentimes this\nis more a traditional top-down approach where company leaders dictate initiatives. Many companies also consider firefighting a form of\nimprovement. Lean companies take a different approach. Lean companies focus on people solving problems because they understand that\nthe employees who do the work understand the root causes of problems\nthe best.\nIn lean companies, improvement is not random, haphazard or dictated\nby top management. Lean companies use the scientific method as a framework for teaching employees how to solve problems. The application of\nthe scientific method inside a lean company usually goes by the acronym\nPDCA (plan, do, check, adjust), A-3 Thinking or simply lean problem\nOrganizational\nchanges\n• reduce or eliminate\ndepartments\n• change reporting\nrelationships\n• difficult to do\ninitially, but possible\nSelf-directed teams\n• teams have\nresponsibility and\nauthority\n• dotted-line reporting\nto functional\nmanagers and\nleaders\n• recommended\napproach\nFIGURE 3.3\nMethods to Create a Value Stream Organization\n22 • Lean is the Strategy\nsolving (in this book I’m going to use PDCA to describe lean problem\nsolving).\nThe first step in the problem solving is to be able to properly identify a\nproblem. Lean companies recognize that not all problems are created equal,\nand different types of problems require different responses. Figure 3.4\nsummarizes how most lean companies categorize problems. Let’s take a\nlook at each type of problem and typical responses.\nNo Standard\nExperienced lean practitioners understand that problems cannot be identified, and true continuous improvement cannot take place, if there is no\nstandard of performance. Another way to think about this is “what should\nbe happening.” It is important to identify if this is the “current state” of\na process because this problem needs to be solved first. Developing a\nstandard of performance is about creating a level of stability in process\nperformance to be able to begin troubleshooting and identify gaps from\nstandards.\nTroubleshooting\nLean companies recognize problems will occur and methods must exist to\nreact to problems as they occur. Troubleshooting is simply having standard\nresponses to abnormal conditions and is also known as short-term\ncountermeasures. Effective troubleshooting is the opposite of traditional\nNo standard • process has no standards of performance\nTroubleshooting • immediate responses to abnormal conditions\nGap from standard • actual performance did not meet standard\n• create a new, improved standard of\nperformance Improve the standard\nFIGURE 3.4\nTypes of Problems\nLean is the Strategy • 23\nbusiness firefighting. It requires the people who work in a process to recognize abnormal conditions as they arise and react in a standard, methodical\nfashion. Effective troubleshooting mitigates the impact of the problem on\nprocess performance.\nThe classic lean example of troubleshooting is the ability of an assembly\nline operator in Toyota to “stop the line” if an abnormal condition is identified. This creates an Andon (a signal) for a team of people to go to where\nthe problem exists to troubleshoot and restart the assembly line.\nGap from Standard\nHaving performance standards in place allows for measuring actual performance against the standards. The objective of identifying gaps from\nstandard is for a process team to understand the root causes of the gaps\nand make the necessary improvements to eliminate the gaps. One example\nis schedule attainment, where a process has a schedule of work to meet (the\nstandard), such as completing specific orders for a day. If the schedule is\nnot achieved, there is a gap from standard and the team’s responsibility is\nto understand the root causes.\nImproving the Standard\nThis is proactive problem solving – by planning and conducting structured\nimprovement events to create a new improved standard of performance\n(the future state). This is what most people think when they hear “continuous improvement.” The most common example is a multi-day kaizen\nevent, where a team of people work on one specific problem, such as reducing the set-up time on a machine by 50% or reducing month-end close by\nthree days.\nA process problem can only be identified if process performance is\nmeasured. Process performance standards are numbers, such as on-time\ndelivery, lead time or scrap rates. An effective lean management accounting\nsystem must provide process teams with timely performance measurements\nthat allow them to identify each type of problem and measure the effectiveness of troubleshooting and improvements. The reporting of the performance measurements must match the speed at which a process must\nrespond to problems.\n24 • Lean is the Strategy\nLEAN OPERATING PRACTICES\nAnother characteristic of companies that have achieved successful lean\ntransformations is they focus on integrating lean thinking into the fabric of\neveryday work through a variety of tools and methods, some of which are\nsummarized in Figure 3.5. Another way to think of this is lean is practiced\nevery day, everywhere, by everybody, all the time. This means the strategy\nis being executed on a daily basis.\nCreating flow, at the pull of the customer, is probably the hardest part of\nbecoming a truly lean company. Another way to explain this is that any process should be as fast as possible to meet the exact demand of the customer.\nThis is difficult because establishing flow requires “system-thinking”: the\nentire value stream needs to work in a coordinated manner to meet exact,\nspecific customer needs and maintain productivity levels. This requires\neveryone working in a value stream to have a good understanding of customer needs – both the company’s customers and also all downstream process steps in the value stream.\nThis difficulty is overcome by using value stream mapping. A current\nstate map, as illustrated in Figure 3.6, makes visible what is preventing\nflow. A future state map, as illustrated in Figure 3.7, is how flow is created\nthrough the application of lean practices. Once flow is established, it must\nbe measured by the process team so that interruptions to flow (gaps from\nstandard) are quickly discovered and addressed.\nDeliver Value\nBatch Size Reduction\nProduction Cells\nPoint-of-Use Inventory\nPerformance Measures\nTPM\nSingle-Piece Flow\nBalanced Work\nStandardized Work\nVisual Factory\nContinuous Improvement\nQuick Changeover\nKanban / Pull Systems\nQuality at Source\n5-S\nLevel Scheduling\nMeet Takt Time\nFIGURE 3.5\nLean Tools and Methods\nLean is the Strategy\n• 25\nWelding Assembly Shipping WIP WIP FG Process 1\nWork\nOrder\nWork\nOrder\nWork\nOrder\nWork\nOrder\nMachine\nRM Shop\nReceiving\nInspection\nSupplier Customer\nScheduling\n/MRP\nPurchase Order Order\nDemand History\nPurchasing\n2 1\n3\n4 4 4 4\nTraditional manufacturing PUSH methodology: each department executes its plan\n1.

Every value stream has a bottleneck – i.e. the process step with the longest cycle time – and this is the only step which\nneeds to be scheduled. Welding is the bottleneck process in this value stream.\n3. A supermarket is created between Machining and Welding to regulate the work of Machining, so it matches the rate of work\nin Welding. Machining will replenish this supermarket at the rate that Welding pulls.\n4. A pull system is established between Machining and suppliers. Machining signals suppliers when its inventory needs to be\nreplenished. The supplier delivers at regular intervals.\n5. Because Assembly works faster than Welding, it produces one-at-a-time as Welding completes its work. Then the finished\nproduct flows directly to Shipping for delivery to the customer.\nThe result: Dramatic reduction of inventory.\nFIGURE 3.7\nFuture State Value Stream Map\nnewgenrtpdf\nLean is the Strategy • 27\nTraditional management accounting systems usually are aligned to\nthe monthly financial reporting cycle and are designed primarily to analyze costs. Lean management accounting systems must be aligned with,\nand support, lean operating practices. This means it must deliver timely\ninformation to measure and manage flow. It must provide timely information for daily and weekly lean management cycles. Lean management\naccounting systems must also supply the relevant and reliable information\nfor value stream mapping and improvement events.\nTHE ECONOMICS OF LEAN\nBusiness strategies are designed to drive financial success, and lean is no\ndifferent. What is different with a lean business strategy is that financial\nimprovement is a long-term outcome of serving customers better and\neliminating waste through continuous improvement. It takes time for\nemployees to learn how to solve problems and conduct improvement\nevents. It takes time to install and use all of the lean operational tools,\npractices and methods to improve flow. These are the reasons lean companies take a long-term view of financial improvement.\nI call this the economics of lean, which is summarized in Figure 3.8.\nContinuous improvement eliminates waste, which creates capacity. In the\nshort term, the creation of capacity does not have an immediate financial\nimpact. It’s how this newly created capacity is used that determines the\nfinancial impact.\nUsing capacity to serve customers better, such as by reducing lead times\nand improving delivery, has the potential to create a competitive advantage\nfor a company. This can lead to sales growth above and beyond a company’s\nhistorical growth rate. While CFO at Bullard I learned this firsthand.\nWe were able to reduce order fulfillment lead time to three days (while\nreducing inventory) and achieve over 95% on-time delivery. By serving\ncustomers better than the competition, this increased our sales growth rate\nfrom single digits to double digits.\nUsing capacity to improve flow also generates productivity gains, which\nmeans a value stream can increase its output with the same or fewer\nresources. Improving productivity controls costs by achieving some actual\n28 • Lean is the Strategy\ncost savings but more significantly by avoiding future cost increases, such\nas hiring more people or buying more machines.\nA lean management accounting system’s analytical and decision-making\npractices must be based on the economics of lean in order to realize the\nfinancial improvement that can result from continuous improvement.\nWRAP UP – LEAN IS THE STRATEGY\nThe foundations for an effective lean management accounting system,\nleadership and lean thinking have now been built. The next step is to build\nthe support structure, the numbers of a lean management accounting\nsystem, that will provide the relevant and reliable information to users.\nThis is known as the box score and Chapters 4, 5 and 6 will explain the\ncomponents of a box score.\nContinuous\nimprovement\nCreate\ncapacity\nUse capacity\nto deliver\nvalue\nUse capacity\nto achieve\ncost\nreduction\nFinancial\nimprovement\nFIGURE 3.8\nEconomics of Lean\nLean is the Strategy • 29\nUnderstandable\nUseful\nTimely\nVerifiable\nValid\nLean Thinking\nLeadership\nQuality Decision Making\nRelevant information Reliable information\nFIGURE 3.9\nArchitecture of a Lean Management Accounting System\n\nDOI: 10.4324/9781003304098-4 31\n4\nLean Performance Measurements\nIn this chapter I am going to explain a basic set of lean performance\nmeasurements, which can be used in any lean company. The chapter will\ncover what to measure, how to calculate the measures and how to develop\nan integrated set of lean performance measurements for a lean company.\nLater in Chapters 7 and 8 I will explain how these measurements are used\nin combination with lean practices to control, improve, manage and plan\nvalue streams.\nOne of my earliest “lean lessons” as a CFO was understanding the\nimportance of lean performance measurements in a lean company. Prior\nto Bullard’s lean transformation, we were very traditional when it came to\nmeasuring manufacturing operations. We used variances and absorption\nas our primary operational measurements for both individual jobs and\noverall operational performance.\nOur lean transformation began by hiring a vice president of manufacturing with lean experience, who then hired a team of experienced lean\noperational managers. One of their first initiatives was to meet with\naccounting to discuss performance measurements. In a very professional\nway, they clearly explained to us that they would not be using any variances\nor absorption numbers as performance measurements. They explained\nthat those measures would not tell them if their improvement goals of\nreducing lead times and improving quality, delivery and productivity\nwere being achieved. They then asked accounting to partner with them\nto develop new lean performance measurements because they knew that\nhaving accounting’s involvement would endorse that the measures were\nobjective, accurate and useful.\n32 • Lean Performance Measurements\nHere is what I learned about lean performance measurements from that\nexperience:\n• They need to measure real-time process performance.\n• The right combination of measures simultaneously measures if a process is delivering value and reveals the waste that is preventing value\nfrom being delivered.\n• They need to be simple and easy to calculate for the users.\n• They need to be reported based on lean management cycles, not\naccounting reporting periods.\n• They are useful to understand the relationships between lean operating performance and financial performance.\nLean performance measurements became an essential tool in Bullard’s lean\nmanagement accounting system. They were used by operations, accounting\nand senior leadership to learn more about how processes operated, to identify opportunities for improvement and to help everyone better understand\nhow lean operating performance could be leveraged to create financial\nsuccess.\nLEAN PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT CYCLES\nOne aspect that distinguishes lean performance measurements from traditional metrics is that they are designed to reveal problems. This means\nthat the frequency of measuring should be based on how fast a process\nneeds to recognize a problem, how fast it must respond to the problem and\nhow long it takes for adjustments to be reflected in process performance.\nFigure 4.1 summarizes the relationships between the three typical measurement cycles, which we will now look at in detail.\nDaily lean performance measurements are designed for cell work teams\nto measure if the cell is meeting operating performance standards and identify gaps from the standards. Daily measurements are analogous to warning\nlights on the dashboard of an automobile – if a warning light comes on, the\ndriver must take some action. In the case of daily lean measurements, cell\nteams must respond when there is a gap from standard by taking corrective\naction to eliminate the gap.\nLean Performance Measurements • 33\nCell teams respond to gaps from standard in these ways:\n• Troubleshooting – as gaps arise, standard responses are enabled to\nprovide short-term countermeasures to deal with the specific issue.\n• Just Do It improvements – for recurring problems and issues, teams\nemploy PDCA to enable improvements.\nIn some processes, the speed with which a team must respond to gaps\nmay require more frequent measurement, which would mean creating an\nhourly standard. Measuring hourly is called “day by the hour.” In other\nprocesses, such as software development, a cell team may have more time\nto respond to gaps, which would mean creating a weekly standard, but\nchecking daily. This is known as “week by the day.”\nWeekly lean performance measurements are designed for value stream\nteams to measure overall value stream performance against improvement\ntargets – achieving a new standard of performance. Weekly lean performance measurements answer the question: “Is the value stream making progress towards an improved future state?” If weekly measurements are not\ntrending in the right direction, value stream teams must make the necessary adjustments to their improvement activities.\nMonthly lean performance measurements are typically used at the company or division level by management teams to assess the overall lean strategy\nand associated initiatives. Monthly lean performance measurements indicate to senior leaders if progress is being made towards strategic objectives,\nwhich are usually established in the annual strategy deployment process.\nCategory Daily measures Weekly measures Monthly measures\nLevel Cell or process Value stream Company/division/business\nunit\nPurpose Meet performance standards Measure improvement Assess strategic initiatives\nOwners/users Cell or process teams Value stream teams Senior leadership team\n“Check & adjust” Daily huddle Weekly meeting Monthly meeting\nNumber of measures 3 - 5 5 - 7 5 - 7\nImprovement Just-do-its Kaizen and value stream\nimprovements\nStrategy deployment\nimprovement initiatives\nFIGURE 4.1\nLean Performance Measurement Cycles\n34 • Lean Performance Measurements\nIf monthly measurements are not trending in the right direction, management teams will make the necessary adjustments to initiatives and tactics.\nThese relationships are guidelines, and not hard fast rules. For example, in\na process where the production cycle time is long, such as software development or building complex machinery, daily measurements to identify gaps\nfrom standards may be too frequent, and it may be more logical to measure\ngaps from standards on a weekly basis. A general rule of thumb is the shorter\nthe total cycle time of the process, the more frequently it should be measured.\nNow let’s look at specifically what aspects of process performance should\nbe measured.\nWHAT TO MEASURE\nAs mentioned earlier, the right combination of lean performance\nmeasurements can give a complete picture of lean process performance.\nWhat’s great about lean performance measurements is that you can get a\npretty complete picture using five to seven measurements in most cases.\nFigure 4.2 lists the seven categories of process performance that lean companies strive to achieve.\nCategory Purpose of measuring\nDelivery Meet customers’ delivery expectations\nQuality Meet customers’ quality expectations\nLead time/Flow Flow through a process as fast as possible\nProductivity Increase output of a process with same\nresources\nCost\nReduce costs over time\nSafety Safe workplace\nMorale/Respect for people People are our most important asset\nFIGURE 4.2\nLean Performance Measurement Categories\nLean Performance Measurements • 35\nPerformance measurements related to delivery, quality and lead time\nshould be based solely on customer expectations, not the capabilities of a\nprocess. Focusing these measures on customer expectations will reveal the\nright problems to solve to improve delivering value to customers.\nPerformance measurements related to productivity, cost, and lead time\n(again) should focus on stretch improvement goals over time, which reveal\nthe waste to eliminate through continuous improvement.\nPerformance measurements related to safety, morale and respect for\npeople are based on the fact that lean companies recognize that a stable,\nskilled and educated workforce is the key to a successful lean transformation.\nNow let’s look at specific daily, weekly and monthly performance\nmeasures and how to calculate them.\nDAILY OR CELL LEAN PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENTS\nFigure 4.3 summarizes the typical daily lean performance measurements\nwhich can be applied to any work cell, in any process. Using Figure 4.3 as\na guide, let’s review some typical daily lean performance measurements in\ndetail.\nCategory Typical Measure Formula\nDelivery Schedule attainment • Actual work completed / planned work\nQuality Defect rate • Defective items / total items\nLead time/Flow Schedule attainment\nWork in process flow • Actual cell inventory / planned cell\ninventory\nProductivity Schedule attainment\nCost Drivers of costs • Overtime hours / total hours\n• Average changeover time\n• Operational equipment effectiveness\nSafety Incident rate • Safety cross\nRespect for people Morale • Cross training/skill matrix\n• Problems solved per person\n• Daily morale check\nFIGURE 4.3\nDaily Lean Performance Measurements for Cells\n36 • Lean Performance Measurements\nSchedule Attainment\nLean companies strive to be make-to-order, which means producing\nto specific customer demand. Schedule attainment is simply a discrete\nmeasure to determine if a cell produced to plan. The planned work can\nbe tangible products completed or on-time delivery of services. In cases\nwhere the cycle time of a cell to complete a product or service is longer\nthan a day (such as software development), the planned work can be based\non specific progress that needs to be made daily.\nQuality\nMeasuring quality on a daily basis is necessary because lean companies\nstrive to prevent defects from being passed on to customers, which\ncan be the company’s customers or downstream processes from cells.\nThis is done by building in “quality-at-the-source” into cell activities,\nwhich is the ability for employees to identify defects as fast as possible\nin order to:\n1. Build short-term “stop and fix” countermeasures to prevent defects\nfrom being passed on to subsequent cells.\n2. Identify the root causes of defects to make improvements to prevent\ndefects from occurring.\nCost\nA cell’s ability to control costs is based on its understanding of the operating practices that drive costs. Daily lean performance measurements of\ncost focus on the operational drivers of costs in work cells.\nFor example, if a cell team is working overtime, but the cell has been\nproperly staffed based on demand, it is important for the cell team to reveal\nthe operational reasons for overtime. Likewise in a machine-based cell, it\nmay be necessary to measure drivers such as downtime, changeover time\nor operational equipment effectiveness on a daily basis to reveal the drivers\nof costs.\nLean Performance Measurements • 37\nFlow\nPull systems are designed to have a standard level of work-in-process inventory to maintain flow. A daily measure of flow is designed for a cell team to\nmeasure gap from standard work-in-process inventory. This measure may\nnot necessarily mean counting cell work-in-process inventory frequently.\nIt could be a visual system that indicates when cell work-in-process inventory is greater or less than standard. If this occurs, it is a signal to the cell to\ntake the necessary corrective action. This measure is also known as WIPto-SWIP (actual work-in-process to standard work-in-process).\nHere are some examples. In a customer support function, the standard\nlevel of support tickets that are in process by any representative could be\nset at five. If actual tickets are less than five, it is a signal that more tickets\nneed to be pulled by the representative. If actual tickets are more than five,\nit is a signal that the representative may need help to close the tickets.\nSafety\nLean companies consider their employees to be their most important asset\nand they strive to achieve a safe work environment. The goal of measuring safety is that safety awareness becomes part of everyone’s everyday\nwork. Safety measures are usually based on specific incidents and also near\nmisses, which are clearly defined in a company’s safety program. A simple\ndaily performance measurement is what is sometimes known as a safety\ncross, which has 31 days in the shape of a cross. For each day where there\nare no incidents, that date is colored green, and if there is an incident, the\ndate is colored red.\nRespect for People\nLean companies recognize that high morale of employees is based on creating a culture where employees are engaged and satisfied coming to work\nevery day. There are a variety of measures that can be used to measure\nmorale in a cell. Developing employees’ skills through cross-training for\nthe various activities in the cell can increase morale. Tracking continuous\nimprovement participation rates or problems solved per person are other\npotential measures. It’s even possible to do a daily morale check with the\nteam by asking how they feel about their workday.\n38 • Lean Performance Measurements\nWEEKLY OR VALUE STREAM LEAN\nPERFORMANCE MEASUREMENTS\nFigure 4.4 summarizes the typical weekly lean performance measurements,\nwhich are deployed at the value stream (or administrative process) level\nto measure overall performance improvement towards a time-bound\nfuture state goal. Weekly review of value stream measurements will reveal\nif improvement activities are having a positive impact on driving the\nmeasures towards the future state goals. Weekly review of the measures by\nthe value stream team allows it to adjust improvement activities as needed.\nDelivery\nOn-time delivery is a common performance measurement in many companies, but it is typically measured based on a negotiated “promise date”\nrather than when the customer wants delivery of products or services. Lean\ncompanies measure on-time delivery against customer expectations, not\nnegotiated promise dates, because they want to reveal the true problems\nand issues preventing them from meeting customer expectations.\nCategory Typical Measure Formula\nDelivery On-time delivery to customer request date • Actual orders shipped or completed /\nplanned orders\nQuality Defect rate • Defective items / total items through\nvalue stream\n• Sum of cells’ first time through rates\nLead time/Flow Average lead time • Number of days (ship or completion\ndate) – order date\nMaterial flow • Days of inventory = annualized\nmaterial cost / average inventory\nProductivity Increase output with same resources • Sales / total hours worked\n• Value added progress / total hours\nworked\nCost Cost reduction over time • Cost(s) as a % of sales\n• Average actual cost per unit\nSafety Incident rate • Incidents per person\nRespect for people Morale • Improvement event participation rate\n• Training hours per person\nFIGURE 4.4\nWeekly Lean Performance Measurements for Value Streams\nLean Performance Measurements • 39\nIn the case of value streams with long production cycles, such as construction or software development, it may be necessary to modify the ontime delivery measure to “on-time progress.” Products and services with\nlong production cycles are typically managed like projects, broken down\ninto specific phases with due dates. On-time progress is simply measuring\nif specific weekly tasks have been completed according to the plan.\nQuality\nThe quality measure for a value stream is oftentimes called the “first\ntime through” rate. It measures how many units of work go through the\nvalue stream defect- and rework-free. The first time through rate can be\ncalculated from the daily defect rates of each cell in the value stream.\nFigure 4.5 illustrates how a value stream first time through rate can be\ncalculated in this manner.\nLead Time\nLean companies understand eliminating waste in a value stream will make\nthe value stream faster because the capacity being created can be applied to\nvalue added activities and orders are processed faster. Capacity also creates\nmore flexibility to adapt to unplanned changes in demand or for reacting\nto problems and issues as they arise.\nLead time is total processing time, which is the sum of value added\nactivity time plus non-value added activity time. Continuous improvement\nactivities reduce and eliminate non-value added activity time, which\nCell Defect rate First time through rate\nStep 1 5% 95% X\nStep 2 10% 90% X\nStep 3 10% 90% X\nStep 4 5% 95% X\nValue stream total = 73%\nFIGURE 4.5\nFirst Time Through Calculation\n40 • Lean Performance Measurements\nreduces lead times. For this reason, it is critical to measure lead times\nbecause it measures the effectiveness of improvement activities.\nThe lead time of any value stream or process is the average length of time\nfrom an order receipt date to the fulfillment date. Here are some examples:\n• In manufacturing, lead time is calculated based on order receipt date\nto shipment date.\n• In healthcare, lead time is typically measured as length of stay.\n• In a service business, such as a repair business, it would be measured\nfrom when the customer arrives to when the repairs are completed.\n• In an accounting firm it could be calculated based on when a client\ndelivers information for a tax return to when the tax return is\ncompleted.\nFlow\nIn companies that maintain an inventory of parts to produce (such as\nmanufacturing) or supplies to use (such as healthcare) it’s important to\nmeasure material flow using days of inventory. Lean companies that maintain inventory strive to minimize the number of days the inventory is in\nthe business through better purchasing practices, pull systems in production and other lean practices.\nProductivity\nProductivity is the essence of lean: increase output with the same (or fewer)\nresources. Output is increased by serving customers better. Resource utilization improves because more time is spent on serving customers and\nless time is spent on other activities. Productivity and lead time can be\nconsidered corollary performance measurements because measuring both\nhelps move each of them in the right direction.\nIn value streams, the typical productivity measure is sales divided by\ntotal hours worked. However, in some value streams that have long cycle\ntimes and in which sales are periodic (such as large equipment manufacturing, some professional services and construction) a substitute numerator can be value added progress. This numerator could be based on the\nspecific weekly tasks that have been completed.\nLean Performance Measurements • 41\nCost\nA lean strategy will have a positive impact on managing costs over time,\nbut not through conventional cost-cutting initiatives that non-lean companies employ. Rather, lean focuses on understanding the specific root\ncauses of costs and eliminate them over time.\n• Actual cost savings will be realized because improvement activities\nreduce wastes that have specific costs, such as reducing scrap by\nimproving quality.\n• The capacity created through improvement activities can be utilized\nand this will avoid future cost increases. A simple example is not\nhaving to hire additional employees to meet an increase in demand.\nRecommended lean performance measurements of cost that will consider\nboth methods of how lean reduces costs are:\n• Cost as a percentage of sales – over time, costs increase at a lower rate\nthan sales.\n• Contribution margin percentage – which will reflect improvements\nin variable costs.\n• Actual costs per unit – which will be reduced over time because costs\nincrease at a lower rate than the increase in units.\nA final note about lean performance measurements of cost. It usually takes\ntime to “move the measure” because it takes time to develop regular continuous improvement activities. Continuous improvement is based on\npeople studying and learning about processes, which takes time, and is also\nlimited because regular work also has to be done. It’s important to take a\nlong-term view of cost reduction and not fall into conventional short-term\nfinancial thinking of expecting to quickly see improved financial results.\nSafety and Respect for People\nThe specific measures illustrated in Figure 4.4 are similar to the daily lean\nperformance measures in terms of calculation. At the value stream level,\nwhat is different is developing improvement targets for these measures and\nthe initiatives that will move the measures towards the targets.\n42 • Lean Performance Measurements\nMONTHLY OR COMPANY LEAN\nPERFORMANCE MEASUREMENTS\nFigure 4.6 summarizes the typical monthly lean performance\nmeasurements, which are deployed at a company, division, or business\nunit level to measure its performance towards strategic lean-based goals.\nThese monthly measurements typically become part of monthly leadership\nmeetings and are used to measure the effectiveness and impact of strategic\ninitiatives. If progress is not being made towards the targets, that is an indication senior leaders may have to adjust initiatives and tactics.\nThe formulae for the measures listed in Figure 4.6 are very similar to the\nweekly value stream measures in Figure 4.4 that were explained earlier,\nwith a few exceptions which will now be explained.\nAt a company or division level, it is difficult to have a lean-based quality\nmeasure with short feedback loops to understand quality problems in\na timely manner. This is why lean companies focus measuring quality\nwhere the work gets done, at the cell and value stream level. However,\nif customers discovering quality problems is an issue for a company, an\neffective monthly quality performance measurement can be complaints,\nreturns or warranty claims, which can be used by senior leaders to assess\noverall quality initiatives.\nCategory Typical Measure Formula\nDelivery On-time delivery to customer request date • Actual orders shipped or completed/\nplanned orders\nQuality Defect rate • Customer complaint rate\n• Warranty or return rate\nLead time/Flow Average lead time • Number of days (ship or completion\ndate) – order date\nMaterial flow • Days of inventory = annualized\nmaterial cost / average inventory\nProductivity Increase output with same resources • Sales / number of employees\nCost Cost reduction over time • Cost(s) as a % of sales\n• Actual gross margin %\nSafety Incident rate • Incidents per person\nRespect for people Morale • Improvement event participation rate\n• Training hours per person\n• Retention rate\nFIGURE 4.6\nMonthly Lean Performance Measurements for the Company\nLean Performance Measurements • 43\nThe recommended measure of productivity on a monthly basis is sales\nper employee, based on the total number of employees in the company.\nThis is an effective measurement to assess the overall impact of lean in both\noperations and administrative functions.\nNow let’s look at how to create an integrated set of lean performance\nmeasurements at all three levels of measurements and how to align them\nwith the company’s lean strategy and actions.\nTHE LINKAGE CHART PROCESS\nA Linkage Chart is developed through a standard process following the\nPDCA cycle. The goal of the process is to develop an integrated set of lean\nperformance measurements that are aligned with a lean strategy, effective\nin identifying problems, and drive improvement. The steps the process\ngenerally follows are:\n• Develop the Linkage Chart and do initial calculation of the\nmeasurements (Plan).\n• Pilot using the measures (Do).\n• Review the effectiveness of the measurements (Check).\n• Replace ineffective measurements and/or end pilot (Adjust).\nDevelop the Linkage Chart\nA cross-functional team should create the Linkage Chart. The team should\nconsist of the users of the measurements – senior leaders for monthly\nmeasurements, value stream managers for weekly measurements and cell\nleaders for daily measurements. I highly recommend developing a Linkage\nChart using a kaizen event approach (one or two days) where the team\ndedicates the time to complete its development.\nFigure 4.7 illustrates a Linkage Chart for a manufacturing company and\nFigure 4.8 illustrates one for a service company. Using these figures as a\nguide, the Linkage Chart is developed from left to right. Identify goals and\ncandidate measurements for monthly measurements and link them using\narrows. Next, do the same for the weekly measurements with the added\n44 • Lean Performance Measurements VALUE STREAM MEASUREMENTS Sales per Hours Worked On-Time Delivery Inventory Days First Time Through Average Cost per Unit\nAverage Lead\nTime\nImprovements\nper Person\nCross-Training\nper Person\nIncident Rate\nCELL\nMEASUREMENTS\nSchedule\nAttainment\nMaintain\nKanbans\nFirst Time\nThrough\nOperational\nEquipment\nEffectiveness\nTrack\nImprovement\nProjects\n5S Audit\nCross-Training\nChart\nSafety Cross\nCELL GOALS\nBuild to Schedule\nQuality at Source\nSingle Piece Flow\nEliminate\nVariability\nEffective Visual\nManagement\nWidespread\nCross-Training\nSafety\nCELL CRITICAL\nSUCCESS FACTORS\nEliminate\nObstacles to\nFlow\nUse Standardized\nWork\nMake Products\non Time\nEffective Visual\nPull Systems\nQuick\nChangeover\nQuality at Source\nIncrease CI\nProject\nInvolvement\nIncrease Training\n& Cross-Training\nEnhance\nStandard Safety\nProcedures\nServe Customers\nBetter\nImprove\nProductivity\nContinuously\nImprove all\nProcesses\nRespect for\nPeople\nSTRATEGIES\nSales Growth\nSTRATEGIC\nMEASUREMENTS\nIncrease Output\nwith Same\nResources\nVALUE STREAM\nGOALS\nAverage Lead\nTime\nInventory Days\nOn-Time Delivery\nSales per\nEmployee\nActual Gross\nMargin %\n% People\nEngaged in\nImprovement\nSafety\nReduce Lead\nTimes\nImprove Material\nFlow\nPerfect Quality\nImprove\nProductivity\nCost Reduction\nover Time\nIncrease\nParticipation\nProvide\nAdvancement for\nEmployees\nEliminate\nAccidents &\nInjuries\nOvertime Hour %\nFIGURE 4.7\nLinkage Chart for Manufacturing\nnewgenrtpdf\nLean Performance Measurements • 45\nVALUE STREAM\nMEASUREMENTS\nSales per Hours\nWorked\nOn-Time Delivery\nImprovement\nEvent Hours per\nPerson\nFirst Time\nThrough\nAverage Cost per\nService\nAverage Lead\nTime\nTraining Hours\nper Person\nCross-Training\nper Person\nIncident Rate\nCELL\nMEASUREMENTS\nSchedule\nAttainment\nAverage\nTurnaround Time\nDefect Rate\nReduce Waiting\nTime\nTrack\nImprovement\nProjects\n5S Audit\nCross-Training\nChart\nSafety Cross\nCELL GOALS\nImprove Flow\nImprove Quality\nReduce\nTurnaround Time\nEliminate\nVariability\nEffective Visual\nManagement\nWidespread\nCross-Training\nSafety\nCELL CRITICAL\nSUCCESS FACTORS\nEliminate\nObstacles to\nFlow\nUse Standardized\nWork\nDeliver Services\non Time\nEffective Visual\nPull Systems\nQuick\nChangeover\nQuality at Source\nIncrease CI\nProject\nInvolvement\nIncrease Training\nMaintain a Safe\nWorkplace\nServe Customers\nBetter\nImprove\nProductivity\nContinuously\nImprove all\nProcesses\nRespect for\nPeople\nSTRATEGIES\nSales Growth\nSTRATEGIC\nMEASUREMENTS\nIncrease Output\nwith Same\nResources\nVALUE STREAM\nGOALS\nAverage Lead\nTime\nImprovements\nper Person\nOn-Time Delivery\nSales per\nEmployee\nLabor Cost as a %\nof Sales\n% People\nEngaged in\nImprovement\nSafety\nReduce Lead\nTimes\nContinuously\nImprove\nProcesses\nPerfect Quality\nImprove\nProductivity\nCost Reduction\nover Time\nIncrease\nParticipation\nProvide\nAdvancement for\nEmployees\nEliminate\nAccidents &\nInjuries\nOvertime Hour %\nFIGURE 4.8\nLinkage Chart for Service\nnewgenrtpdf\n46 • Lean Performance Measurements\nstep of linking the monthly measurements to the weekly goals. Finally, do\nthe same for the daily measurements.\nAfter the Linkage Chart is completed, the next step for the team is to do an\ninitial calculation of each measurement, as illustrated in Figure 4.9 (Linkage\nChart Event Phase). Each measurement must be specifically defined, then\ndetermine how the measure will be calculated and the source of the data.\nThe goal of this exercise is to determine if each measure is simple and easy to\ngather and calculate. Typically, the team will find that some of the measures\nmay need to be adjusted to make them simpler and easier.\nUSE POST-IT NOTES!\nMake the Linkage Chart visible by using Post-It Notes on paper hung\non a wall because as the team develops the chart changes will be made.\nAlso draw the linking arrows in pencil in case they need to be changed.\nAfter the Linkage Chart is completed, it can be converted into a more\nformal-looking document using Excel or another application.\nPilot the Measurements\nThe next step is to have the owners of the measures pilot the actual use of\nthe measurements, as illustrated in Figure 4.9 (pilot phase). Think of the\npilot phase as “practice” by incorporating the measures into daily, weekly\nand monthly management cycles to determine if they are truly effective in\nrevealing the root causes of both good and poor performance. The more\nfrequent the reporting of the measures, the shorter the pilot phase. Here\nare some pilot time recommendations:\n• Daily measurements for about one month in a few cells.\n• Weekly measurements for 4–6 weeks in one or two value streams.\n• Monthly measurements for 3–6 months in monthly senior leadership\nmeetings.\nReview and Adjust the Measurements\nReviewing the effectiveness of the measurements is ongoing through the\npilot phase. Besides their effectiveness in identifying the root causes of performance, the following aspects should also be reviewed:\nLean Performance Measurements\n• 47\nDefine the\nmeasure\n•Lead time =\ndays from\norder receipt\ndate to\nshipment date\nDevelop\nequation\n•Rolling 3-\nmonth\naverage\nDetermine\nsource of data\n•Custom\nreport from\nsystem\nDetermine\nfrequency\n•Weekly\nVisual\npresentation\n•Numbers\nand/or graph\nResponsibility\n•Who is\nresponsible for\nrecording &\nreporting?\nAccountability\n•Is measurement\neffective for\nPDCA?\nLinkage Chart Event Pilot Phase\nFIGURE 4.9\nSteps to Develop Effective Lean Performance Measurements\nnewgenrtpdf\n48 • Lean Performance Measurements\n• Ownership – have teams assumed ownership of the measurements?\n• Relevance – are the measures relevant to both the lean strategy and\nthe process being measured?\n• Alignment – are the measures aligned with lean operating practices\nand improvement activities?\n• Rationalization – are there other existing measures being used which\nshould not be used any longer? The purpose of a Linkage Chart is\nto rationalize the performance measurement system, not add more\nmeasures!\nPerformance measurements deemed ineffective may have to be modified\nor possibly be replaced. Expect to encounter this during the pilot phase.\nLinkage Chart Development Plan\nLinkage Charts can be developed for every value stream and administrative function in the company.

It’s best to develop Linkage Charts as lean\npractices are being introduced into each process in the business. Early\nintroduction of lean performance measurements in a lean transformation\nhelps employees understand their intended use – to be integrated with lean\npractices and used to understand process performance, identify problems\nand measure improvement.\nWRAP UP – LEAN PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENTS\nLean performance measurements have been around as long as lean thinking\nhas been around! Read any book about lean and there will probably be\nsome discussion about performance measurements. What’s important to\nunderstand from a lean management accounting system perspective is that\nthese measurements are an integral component of the system and their use,\nin combination with lean practices, will control, improve, plan and manage\nvalue streams. The application and use of lean performance measurements\nare covered in Chapters 7 and 8.\nNext let’s look at the next component of a box score, capacity.\nDOI: 10.4324/9781003304098-5 51\n5\nMeasuring Capacity\nTIME IS MONEY\n“Time is money” is an expression we’ve all heard or used many times. It\nmeans “don’t squander or waste time because it’s a valuable resource that\nneeds to be spent wisely.” In lean companies, this is how lean leaders view\ntime, as a valuable resource. Their focus is on getting all employees to spend\nmore time serving customers better and less time on everything else. This\nmeans that in order to support lean, a lean management accounting system\nneeds to measure time accordingly. This is called measuring capacity.\nI consider measuring capacity one of the most vital components of a\nlean management accounting system. That is because it helps establish the\ntrue cause–effect relationships between lean operating performance and\nfinancial performance. How a company spends its time goes a long way\ntowards determining how much money it will make. Aligning measuring\ncapacity with lean requires new numbers, based on how lean companies\nview the use of time. Any work activity either adds value or it does not.\nWhile this view may seem stark, and very “black or white,” it serves the\npurpose of getting people to think differently about their work activities\nand seek opportunities to improve.\nI have found the best way to learn how to measure capacity for a lean\nmanagement accounting system is to see how it is calculated. But before\nwe get to the actual number crunching, let’s review the economics of lean\nand take a deeper dive into how lean companies categorize work activities.\n52 • Measuring Capacity\nTHE ECONOMICS OF LEAN\nFigure 5.1 illustrates the economics of lean and the relationships between\ncapacity and financial performance. The primary outcome of continuous\nimprovement is eliminating waste, which means it creates capacity. In other\nwords, employees have more capacity to do more or other work because\nthey are not performing wasteful activities.\nLABOR IS AN ASSET!\nIn financial accounting, an asset is defined as a resource with economic\nvalue that a company owns or controls with the expectation that it will\nprovide a future benefit. Assets such as equipment or buildings meet\nthis definition and are capitalized on the balance sheet. Yet the cost\nof employees is recorded as an expense on the income statement even\nthough employees also meet the definition of an asset. Even though financial accounting standards cannot be changed, you can change thinking\ninside your company with a lean management accounting system.\nContinuously\nimprove\nCreate\ncapacity\nUse capacity\nto deliver\nvalue\nUse capacity\nto achieve\ncost\nreduction\nSustainable\nfinancial\nsuccess\nFIGURE 5.1\nEconomics of Lean\nMeasuring Capacity • 53\nThe financial impact of continuous improvement is based upon how\nthis freed-up capacity is used. If available capacity is used to create value\nfor customers, such as shorter lead times and higher on-time delivery,\nthis can have a positive impact on sales. In many lean companies, the\napplication of available capacity to create value also creates a competitive\nadvantage.\nAvailable capacity can also be used to achieve long-term cost reduction.\nFor example, enough capacity may be created over time to reduce overtime, which reduces costs. Available capacity can also be used to avoid\ncosts, such as not having to buy additional equipment or hire additional\npeople.\nHere is how I learned firsthand about the economics of lean and that\n“time is money,” as CFO of Bullard.\nBefore embarking on a lean transformation, Bullard was profitable and\nhad steady growth, but order fulfillment lead times were inconsistently\nlong, and on-time delivery was not up to customer expectations. When we\nembarked on our lean transformation, we set three goals:\n• ship every order in three days or less;\n• on-time delivery 95% or better;\n• eliminate finished goods inventory.\nThese were daunting goals, which seemed impossible to reach based on\nwhere we were and how our processes performed. It took us about three\nyears, but after having improvement events focused on establishing maketo-order pull systems, improving quality and reducing changeover times,\nwe achieved all three goals. Our financial performance was something we\nnever dreamed of:\n• Sales, which previously grew 5–7% annually, now were growing over\n20% because we had the shortest lead times and highest on-time\ndelivery in the industry.\n• The annual growth rate of costs, which was typically 4–6%, remained\nthe same.\n• Cash flow increased and Bullard paid off all debt.\n54 • Measuring Capacity\nTYPES OF ACTIVITIES\nEarlier I wrote that lean companies divide all activities into those that\nadd value and those that do not. Measuring capacity in lean management\naccounting is based on being able to identify activities as either value added\nor non-value added. Every activity in a process, whether it be a complete\nprocess step or tasks within process steps, can be categorized into one of\nthree types of activities – value added; and two types of non-value added\nactivities: non-value added but necessary or non-value added and wasteful\nactivities. Here is how to identify each type of activity.\nValue Added Activities\nValue added activities are those which must be performed to deliver a tangible product or an intangible product (such as information) or to complete a service. Value added activities must be performed to meet customer\nrequirements. In manufacturing this is usually called the cycle time to\nproduce a product. In service businesses, it is the direct interaction between\nan employee and a customer. In administrative functions, it is the required\nactivities to transform information to generate the output. Not performing\na value added activity directly impacts the quality of the product or service\ndelivered to the customer.\nNon-Value Added but Necessary Activities\nThese activities don’t create value for the customer but must be performed\nfor a specific business reason. Another way to think of non-value added\nbut necessary activities is that they are required activities which must be\nperformed to support the company or processes. Here are some examples.\nIn healthcare, there are many activities which must occur for regulatory\nreasons, such as providers ordering services in a specific manner to treat\npatients. In manufacturing, raw materials must be purchased to be used by\nvalue streams. In all companies, there is a process to follow when hiring\nemployees.\nNon-value added but necessary activities cannot be eliminated, but how\nthey are performed can be improved upon because waste may exist in how\nthey are performed. Lean companies strive to “lean out” non-value added\nbut necessary activities.\nMeasuring Capacity • 55\nNon-Value Added and Wasteful Activities\nThese activities are known in lean as the eight types of waste – defects,\noverproduction, waiting time, neglect of talent, transportation, inventory,\nmotion, and excess processing. These activities can be eliminated with no\nimpact on serving customers or meeting business requirements.\nFigure 5.2 summarizes the relationship between measures of capacity\nand activities. Measuring capacity in this manner aligns with the economics of lean and gives users the ability to measure both the short-term\nand long-term impacts of lean in box scores. In the short term, the impact\nof improvement activities that create capacity can be measured. In the long\nterm, the financial impact of how the available capacity is utilized can be\nmeasured in a box score.\nUnderstanding the differences between value added and non-value\nadded activities is necessary when collecting the data to do the calculation\nof capacity.\nPROCESS ANALYSIS AND DATA COLLECTION\nIn order to calculate capacity, data on the value added and non-value\nadded activities must be collected. If value stream maps or process maps\nhave been prepared in a standard manner with data boxes, as illustrated\nin Figure 5.3, they usually contain much of the necessary information to\ncalculate capacity.\n• total time spent on value added\nactivities\nProductive\ncapacity\n• total time spent on all non-value added\nactivities: necessary activities and\nwasteful activities\nNon-productive\ncapacity\n• total time created through\ncontinuous improvement\nAvailable\ncapacity\nFIGURE 5.2\nCapacity and Activities\n56\n• Measuring Capacity\nQty = 30,000\nCycle Time = 70s\nBatch = 1500\nSet Up = 10,800s\nScrap = 10%\nRework = 20%\nDowntime = 15%\nInspection = 10%\nInsp Time = 120s\n# cells = 8\nCrew Size = 4\n# of people = 34\nShifts = 1\nQty = 15,000\nCycle Time =\n180s\nBatch = 600\nSet Up = 1200s\nScrap = 5%\nRework = 10%\nDowntime = 5%\nInspection = 100%\nInsp Time = 30s\n# cells = 5\nCrew Size = 1\n# of people = 10\nShifts = 2\nQty = 3,000\nCycle Time =\n210s\nBatch = 20\nSet Up = 600s\nScrap = 0%\nRework = 10%\nDowntime = 0%\nInspection = 100%\nInsp Time = 60s\n# cells = 2\nCrew Size = 5\n# of people = 10\nShifts = 1\nQty = 3,000\nCycle Time =\n120s\nBatch = 1\nSet Up = 0s\nScrap = 0%\nRework = 2%\nDowntime = 0%\nInspection = 0%\nInsp Time = 0s\n# cells = 1\nCrew Size = 1\n# of people = 1\nShifts = 1\nDATA BOXES\nCustomer\nKanban\nShipping\nS&OP\nDemand ForecastsPurchase Forecasts\nOrder\nSupplier\nWelding Assembly Assembly Shipping\n3,000\nper Month\nMachine\nShop Machine Shop\nFIGURE 5.3\nValue Stream Map with Data Boxes\nnewgenrtpdf\nMeasuring Capacity • 57\nIf value stream or process maps are not available, it’s necessary to collect\ndata through direct observation, a “lean time study.” Two questions arise\nwhen data must be collected:\n• How long do we need to observe?\n• How much data do we collect on the process steps?\nIdeally it would be good to collect 30 observations. But one must consider\nthe time and effort to get 30 observations. If processing times in a value\nstream are short, for example total processing time can be calculated in\nminutes, it’s relatively easy to get 30 observations. When processing times\nare longer, such as hours or days, it may be more practical to do fewer\nobservations.\nOBSERVE, DON’T ASK\nI highly recommend that the data collection process be completed\nthrough direct observation, rather than asking employees who work\nin the process what they think. Employees who work in the process\nmay not understand lean and lean views of activities. This means they\nmay confuse value added and non-value added activities when giving\nresponses. They may also respond by giving “best case” answers. Asking\npeople what they think will lead to biased responses.\nThe goal is to collect data on every process step, but that may be impractical for value streams with many process steps, where the time and effort\nto collect the data may outweigh the benefit. An alternative method to\ncollecting data on every process step is to collect data on the bottleneck\nprocess step(s). The definition of a bottleneck is the process step with the\nlongest value-added cycle time. Bottlenecks control the rate of flow for the\nentire value stream. For example, if the cycle time of the bottleneck step of\na value stream is 10 minutes, this means the value stream output is limited\nto 6 units per hour (60 minutes divided by 10 minutes).\nBecause bottlenecks control the rate of flow for a whole value stream, it is\npossible to calculate the capacity for the bottleneck process because its capacity controls the capacity of the entire value stream. Measuring capacity of\nbottlenecks can greatly reduce the data collection effort.\n58 • Measuring Capacity\nNow it’s time to do some number crunching and illustrate exactly how\ncapacity is measured by process activity and by position activity.\nDATA COLLECTION METHODS\nThe two methods to collect the required data to measure capacity are based\non the process activities or the position activities and are summarized in\nFigure 5.4. While Figure 5.4 makes a distinction between products and services, please remember these are guidelines not hard fast rules.\nData Collection on Process Activities\nThis is the recommended method to use for processes that produce tangible\nproducts where the process steps are standardized and must be performed\nin a specific sequence. Failure to perform the process steps in the required\nsequence means the product will not meet quality standards. Examples of\nwhen to use this method of data collection to calculate capacity are manufacturing value streams and testing laboratories.\nData Collection on Position Activities\nThis is the recommended method to use for processes that deliver services.\nWhen delivering services, there is a process which must be completed, but\nthe exact sequence of these activities may vary a bit based on the interaction with the customer. For example, nurses have a group of patients to\nData collection Output Process\nProcess step activities Tangible product Must be completed in a\nspecific sequence\nEmployee position activities Service performed Sequence completed based\non interaction with customer\nFIGURE 5.4\nData Collection Methods for Capacity\nMeasuring Capacity • 59\nserve at the same time and may have to adjust their work routines based on\ncurrent patient needs.\nIt’s also recommended to use this method of data collection for administrative processes based on the varied responsibilities of employees who\nwork in these processes. For example, in human resources, a team member\nmay work in the hiring process, the benefits management process and also\ndeal with employee questions during a typical day, all based on specific\ninteractions as they occur.\nLet’s now look at an example of each data collection method.\nExample: Measuring Capacity by Process Activities\nThe Provalve value stream produces a product family that consists of five\ndifferent products. The value stream consists of three steps – fabricating\nthe four components, machining the four components and assembling\nthe components into the final product. Fabricating work is done on eight\nmachines and each machine has an operator. Machining is done on five\nmachines, and each machine has an operator. The six employees in final\nassembly assemble the four component parts into the final products.\nThe value stream has a current state value stream map with data boxes\nand that data is going to be used to calculate capacity following these\nfive steps:\n1. Calculate total available time.\n2. Calculate value added time and productive capacity.\n3. Calculate non-value added time, waste time.\n4. Calculate non-value but necessary time and non-productive capacity.\n5. Calculate available capacity.\nNow let’s look at each step in detail, where I will explain some options and\nchoices that may have to be considered.\nStep 1: Calculate Total Available Time (Figure 5.5)\nThe first step in measuring capacity is to calculate total available time,\nwhich will serve as the denominator in calculating the capacity percentages.\nThis step includes an important decision point which is to determine the\nresource that performs the value added work in each process step. In\nthe case of the fabricating and machining operations, machines perform\n60 • Measuring Capacity\nthe value added work, while in assembly employees perform the value\nadded work.\nThe shift hours entered should be based on a standard shift. You have\nthe option of including average overtime hours here if you want. For the\nremaining information, use what is considered “current.”\nFigure 5.5 summarizes the calculation of 159,600 minutes total available\ntime, based on the number of resources and one eight-hour shift over 20\nworking days a month.\nStep 2: Calculate Value Added Time and Productive Capacity (Figure 5.6)\nThe total value added time is calculated by multiplying the cycle time per\nunit in each operation by the number of units produced. Value streams\ntypically produce a family of products, which can have variations in cycle\ntimes and units. If this is the case, you may have to consider using some\nsort of average for both inputs.\nA simple average of cycle time and units can be used in value streams\nthat have a small family of products. In value streams with a larger family\nof products, you may have to consider using a weighted average or use the\n80/20 rule, and average only the cycle times and units for the products that\ncontribute the majority of production volume.\nFigure 5.6 summarizes the calculation of the productive capacity of 40%\nfor the value stream as well as each of the three process steps.\nFabrication Machining Assembly Value Stream Total\nTotal available time\nResource performing work Machines Machines People\nNumber ofresources 8 5 6\nShift hours 8 8 8\nNumber ofshifts 1 1 1\nLunch and break time (minutes) 60 60 60\nDaysin the month 20 20 20\nTotal available time 67,200 42,000 50,400 159,600\nFIGURE 5.5\nCalculating Total Available Time\nValue added time Fabrication Machining Assembly Value Stream Total\nUnits shipped 8,000 8,000 2,000\nCycle time per unit 3 3 8\nTotal value added time 24,000 24,000 16,000 64,000\nProductive capacity % 36% 57% 32% 40%\nFIGURE 5.6\nCalculating Productive Capacity\nMeasuring Capacity • 61\nStep 3: Calculate Non-Value Added, Waste Time (Figure 5.7)\nA value stream mapping process quantifies certain types of waste such\nas defects, changeover times, downtime, overproduction and inspection\ntimes. This information can be used to calculate the non-value added,\nwasteful time for measuring capacity.\nThis information can be used to calculate capacity as follows:\n• Changeover time is the number of changeovers multiplied by the\ntime per changeover.\n• Overproduction time is the quantity overproduced multiplied by the\ncycle time.\n• Scrap and rework time is the scrap and rework quantity multiplied\nby the cycle time.\n• Inspection time is the number of units inspected multiplied by\ninspection time per unit.\n• Downtime is the total available time multiplied by the downtime\npercentage.\nFigure 5.7 summarizes the non-value added, waste time for the Provalve\nvalue stream, based on:\n• Changeover time in fabrication and machining.\n• Scrap in all three process steps.\nNon-productive, waste time Fabrication Machining Assembly Value Stream Total\nBatch size 30 10\nTotal partsmade 10,000 10,000 3,333\nNumber of changeovers 333 1,000\nTime per changeover 20 3\nTotal changeover time 6,667 3,000 9,667\nScrap rate 20% 20% 40%\nScrap quantity 2,000 2,000 1,333\nTotal scrap time 6,000 6,000 10,667 22,667\nPercentage of items inspected 25% 25% 50%\nTotal partsmade 10,000 10,000 3,333\nInspection time per unit 1 0.5 6\nTotal inspection time 2,500 1,250 10,000 13,750\nDowntime percentage 10% 10% 10%\nTotal available time 67,200 42,000 50,400\nTotal downtime 6,720 4,200 5,040 15,960\nFIGURE 5.7\nCalculating Non-Productive, Waste Time\n62 • Measuring Capacity\n• Quality inspection in all three process steps.\n• Downtime in all three process steps.\nStep 4: Calculate Non-Productive but Necessary Time\nand Non-Productive Capacity (Figure 5.8)\nThese types of activities must be specifically identified based on what are\nconsidered “necessary” business activities for any value stream. In the\nProvalve value stream there are two non-value added but necessary activities that occur each day: 15 minutes of 5-S activities and a 15-minute\ndaily huddle. While these activities occur, the machines in fabrication and\nassembly are not operating. It’s also possible to include improvement activities as part of non-value added but necessary activities. In the case of the\nProvalve value stream, each employee spends eight hours per month on\nvarious improvement events.\nFigure 5.8 summarizes the calculation of non-productive capacity for the\nProvalve value stream, which is the total of the non-value waste and necessary activity time. The value stream also separated continuous improvement capacity in their presentation.\nWhen presenting non-productive capacity, you have options.

Another option would be to show the capacity percentages for\nthe two types of non-productive activities separately.\nThe available capacity of the value stream, and each process step, is\ncalculated simply by subtracting the productive, non-productive and continuous improvement capacity percentages from 100%, as illustrated in\nFigure 5.9.\nThe Provalve capacity calculation provides insight into where to possibly focus future improvement efforts. Improving quality in all process\nsteps will reduce both scrap and inspection activities. Implementing\ntotal productive maintenance will reduce downtime in all process steps.\nExample: Measuring Capacity by Position Activities\nIn service value streams, there are standard activities which must be\ncompleted, but the exact sequence of these activities may vary a bit based\non the interaction with the customer. For capacity calculation purposes,\nit’s best to do direct process observation for data collection since it may be\ndifficult to draw a value stream map.\nFigure 5.10 summarizes the activities for a team of nurses in an inpatient\nwing of a small regional hospital. The value added activities are those\nthat contribute directly to the patients’ plans of care. The necessary activities are those which must be performed, but do not directly contribute\nto the patients’ plans of care. The non-productive activities are viewed as\nwaste and can be eliminated without impacting value added or necessary\nactivities.\nFabrication Machining Assembly Value Stream Total\nTotal available time 67,200 42,000 50,400 159,600\nTotal value added time 24,000 24,000 16,000 64,000\nProductive capacity % 36% 57% 32% 40%\nTotal non-productive time 26,687 17,450 29,307 73,444\nNon-productive capacity % 40% 42% 58% 46%\nContinuous improvement activities\nNumber of people 8 5 6\nTime per month per person (hours) 8 8 8\nContinuousimprovement time 3,840 2,400 2,880 9,120\nContinuousimprovement capacity % 6% 6% 6% 6%\nAVAILABLE CAPACITY % 19% -4% 4% 8%\nFIGURE 5.9\nCalculating Available Capacity\n64 • Measuring Capacity\nUsing the data from Figure 5.10, capacity for the team of nurses can\nbe calculated following the same five steps explained in the previous\nsection.\nStep 1: Calculate Total Available Time (Figure 5.11)\nThis team decided it would calculate capacity based on the first shift of a\nworkday. A team of four nurses work this eight-hour shift, and Figure 5.11\nsummarizes the calculation of total available time of 57,600 minutes\nper month. This will serve as the denominator to calculate the capacity\npercentages.\nStep 2: Calculate Value Added Time and Productive Capacity (Figure 5.12)\nDuring the process observation and data collection activities, three value\nadded activities were identified:\n1.

Calculating capacity reveals that nurses spend over 50%\nof their time on necessary and non-productive activities. Knowing this\ninformation, eliminating the non-productive activities and reducing the\nwaste in the necessary activities will create more capacity for nurses to\nspend time in direct patient care, which in healthcare is serving customers\nbetter.\nFREQUENCY OF MEASURING CAPACITY\nThe best way to think about measuring capacity is that it is the “average\ncapacity” based on the current operating practices. As such, it should be\nrecalculated periodically based on the continuous improvement activity\ncycle in a value stream.\nIf a company has a regular cycle of value stream mapping, capacity will\nbe initially measured based on the current state map. It can be re-measured\nduring the next scheduled mapping event using updated information\nfrom the “new” current state map. Another option, if improvement activities are regularly scheduled, would be to recalculate capacity quarterly or\nmonthly.\nThe purpose of re-calculating capacity is to keep the measurement up to\ndate for decision makers to make quality business decisions.\nCapacity Summary Minutes %\nTotal available 57,600 100%\nProductive capacity 20,250 35%\nNecessary capacity 18,750 33%\nNon-productive capacity 12,200 21%\nAvailable capacity 6,400 11%\nFIGURE 5.15\nCalculating Available Capacity\n68 • Measuring Capacity\nWRAP UP: TIME IS MONEY\nIt’s been my experience, working with lean companies, that those who\nmeasure capacity in their lean management accounting systems improve\nthe quality of their decision making. As stated in the introduction to this\nchapter, time is money, and the more wisely a company spends its time will\nhave a direct impact on how it spends its money and how much money\nit makes.\nAs a Lean CFO, it is important to understand that measuring capacity\nestablishes the true cause–effect relationships between lean operating\npractices and financial performance in a lean management accounting\nsystem. Developing a deep understanding of these relationships throughout\nthe company will drive financial improvement over time.\nNow let’s learn about value stream income statements, the final component of a box score.\nDOI: 10.4324/9781003304098-6 69\n6\nValue Stream Income Statements\nGAAP = GAAH!\nThis is a typical reaction of non-financial managers in companies when\nthey are given financial reports based on Generally Accepted Accounting\nPrinciples (GAAP), and they are expected to explain the financial results.\nThis reaction occurs for three primary reasons:\n1. Accounting principles exist to create common standards for external\nfinancial reporting, making it easier for readers of financial statements\nto understand company performance and make rational decisions about\ninvestments, loans or comparing companies’ financial performance.\n2. The reporting requirements of GAAP can mask actual financial performance because of specific adjustments accounting must make to\nmaintain compliance with GAAP.\n3. The principles are very technical and are just plain difficult to understand. Even experienced CFOs must occasionally consult with their\nCPA firms to help them understand how to maintain compliance\nwith GAAP.\nThe result? Many non-financial managers have a hard time explaining\nactual operating performance using GAAP-based financial reports. In\nlean companies, this problem is further exacerbated because GAAP-based\nfinancial reports are not modeled on the economics of lean and sometimes\n“show” that “lean is not working.” From a lean point of view, the difficulties\n70 • Value Stream Income Statements\nmanagers have in using GAAP-based financial reports are a problem of\npoor quality information, that must be solved. Value stream income\nstatements solve these problems.\nPURPOSE OF VALUE STREAM INCOME STATEMENTS\nA value stream income statement is an internal financial report designed\nspecifically for understanding the true cause–effect relationships between\nlean operating performance and financial performance. Value stream\nincome statements, when used in conjunction with lean performance\nmeasurements and capacity measurements, drive root cause analysis of the\noperational issues impacting financial performance.\nValue stream income statements are designed to meet the needs of\ndifferent internal users. Value stream teams or managers can use them\nto better understand the direct impact of value stream performance on\nthe sales and costs they control. Accounting and operations can use value\nstream income statements to better understand the level of improvement\nneeded to achieve financial goals. Decision makers can use value stream\nincome statements to accurately project the true financial impact of just\nabout every business decision.\nIn Chapters 7 and 8 I will explain in detail how value stream income\nstatements are used. This chapter will explain how to design value stream\nincome statements for your company.\nVALUE STREAMS ARE PROFIT CENTERS\nChapter 3 explained how lean companies organize, manage, improve and\ncontrol by value streams to serve customers better. Value streams flow horizontally through the traditional organizational structure, making them more\nimportant than departments, divisions or business units. From a financial\nviewpoint, it’s important to look at value streams as the profit centers of\nthe company. They generate the revenue by serving customers; they spend\nmoney and generate an operating profit. The expenses in any value stream are\ndirectly related to its lean operating performance and capacity requirements.\nValue Stream Income Statements • 71\nVALUE STREAM INCOME STATEMENT PRACTICES\nValue stream income statements must be designed with their users in\nmind. There is not a specific set of standards which must be met to create\na value stream income statement but rather a set of practices to follow. By\nfollowing these practices, a company can design and format value stream\nincome statements to meet the specific needs of all its users.\nPractice 1: Simple Format\nValue stream income statements should be easy to read for non-financial\nusers, using everyday language they understand, and also be based on\na rational, simple chart of accounts. For example, most users of value\nstream income statements don’t need to see five or six different labor\nexpense line items, where one would suffice. In other lean accounting\nbooks this simple format is referred to as “Plain-English financial\nstatements.” To simplify the format, consider it a continuous improvement event, which focuses on delivering what the customer wants. This\nis a simple improvement event – ask the users what level of detail they\nwould like to see.\nPractice 2: Report Actual\nValue stream income statements should always report actual sales and\nactual costs incurred for the reporting period. This is important to establish\nthe actual cause–effect relationships between lean operating performance\nand financial performance. Non-financial managers think about financial\nperformance with more like a “checkbook approach” than a “GAAP mentality.” They intuitively understand that sales are simply based on products\nshipped or services delivered, not revenue recognition practices. They also\nunderstand that actual costs are based on spending decisions and operating practices, not complex financial reporting adjustments.\nIt’s important to note here that the definition of “actual” should be based\non your method of accounting – accrual or cash. Simply report actual\ncosts based on how expenses are recorded in your general ledger through\naccounts payable, prepaid expense amortization or any other normal,\nregular accrual accounting methodology. Avoid using GAAP-based\n72 • Value Stream Income Statements\nadjustments non-financial managers would not understand, such as\naccruals for obsolete inventory.\nPractice 3: Properly Define Variable and Fixed Costs\nThe definition of fixed and variable costs is heavily influenced by financial reporting and analytical practices, which can make fixed costs look\nlike variable costs. One example is direct labor in manufacturing where\nproduct costing is used. In product costing, the direct labor cost of any\nproduct is based on how long it takes to make the product, which gives\nthe illusion that direct labor is a variable cost. Another example is any\ncost allocation methodology, such as calculating cost per patient in\nhealthcare or cost per customer served in a service business, where the\nallocation basis creates the impression that costs are variable.\nIn lean management accounting it is important to adopt simple and\nstandard definitions of variable and fixed costs when designing a value\nstream income statement. This is important because the proper classification of variable and fixed costs, based on how each cost actually behaves,\nwill improve analytical practices and decision making. Here are the\nrecommended definitions to use:\n• Variable costs – costs that vary in direct proportion to changes in\nshort-term sales volume.\n• Fixed costs – costs that do not change in direct proportion to changes\nin short-term sales volume and are influenced by management\ndecisions.\nPractice 4: Avoid Cost Allocations\nIn many companies, cost allocations are commonly used to assign costs to\nproducts, jobs, projects, customers and business units for analytical and\nreporting purposes. Any cost allocation method involves a level of subjectivity in assigning costs, which can be confusing to users. Examples of\ncost allocation methods are product costing, assigning corporate overhead to divisions, and creating artificial “charges” between departments or\ndivisions. In designing value stream income statements, it is best to avoid\nincluding cost allocations because the focus is on the relationship between\nactual costs and operating performance.\nValue Stream Income Statements • 73\nDESIGNING A VALUE STREAM INCOME STATEMENT\nNow let’s look at how to design a value stream income statement following\nthese practices. Figure 6.1 illustrates a typical format of a value stream\nincome statement and the following paragraphs will explain line-by-line\nValue Stream Income Statement\nYear to date\nSales 2,001,400\nDirect variable costs\nRaw materials 829,936\nSupplies 6,790\nOutside processing & services 60,043\nSales commissions 40,028\nContribution margin 1,064,603 53%\nDirect fixed costs\nLabor:\nSalaries and wages 176,890\nBenefits 26,534\nMachines & equipment:\nDepreciation 19,300\nRepairs & maintenance 9,750\nTooling 2,335\nOther direct fixed costs 12,000\nTotal direct fixed costs 246,809 12%\nValue stream operating margin 817,795 41%\nShared operating costs\nSupport labor 13,670\nShared production costs 27,540\nFacilities 40,250\nTotal shared operating costs 81,460 4%\nValue stream operating profit 736,335 37%\nFIGURE 6.1\nValue Stream Income Statement\n74 • Value Stream Income Statements\nthe logic behind this format, and the options companies have in designing\ntheir formats.\nSales\nBeing able to identify the sales or revenue for each value stream is fairly\nstraightforward because the process of identifying value streams is usually\nbased on products or services that have similar flow through the company.\nVariable Costs\nThe actual variable costs for any value stream are identified based on those\ncosts which vary in direct proportion to changes in sales. In manufacturing,\nraw material is a primary variable cost because it varies in direct proportion with every unit sold. In healthcare, the equivalent of raw materials is\ndrugs and supplies, which vary based on the number of patients seen. In\nrestaurants, it is food. In some service value streams, it can be parts and\nsupplies. Some companies even have included sales commissions as value\nstream variable costs. It’s possible in knowledge-based companies, such as\nsoftware development or professional services, that there may not be significant variable costs.\nIn companies that have inventory on their balance sheet and cost of\ngoods sold on their income statement, it will be necessary to define\n“actual material cost.” Cost of goods sold is based on financial accounting\nreporting requirements to comply with the matching principle in financial reporting, which simply means to show the costs associated with the\nrevenue recognized in a reporting period. This is typically accomplished\nthrough the use of a product costing system, where the cost of each product\nsold makes up cost of goods sold.\nThe lean management accounting perspective of material cost is\ndifferent. The objective is to show the actual cost of materials consumed\nor used by a value stream. A recommended approach for reporting actual\nmaterial cost is to report how much material entered into the value stream\nin a reporting period (cost of goods sold is how much exited) by showing\nmaterial purchases or material issued into the value stream from inventory.\nMaterial purchases can be used if two conditions exist. Raw material\ninventory levels are low, and the different types of raw material are unique\nto each value stream. In the case where raw material levels are high and/or\nValue Stream Income Statements • 75\nsimilar raw materials are used by multiple value streams, it is usually simpler to record raw material issued as actual.\nContribution Margin\nContribution margin is a common calculation in financial analysis and\nmay not be well understood by non-financial managers. It is the revenue\navailable after variable costs to cover fixed costs and provide a profit. In\nlean management accounting it is a very useful tool in decision making,\nwhich will be discussed in detail in Chapter 8.\nFixed Costs\nValue stream fixed costs are the actual costs that a value stream has direct\ncontrol over through its operating practices and the resources assigned to\nit. The primary fixed costs of most value streams are labor and machine/\nequipment costs. In any value stream people and/or machines are the\nresources that perform the value added work to produce a product or\ndeliver a service.\nIn lean management accounting, a way to look at labor and machine\ncosts is that these costs are how much a value stream is paying for a given\nlevel of capacity. This link between actual labor and machine cost and value\nstream capacity becomes very useful in business decision making and cost\nmanagement. This will be discussed in detail in Chapter 8.\nThe best method to determine actual labor and machine costs is using\nthe value stream organization. Labor cost for any value stream is based on\nthe actual employees assigned to that value stream, which includes managers, supervisors and any functional support. Labor cost includes salaries,\nwages and benefits.\nThe value stream organization also specifically identifies the machines\nand equipment in each value stream. The actual machine cost for any value\nstream can include depreciation, repair and maintenance, tooling and any\nother cost which can be directly charged to specific machines.\nThere may be other direct fixed costs for value streams. To determine\nwhich other fixed costs may be direct costs, here is the method I use when\nworking with companies in developing value stream income statements.\nI have a team of people from accounting and operations review all expense\nline items on the company income statement and understand what is being\n76 • Value Stream Income Statements\nposted to each expense. The team can then determine if an entire expense\nline item can be charged to one value stream or whether individual charges\nin an expense line item should be charged to different value streams.\nAnother beneficial outcome of this exercise is how much everyone learns\nabout what makes up each expense.\nValue Stream Operating Margin\nValue stream managers or teams have responsibility and accountability for\nvalue stream operating margin. They have direct control over generating\nrevenue by flowing orders through the value stream to customers. They\ncontrol their actual costs through their operating practices, capacity usage\nand improvement activities. Using box scores, value stream teams quickly\nlearn the relationships between lean performance measures, capacity usage\nand value stream margin.\nShared Costs\nDuring the process of identifying value streams, lean companies also identify shared resources, which can be thought of as “internal suppliers” of\nproducts or services to multiple value streams. Shared resources fall into\nthree categories. A shared resource can perform an operational process,\nsuch as a testing lab in a hospital or a production step in manufacturing\n(oftentimes these are called monuments). A shared resource can also provide a service, such as maintenance, engineering or quality. The final category of shared resources is a company’s physical plant, which houses the\nvalue streams and administrative functions. While a value stream does not\nhave direct control over its portion of shared costs, it can have an influence\non shared costs through its operating practices.\nFor decision-making purposes, companies can elect to assign a portion\nof shared costs on each value stream income statement. The first step in\nassigning shared costs is to gather the actual costs of the shared resources.\nThe second step is to assign shared costs to value streams by a simple,\nrepeatable method to get a reasonable representation of its use of shared\nresources. Here are some examples of simple, repeatable methods to assign\nshared costs.\nShared operational process costs can be assigned to value streams based\non a usage ratio of each value stream’s usage to the total output of the\nshared process. Because shared process steps are usually value added, the\nValue Stream Income Statements • 77\nincentive is not for value streams to use less of the shared process step, but\nfor operations to determine if it would be more cost-effective and serve\ncustomers better if these “monuments” were broken down and replicated\nin each value stream.\nSupport functions that provide services to all value streams are usually\nthe most difficult to assign to value streams because of having to determine\na simple method to apportion the costs. It’s important to avoid creating a\ncomplex system to track how much each value stream “uses” the support\nfunctions, such as time tracking.\nThe recommended approach would be for a small cross-functional team\nto use a PDCA problem-solving approach to develop a simple assignment\nmethod. The team can look at how each support function interacts with\nvalue streams in an attempt to come up with a simple assignment method.\nIf a simple assignment method cannot be developed, it may be best not to\nassign the shared costs.\nIt is common to assign facility costs to value streams based on the amount\nof physical space used by each value stream. A value stream can influence\ntotal facility costs by reducing its footprint and creating available space for\nnew business. In fact, one company I worked with a few years ago assigned\nits unused facility space to sales and marketing to incentivize them to grow\nthe business.\nOver the years in working with companies, I have seen different approaches\nto assigning shared costs to value streams. Some companies have used the\nmethods described above. Others decided not to assign shared costs to\nvalue streams but to show them separately as “support costs” on a company\nvalue stream income statement. Yet others have created their own simple\nmethods to assign shared costs. In determining how best to assign shared\ncosts in your company, keep the method simple and base it on the reasons\nwhy you want shared costs assigned to value streams.\nValue Stream Operating Profit\nThe primary reason for including shared costs on value stream income\nstatements is to get a more complete picture of value stream operating\nprofit for decision making. Improving value stream operating profit is\nmore cross-functional than improving value stream margin and usually\nis done by senior leaders or teams that represent value streams, support\nfunctions and finance.\n78 • Value Stream Income Statements\nNow let’s look at the next step in developing value stream income\nstatements, which is re-formatting a company’s income statement into a\nvalue stream format.\nDESIGNING A COMPANY VALUE STREAM\nINCOME STATEMENT\nOnce value stream income statements have been created for all value\nstreams, the next logical step is to re-format the company income statement\ninto a value stream format for internal analytical purposes. (Note: this does\nnot necessarily mean you are changing the format for external reporting\npurposes.)\nBuilding a company value stream income statement is not difficult\nonce individual value stream income statements have been developed.\nThe design process really boils down to deciding how to show the “rest of\nthe company expenses” and how to reconcile the company value stream\nincome statement to the externally reported profit. A sample companywide value stream income statement is illustrated in Figure 6.2 and the\nfollowing paragraphs will explain its development.\nThe company represented in Figure 6.2 has two value streams – OEM\nand Systems. In developing each of their value stream income statements,\nit was decided to call the actual labor for each value stream “direct labor,”\nwhich includes all employees in each value stream. The line item “support\nlabor” refers to the shared costs of operational support functions used by\nboth value streams. Another shared cost is facilities, which is assigned\nto each value stream, and other functions, based on the amount of space\neach uses.\nIn designing the company value stream income statement, the company\ndecided to make visible two other business functions, product development\nand sales and marketing, that made up the majority of non-value stream\ncosts. The expenses of all other business functions, such as accounting,\nhuman resources and information technology, are aggregated into general\nand administrative.\nThe horizontal format of this company value stream income statement\naligns with a value stream organization, especially for making visible how\nthe company operating profit (which is shown as “value stream profit”) of\nValue Stream Income Statements\n• 79\nOEM Value\nStream\nSystems Value\nStream\nNew Product\nDevelopment Sales & Marketing\nGeneral &\nAdministrative Total\nSales $ 1,039,440 $ 1,009,246 $ 2,048,686\nMaterials 424,763 339,810 84,953 849,526\nDirect Labor 189,336 123,648 312,984\nMachines 88,800 27,750 116,550\nOutside Processing 36,000 17,731 53,731\nSupport Labor 87,662 67,616 40,772 93,315 53,056 342,421\nFacilities 15,450 10,300 3,090 3,090 9,270 41,200\nOther Costs 1,933 2,899 483 2,416 1,933 9,664\nTotal Costs 843,944 589,754 129,298 98,821 64,259 1,726,076\nValue Stream Profit $ 195,496 $ 419,492 $ (129,298) $ (98,821) $ (64,259) $ 322,610\nReturn on Sales 19% 42% -6% -5% -3% 16%\nBeginning Inventory 1,186,035\nEnding Inventory 963,148\nChange in Inventory $ (222,887)\nProfit Before Tax $ 99,723\nReturn on Sales 5%\nFIGURE 6.2\nCompany Income Statement in Value Stream Format\nnewgenrtpdf\n80 • Value Stream Income Statements\n$322,610 was generated. It is now clear that the two order fulfillment value\nstreams must generate enough operating profit to “pay” for the other functional expenses of the business. This will become useful when calculating\nhurdle rates, which will be explained in Chapter 8.\nThe final step in developing a company value stream income statement\nis to segregate and make visible all “accounting adjustments” that are made\nfor external reporting purposes to arrive at the net profit reported on the\nfinancial statements. The company in Figure 6.2 is a manufacturing company, and it must adjust the inventory value on the balance sheet each\nmonth, which is shown on the inventory adjustment line.\nSegregating the accounting adjustments from operating profit makes visible the primary cause of the profit of $99,723. On this income statement,\nthe decrease in inventory of $222,887 negatively impacted a solid operating profit of $322,610.\nA company value stream income statement creates improved visibility\ninto overall company financial performance. Operating profit, based on\nactual revenue and actual costs, reveals the true financial performance of\nbusiness operations, and managers can be held responsible and accountable for improving operating profit. Segregating accounting adjustments\n“below the line” eliminates the confusion they cause for non-financial\nmanagers, who no longer have to try to explain something they don’t\nunderstand.\nWRAP UP\n“Change the physical to change the financials” is a phrase I often use when\nworking with companies to drive home the point that operational improvement must be the engine to drive financial improvement. This is why value\nstream income statements are an essential component of analysis and\ndecision making in lean companies. When combined with the other two\nbox score components – performance measurements and capacity – they\ncreate an analytical tool to learn about these cause–effect relationships, as\nillustrated in Figure 6.3.\n“It’s about spending, not costs” is the chapter title I used in the first\nedition of The Lean CFO for the chapter that explained value stream\nincome statements and value stream costing. That title is another way to\nValue Stream Income Statements • 81\nexplain how to use value stream income statements. Any cost that appears\non a financial statement is the result of a spending decision in a process,\nwhether it be hiring an employee, buying supplies, or operational practices.\nUnderstanding the root causes of spending and improving methods of\nspending will ultimately manage costs.\nChapters 4, 5 and 6 explained how to build a box score. Now it’s time\nto learn how to use box scores in lean companies in Chapters 7 and 8.\nChapter 7 explains how box scores are integrated with lean practices to\ncreate a value stream management system to plan, improve, control and\nmanage value streams. Chapter 8 explains how to incorporate box scores\ninto analysis and decision making as it relates to understanding the profitability of decisions.\nFIGURE 6.3\nDrivers of Financial Performance\n\nDOI: 10.4324/9781003304098-7 83\n7\nValue Stream Management\nINTRODUCTION\nValue stream management is the integration of lean management\naccounting with lean practices into a holistic management system. Value\nstream management is designed to serve customers better, improve productivity and improve financial performance.\nA value stream management system is deployed at the value stream or\nbusiness process level of a lean company and consists of the tools, practices\nand routines to control, improve, plan and manage any operational value\nstream or administrative business process. It can be deployed in any lean\ncompany, and in any type of industry.\nFigure 7.1 illustrates the value stream management system. Planning,\nknown as annual strategy deployment, is the engine that sets the improvement priorities for the company based on three to five initiatives that are\nexpected to be completed in a year. Improving is based on the priorities\nand initiatives from strategy deployment and begins with value streams\ndeveloping continuous improvement plans. The value streams manage\ntheir improvement activities in weekly value stream meetings. Controlling\nis based on daily lean management systems, deployed at the cell level,\nproviding the necessary daily control to meet customer needs and identify problems and issues. Managing is based on manager standard work,\ncoaching cycles and tiered meetings.\nThe best way to learn how lean management accounting is integrated\nwith lean practices is to follow a company through the entire value stream\nmanagement process. We are going to look at how Ross Manufacturing’s\nleadership team uses strategy deployment; how one of its value streams,\nthe Tube value stream, manages continuous improvement activities; how\nthe machine cell in the Tube value streams uses daily lean management for\n84 • Value Stream Management\ncontrol; and finally, how Ross’s accounting team has integrated itself into\nthe value stream management system.\nPLANNING THE VALUE STREAM – STRATEGY\nDEPLOYMENT\nThe practice of strategy deployment is also known as Hoshin or Hoshin\nKanri and it differs significantly from traditional planning processes.\nStrategy deployment focuses on actions to drive the numbers, not just\nwhat the numbers need to be. It focuses on a few annual objectives that are\nexpected to be met in the coming year and is a collaborative process where\nsenior leaders and managers agree on the actions. The strategy deployment\nprocess follows the PDCA cycle and is illustrated in Figure 7.2.\nA tool which is often used in strategy deployment is the X-matrix which\nis illustrated in Figure 7.3. The X-matrix is a one-page document to summarize strategy deployment for a company, value stream or department.\nThere are different versions of X-matrices, but all follow the general pattern\nof answering the basic questions, beginning on the left side of the matrix\nand moving in a clockwise direction:\n• What are the few objectives? Annual objectives on the left side of the\nmatrix.\nPlanning\nImproving\nControlling\nManaging\nFIGURE 7.1\nValue Stream Management System\nValue Stream Management • 85\n• How will they be achieved?

Ross’s five-year strategic plan is to leverage lean to create\na competitive advantage in the marketplace. The leadership team has\nidentified five specific annual objectives (the left side of Figure 7.4) for\nthe upcoming year:\n• Have the shortest lead times and highest on-time delivery in the\nindustry.\n• Improve operational productivity.\n• Continuously improve all business processes.\n• Reduce costs.\n• Further enhance respect for people.\nBased on these annual objectives Ross’s leaders determined five current\nyear company initiatives that will form the basis for improvement events\nthroughout the company. These five initiatives are:\n• Decrease order fulfillment lead times.\n• Monthly improvement events in all value streams and administrative\nprocesses.\n• Create 20% capacity.\n• Implement pull systems in all value streams.\n• Decrease safety incidents.\nRoss’s leadership team uses its company lean performance measurements\n(developed using the Linkage Chart process described in Chapter 4) to set\nthe improvement targets desired for the upcoming year:\n• 20% improvement in sales growth, lead times, delivery and\nproductivity.\nValue Stream Management\n• 87\nFIGURE 7.4\nRoss Manufacturing Company X-Matrix\nnewgenrtpdf\n88 • Value Stream Management\n• 5% decrease in labor expense as a percentage of sales.\n• 30% reduction in days of inventory.\n• 50% reduction in safety incident rate.\nAfter completing the company X-matrix, Ross’s leaders will meet with\neach of their value stream managers to review the document. After that\nmeeting, as part of the “do step” in the strategy deployment process, each\nvalue stream will develop its own X-matrix to align with the company\nX-matrix. We will now look at how Ross’s Tube value stream developed its\nX-matrix based on the company X-matrix.\nThe Do Step\nIn this step, the Tube value stream uses the company current year initiatives,\nfrom Figure 7.4, as its value stream annual objectives (the left side of its\nX-matrix), as illustrated in Figure 7.5. Using these objectives, the Tube\nvalue stream team identifies five areas of operational improvement to complete in the coming year (the top of Figure 7.5):\n• Improve quality and rework.\n• Implement single piece flow.\n• Reduce inventory.\n• Implement point-of-use delivery from top suppliers.\n• Implement safety training and audits.\nLike Ross’s leadership, the Tube value stream’s lean performance\nmeasurements were derived from the Linkage Chart and are used in their Xmatrix (the right side of Figure 7.5). When the team projected the expected\npercentage of improvement for its value stream performance measurements,\nthey realized they differed a bit from the company’s improvement targets.\nThis takes us to the next step of strategy deployment, the catchball process.\nThe Check Step – Catchball\nCatchball is a communication process where company leadership and value\nstream managers discuss initiatives, targets and resources to get consensus\non the few, critical actions which must be completed to achieve company\ngoals. Catchball is the opposite of traditional top-down management in\nValue Stream Management\n• 89\nFIGURE 7.5\nTube Value Stream X-Matrix\nnewgenrtpdf\n90 • Value Stream Management\nthat managers and leaders work together to agree in advance about what\nlevel of improvement managers are committing to, as opposed to top management dictating targets.\nLooking at the Tube value stream X-matrix in Figure 7.5, the Tube value\nstream has committed to improvement targets in line with the company\nX-matrix in productivity (sales per hours worked), inventory reduction,\nsafety and quality.\nThe Tube value stream team believes it can achieve a 30% reduction in\nlead time, rather than 20%, but can only commit to a 10% improvement in\non-time delivery because its current on-time delivery is quite high.\nIt believes it can get to a 100% improvement event participation rate\nbecause the entire value stream team is very enthusiastic about lean. After\ndiscussion between the Tube value stream manager and the Ross leadership\nteam, there is mutual agreement to these targets for the Tube value stream.\nThe Adjust Step\nThere are two outcomes in the adjust step in strategy deployment. The first\nis that X-matrices can be revised as a result of catchball. If there is consensus between the leadership team and the value streams, then the second\noutcome that can happen in the adjust step is that action plans for the year\ncan be finalized.\nFor the company initiatives, Ross’s leadership team identifies one of its\nmembers to be the sponsor of each initiative. The responsibility of each\nsponsor is to coordinate the improvement activities of all the value streams\nand measure progress using the company performance measurements.\nThe overriding goal of strategy deployment is to align the improvement\nactivities in a lean company around the company’s annual objectives and\ninitiatives. Now let’s look at how the Tube value stream manages improving\nits value stream.\nIMPROVING THE VALUE STREAM –\nCONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT\nAs explained in Chapter 3, continuous improvement is not random, haphazard or dictated by top management in lean companies. It is done by\nValue Stream Management • 91\nthe people who work in the process and managed by value stream teams.\nCompany leadership outlines the annual objectives in strategy deployment, and then it is up to value stream teams to determine the specific\nimprovements to be made to achieve their annual improvement targets.\nIn lean companies, the planning and conducting of improvement\nactivities follows the process as illustrated in Figure 7.6. The structured\napproach of following this process focuses on creating a new, improved\nand sustained standard of performance through:\n• Kaizen events, which are planned, multi-day events designed\nto achieve breakthrough change and derived through strategy\ndeployment.\n• Value stream improvement events, which are identified using value\nstream performance measurements. These improvement activities\nare identified in the weekly value stream team meeting and can be\nconducted as part of the value stream team’s regular work.\nNow let’s follow the Ross Manufacturing’s Tube value stream as it plans\nand manages its continuous improvement activities, following the process\nsummarized in Figure 7.6.\nPlan\nDo\nCheck\nAdjust\n1.

Developing a future state map\nis a design process, meaning the future state map is designed to achieve a\nlevel of improved performance based on these value stream performance\nmeasurements in the Tube value stream X-matrix. Using its current state\nbox score, as illustrated in Figure 7.7, the team projects the future state\nvalue stream performance measurements:\n• The first time through rate must improve from 58.3% to 70%. When\ndesigning the future state, each cell will have to be reviewed to determine their reduction in scrap rates.\n• Reducing days of inventory from 29.25 to 20.48 focuses the team on\nhow much work-in-process inventory must be reduced in the future\nstate.\nCurrent State Target Improvement Target Future State\nPerformance Measurements\nProductivity $ 2 27,797 0% $ 33,356\nDelivery 81% 10% 89%\nCost $ - 207 $ 2 $ 07\nQuality 58.3% 20% 70.0%\nDays Inventory 29.25 30% 20.48\nAverage Lead Time 10.78 30% 7.54\nCapacity\nProductive 64.90%\nNonproductive 42.64%\nAvailable -7.54%\nIncome Statement\nRevenue 861,696\nMaterials 292,516\nContribution Margin 569,180\nDirect Costs 127,484\nShared Costs 29,527\nTotal Production Costs 157,011\nValue Stream Operating Profit 412,169\n47.8%\nFIGURE 7.7\nCurrent State Box Score\nValue Stream Management • 93\n• The future state measurements of a 7.54-day lead time and 89% ontime delivery will help the team to determine which lean operating\npractices must be in place to create flow.\nUsing the current state map (Figure 7.8) as a baseline, the team designs\na future state value stream map, as illustrated in Figure 7.9, that will have\nimproved quality, less inventory, a shorter lead time and improved on-time\ndelivery. Comparing the future state map to the current state map, the team\nidentifies the following improvements:\n• Reducing scrap and rework in the machine and welding cells, through\na series of monthly improvement events.\n• Design and implement a pull system using single piece flow, which is\nexplained in Figure 7.9.\nThe final step in mapping the future state of the value stream is to\nupdate the future state box score, as shown in Figure 7.10. The purpose\nof creating a future state box score is to inform Ross’s leadership of the\nexpected improvements in both operating and financial performance.\nThe future state box score reveals the actual impact of the planned kaizen\nevents:\n• The improvement in all performance measurements exceeds the\ntargets set during strategy deployment.\n• About 20% capacity (from -7.54% to 14.61%) will be created due\nto the kaizen events which will allow the value stream to meet an\nexpected increase in demand and increase revenue.\n• The improvements in quality and days of inventory will reduce actual\nmaterial costs.\n• The freed-up capacity will allow the value stream to decrease overtime costs, which reduces direct costs.\nThe benefit of using box scores in future state mapping events is that\nit makes the mapping event a data-driven process rather than a “hopefor” process. The planned kaizen events will achieve the performance\nimprovements desired in strategy deployment. Now it’s just a matter of\nconducting the events.\n94\n• Value Stream Management\nQty = 30,000\nCycle Time = 70s\nBatch = 1500\nSet Up = 10,800s\nScrap = 10%\nRework = 20%\nDowntime = 15%\nInspection = 10%\nInsp Time = 120s\n# cells = 8\nCrew Size = 4\n# of people = 34\nShifts = 1\nQty = 15,000\nCycle Time = 180s\nBatch = 600\nSet Up = 1200s\nScrap = 5%\nRework = 10%\nDowntime = 5%\nInspection=100%\nInsp Time = 30s\n# cells = 5\nCrew Size = 1\n# of people = 10\nShifts = 2\nQty = 3,000\nCycle Time = 100s\nBatch = 20\nSet Up = 600s\nScrap = 0%\nRework = 10%\nDowntime = 0%\nInspection=100%\nInsp Time = 60s\n# cells = 2\nCrew Size = 5\n# of people = 10\nShifts = 1\nQty = 3,000\nCycle Time = 120s\nBatch = 1\nSet Up = 0s\nScrap = 0%\nRework = 2%\nDowntime = 0%\nInspection=0%\nInsp Time = 0s\n# cells = 1\nCrew Size = 1\n# of people = 1\nShifts = 1\nWelding Assembly Shipping WIP WIP FG Process 1\nWork\nOrder\nWork\nOrder\nWork\nOrder\nWork\nOrder\nMachine\nRM Shop\nReceiving\nInspection\nSupplier Customer\nScheduling\n/MRP\nPurchase Order Order\nDemand History\nPurchasing\nFIGURE 7.8\nTube Current State Value Stream Map\nnewgenrtpdf\nValue Stream Management\n• 95\nShipping Machine Shop\nPull\nWork\nOrder\nNon-Certified\nSupplier\nCustomer\nScheduling\n/ Planning\nBlanket PO\nPurchase Orders Order\nDemand Forecasts Certified Supplier\nPurchasing\nWelding\nBottleneck\nPull\nFIFO Assembly FIFO\n1 2 3 3\n2\nFlow is created with a pull system\n1.

In\nall cases I followed a structured agenda based on the PDCA process. Fully\nexplaining the details of how to conduct a kaizen event would be beyond\nthe scope of this book. If you would like to learn more about conducting\nkaizen events following the PDCA process, there are many good books\navailable, such as The Kaizen Event Planner by Karen Martin and Kaizen\nSketchbook by Marypat Cooper.\nWhat is important to discuss here, is how to integrate box scores and\nother relevant information into each kaizen event. This is illustrated by the\nsample A-3 for a kaizen event, as illustrated in Figure 7.11. For each kaizen\nevent, the Tube value stream team must gather and use the following data:\n• Box 2: Gather preliminary data, using components of the box score and\nrelevant event-specific information, to measure the extent of the problem\nin planning the event. This data will be finalized during the event.\n• Box 3: During the event, project future improvement targets using\nthe same data as used in box 2.\n• Box 6: Measure the effectiveness of solutions using the data from\nboxes 2 and 3.\nCurrent State Target Improvement Target Future State Future State Map Actual Improvement\nPerformance Measurements\nProductivity $ 27,797 20% $ 3 33,356 $ 2 4,490 4%\nDelivery 81% 10% 89% 100% 24%\nCost $ - 207 $ 2 $ 1 07 $ - 30 37%\nQuality 58.3% 20% 70.0% 78.6% 35%\nDays Inventory 29.25 30% 20.48 20.48 -30%\nAverage Lead Time 10.78 30% 7.54 5.39 -50%\nCapacity\nProductive 64.90% 64.90%\nNonproductive 42.64% 20.49%\nAvailable -7.54% 14.61%\nIncome Statement\nRevenue 861,696 1,069,200\nMaterials 292,516 204,761\nContribution Margin 569,180 864,439\nDirect Costs 127,484 117,233\nShared Costs 29,527 29,528\nTotal Production Costs 157,011 146,761\nValue Stream Operating Profit 412,169 717,678\n47.8% 67.1%\nFIGURE 7.10\nFuture State Box Score\nValue Stream Management\n• 97\nDefine the problem\n1.

The team\nmembers are made up of a value stream manager, operational managers\nand functional subject matter experts such as quality, engineering, sales\nand accounting.\nThe purpose of the weekly value stream team meeting is to manage the\nvalue stream towards its improvement targets by reviewing actual operating performance and the impact of all improvement events. The team\nconducts a weekly 30-minute meeting around the value stream visual\nboard (Figure 7.12), and the format of the board drives the agenda for the\nweekly meeting.\nThe top row of the board shows the trend of each performance measurement using a simple line graph, plotting actual performance against\nthe quarterly target.

The causes of poor operating performance are used to update\nthe Pareto charts in the second row of the board.\nNext, the team reviews the status of all active improvement activities and\nprovides updates. They assess actual results of all completed improvement\nevents and their impact on performance.\nThe adjust step in the weekly value stream meeting focuses on synthesizing all this information in relation to overall value stream performance\nas shown in the weekly box score (Figure 7.13). The output of the adjust\nstep can consist of any of the following:\n• A short-term operating action plan of countermeasures that focuses\non reacting to current operating conditions to better manage the flow\nof orders.\n• Adjusting the value stream improvement plan to eliminate the primary root causes of poor performance.\n• Escalating recurring problems and issues to the leadership team so\nit can remove roadblocks or provide the necessary resources to the\nTube value stream team to improve performance.\nIn the weekly meeting, using the weekly box score numbers makes it\neasier for the Tube value stream team to:\n• Identify the primary root causes of poor operating performance.\n• Better understand the relationships between operating and financial\nperformance trends.\n• Make the necessary adjustments to “get back on track.”\nThe weekly value stream team meeting is also a communication tool\nfor Ross’s leadership team. They are required to attend value stream team\nmeetings at least twice a month, as observers, to learn firsthand the current\ntrends in operating and financial performance rather than waiting on the\nmonth-end financial statements.\nNow let’s review daily lean management, which is the cornerstone to\ncontrolling the value stream.\n100\n• Value Stream Management\nFIGURE 7.13\nTube Value Stream Weekly Box Score\nnewgenrtpdf\nValue Stream Management • 101\nCONTROLLING – DAILY LEAN MANAGEMENT\nDaily lean management practices create a standard cadence of activities in\ncells to control the work, serve customers, identify problems, and troubleshoot problems as they occur. Daily lean management is the opposite of\ntraditional business firefighting, where employees are continually moving\nfrom problem to problem but never really solving the problems. Daily lean\nmanagement becomes the daily work routine for the employees in a cell.\nDaily lean management also follows the PDCA process, as illustrated in\nFigure 7.14, and is designed to reveal the underlying causes of performance issues in four primary areas, all related to serving customers:\n• Quality – is a process step capable of producing the same result every\ntime?\n• Availability – is a process step able to perform when needed?\n• Capacity – is a process step capacity adequate to perform when it\nneeds to perform?\n• Flexible – is a process step flexible to changing conditions?\nLet’s follow how the machine work cell in the Tube value stream set up\ntheir daily lean management system as they build their visual performance\nboard, which is illustrated in Figure 7.15, and develop an agenda for their\ndaily huddle.\nPlan\nDo\nCheck\nAdjust\n• Balance daily demand with\ncapacity\n• Flow the work\n• Standard troubleshooting\nresponses\n• Adjust the schedule\n• Identify just-do-it\nimprovements\n• Escalate problems to\nvalue stream for\nsupport\nDaily huddle:\n• Review daily performance\n• Identify root causes of problems\n• Understand trends vs. noise\nFIGURE 7.14\nDaily Lean Management Process\n102\n• Value Stream Management PLAN & DO: Daily Schedule & Status CHECK & ADJUST: Measurements and Actions\nJust-do-it\nimprovements\nSchedule\nattainment\nPareto: root\ncauses\nScrap & rework\nrate\nAvg. changeover\ntime\nHour Plan Actual Reason Defects &\nrework\nReason Changeover time\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\nPareto: root\ncauses\nPareto: root\ncauses\nJust-do-it\nimprovements\nJust-do-it\nimprovements\nSafety Cross\nFIGURE 7.15\nThe Visual Board\nnewgenrtpdf\nValue Stream Management • 103\nThe initial step for the machine cell team is to determine its daily lean performance measurements, which need to be aligned with strategy deployment. Using the Tube value stream X-matrix and value stream map, the\nmachine cell team selects the following lean performance measurements:\n• Schedule attainment – to understand the reasons it does not meet\ndaily demand.\n• Kanban levels – the implementation of the pull system will include\nstandard levels of work-in-process inventory levels in the cell.\nChanges in kanban levels indicate issues with flow and the team will\nmonitor these changes visually.\n• Scrap and rework rate – the Tube value stream plans to improve\nquality and measuring scrap and rework in the machine cell will provide the necessary root causes to plan improvements and measure\ntheir impact.\n• Changeover time – in order to reduce value stream lead time and\nimprove delivery, the machine cell must focus on understanding the\nunderlying causes of its changeover times.\n• Safety incidents – safety incidents will be measured daily using a\nsafety cross.\nAll of these daily lean performance measurements will be recorded on the\nvisual board, with the exception of kanban levels, which will be monitored\nvisually during the workday.\nPlan and Do – the Daily Schedule and Executing the Work\nThe plan step in daily lean management is to determine exactly what work can\nbe completed in the day, which requires balancing demand with the available\ncapacity. The cell team will use machine hours to determine available capacity.\nThe machine cell data box on the current state value stream map\n(Figure 7.8) gives the team the information to calculate available capacity,\nbased on 80% of total capacity, as follows:\n• 8 machines x one 8-hour shift = 64 total daily machine hours\n• 80% of 64 total hours = 51 available hours to schedule\nUsing 51 available hours per day, the team will calculate its plan each day in\nterms of the number of units to be completed in the 51 hours.\n104 • Value Stream Management\nNext, the team must determine how to schedule the day and how often\nto “check” actual to the schedule. Given that the average cycle time of the\nmachines is 70 seconds, the team determines it would be best to schedule\nand measure “day by the hour,” which is shown in the illustration of the\ndaily board in Figure 7.15.\nBy checking actual production against an hourly schedule, the team\nwill be able to understand and document current problems and make the\nnecessary schedule adjustments to catch up if production falls behind.\nThe team will use the “reason” column in the daily schedule to record why\nactual hourly production does not meet plan.\nIn order to understand scrap and rework, it will be also measured\non an hourly basis and the reasons will be recorded on the daily board.\nActual changeover time will be recorded when one occurs. This “day by\nthe hour” plan and status check will allow the cell team to respond with\ntroubleshooting to any abnormal conditions as they occur.\nCheck and Adjust – the Daily Huddle\nBecause the machine cell works one shift, the team decides to hold its daily\nhuddle around the visual board at the end of the shift. This will allow them\nto review the current day and set the plan for the next day, especially if\nschedule attainment was not achieved.\nPrior to the huddle, the performance measurements on the board are\nupdated – schedule attainment, scrap/rework, average changeover time.\nThese measures are presented in the format of a process control chart, as\nillustrated in Figure 7.16. Actual performance is plotted against average\nperformance, which is based on historical information. Safety is recorded\non a 20-working-day safety cross with green indicating no incidents and\nred indicating an incident.\nDuring the huddle, the team reviews each process control chart to\nidentify negative trends, which are considered two or more days below\nthe average. In cases of negative trends, an initial root cause analysis is\ndone during the meeting and specific actions, in the form of just-do-it\nimprovements, are scheduled. In cases where recurring problems cannot\nbe solved by the machine cell team, they escalate the problem to the Tube\nvalue stream team. As shown in Figure 7.15 both the root causes and\nimprovements related to each performance measurement are documented\non the visual board.\nValue Stream Management • 105\nThe cycle of daily lean management is conducive to learning about root\ncauses of operating performance through the use of relevant daily lean performance measures. It’s much easier to identify gaps from standard levels of\nperformance and their root causes on a daily basis than a longer time frame.\nA final note about daily lean management. Setting up daily lean management should be based on how fast a cell or process needs to identify and\nrespond to changing conditions and how long it takes for countermeasures\nto be reflected in process performance.\nIn the case of the machine cell, it used a “day-by-the-hour” plan and status\ncheck because of its short cycle times. In cells and processes with longer\ncycle times, such as services or knowledge-based work, it may be more relevant to set up cadences such as day-by-the-day or week-by-the day.\nMANAGING – ACCOUNTING’S ROLE IN\nVALUE STREAM MANAGEMENT\nThe numbers of lean management accounting – performance measurements and box scores – are the relevant and reliable information needed in\nlean companies, but they are simply tools which must be used properly to\n-\n5.00\n10.00\n15.00\n20.00\n25.00\n30.00\n35.00\n1-May\n2-May\n3-May\n4-May\n5-May\n6-May\n7-May\n8-May\n9-May\n10-May\n11-May\n12-May\n13-May\n14-May\n15-May\n16-May\n17-May\n18-May\n19-May\n20-May\n21-May\n22-May\n23-May\n24-May\nSchedule Attainment Process Control Chart\nFIGURE 7.16\nSchedule Attainment Process Control Chart\n106 • Value Stream Management\nbe effective. Integrating the numbers into standard lean practices such as\nstrategy deployment, improvement activities and daily lean management\nrequires foresight and leadership from accounting.\nRoss’s accounting team integrated itself into the value stream management practices to achieve two objectives: (1) to learn about the cause–effect\nrelationships between operating practices and financial performance, and\n(2) to provide the necessary coaching to help everyone else learn how to use\nthe numbers. Here are the specific practices the accounting team employs:\n• Each cost accounting manager is assigned to two value stream teams.\nThey attend all weekly meetings and respond to periodic analytical\nrequests. Each value stream team knows exactly which person in\naccounting to contact for rapid assistance.\n• An accounting team member is part of planned kaizen event teams\nor available as a subject matter expert during events. Accounting\nteam members are selected for kaizen teams based on how their work\nrelates to the process being studied in the kaizen event.\n• Each accounting team member has a regular schedule of daily\nhuddles to attend and observe. The huddle schedule is rotated periodically so all team members are exposed to all daily huddles being\nconducted in Ross.\n• Accounting is included in the escalation of problems and issues when\nfinancial performance may be impacted.\n• Each accounting team member has a Gemba walk schedule. They “go\nto the Gemba” regularly to visually see operations in action and engage\nwith people on problems and issues they are facing. Like the daily\nhuddle schedule, the Gemba walk schedule is rotated periodically.\nWRAP UP: VALUE STREAM MANAGEMENT\nAs part of a lean management accounting transformation, it is essential\nto integrate the numbers of lean management accounting into all lean\npractices to improve the quality of the numerous decisions which are made\nin strategy deployment, daily lean management and continuous improvement activities. It’s also important to also integrate the accounting team\nbecause they can provide the required analytical skills to establish the true\nValue Stream Management • 107\ncause–effect relationships between lean operating performance and financial performance.\nIt’s best to approach lean management accounting and lean practices\nsuch as strategy deployment, continuous improvement and daily lean\nmanagement as one holistic system rather than separate systems.\nIn the next chapter, we will look at integrating lean management\naccounting into the analytical and decision-making processes of lean\ncompanies.\n\nDOI: 10.4324/9781003304098-8 109\n8\nLean Decision Making\nBOX SCORE THINKING\nIn lean management accounting, the box score is the relevant and reliable information designed to improve the quality of decision making,\nas illustrated in Figure 8.1. The box score provides decision makers with\ninformation that is understandable in lean companies and is useful in all\ntypes of decisions. Box scores are based on actual information which is\nboth verifiable and valid.\nThe numbers and relationships in a box score make visible the true\nrelationships between lean operating performance and financial performance. This drives changes in the thinking habits of decision makers. The\nbox score components require decision makers to consider the overall economic impact of a decision both operationally and financially, which is\nsummarized in Figure 8.2.\nUSE THE PDCA PROCESS\nAnother element of lean decision making is using the PDCA process, as\nexplained in Chapter 3, as the standard work to follow when performing\nan analysis. Any business decision is an attempt to solve a problem. It\nmay be a gap from standard problem, where financial performance is\nbelow expectations, or it could be solving the problem of how to achieve\nan improved and sustained level of financial performance in the future.\nPDCA can be applied to decision making to:\n110 • Lean Decision Making\n• Compare a current state box score to a future state box score.\n• Consider the total incremental change to the box score over the time\nframe of the decision.\n• Identify the root causes which must be removed for the decision to\nachieve the future state.\nUsing a box score with the PDCA process creates a standardized approach\nto decision making that can be applied to all functions in a lean company.\nLet’s now look at how some companies use box scores and the PDCA process in lean decision making.\nDetermine changes in sales\nDetermine changes in actual fixed costs\nDetermine changes in variable costs and margin\nDetermine the impact on capacity\nDetermine the impact on performance\nDetermine the impact on cash\nFIGURE 8.2\nBox Score Visibility\nUnderstandable\nUseful\nTimely\nVerifiable\nValid\nEconomics of Lean\nLean Thinking\nQuality Decision Making\nRelevant information Reliable information\nFIGURE 8.1\nQuality Decision Making\nLean Decision Making • 111\nINCREASING CAPACITY TO MEET DEMAND\nPayroll Providers, Inc. is a locally owned company, with 15 employees,\nthat provides payroll services to local small and medium-size companies.\nMargaret, the owner of the company, previously worked as director of\nhuman resources for a larger company whose strategy was based on lean\nthinking. When Margaret started Payroll Providers, lean practices were\nincorporated into all aspects of work, including using a box score and a\nweekly improvement meeting.\nIn this week’s meeting, Margaret displays the current state box score\n(Figure 8.3, column A) and explains, based on projected client increases\nin headcount and Payroll Providers adding new clients, that the 7% available capacity is not enough to meet this increase in demand. Currently\nthey process payroll for 4,875 employees per month and this is expected to\nincrease by 23% to 6,000 employees per month.\nPayroll Providers, Inc.

She\nexplained that Payroll Providers’ profit would improve from $15,288 per\nmonth to $18,475 per month, but its return on sales would go down to 8.8%.\nThe team did not like the return on sales decreasing because their incentive\nprogram increases employee bonuses when the company achieves a 10%\nreturn on sales.\nThe team asked if she would allow them one week to come up with some\nimprovement activities that could create enough capacity to avoid hiring\nadditional employees. The team then reviewed what made up the 52% of\nnon-productive capacity in detail, and identified on three forms of waste:\n• 20% defect rate of information received from client companies that\nmust be corrected before processing.\n• 30% of their time is spent in a variety of reviewing and checking\nactivities, some of which is due to the defect rate.\n• 20% of time is spent on other non-value added activities that prevent\nthe team from processing payroll.\nThe team took a week to brainstorm some improvement activities and in\nnext week’s meeting they presented A-3 reports outlining improvements\nthat can be completed over the next two months to reduce waste, as follows:\n• Defect rate from 20% to 10%.\n• Checking and reviewing from 30% to 20%.\n• Other non-value added activities from 20% to 10%.\nMargaret entered the updated waste data into her capacity calculator and\nproduced a future state box score based on the improvements (Figure 8.3,\ncolumn C). She explained to the team that the planned improvement activities would create more than enough capacity for the expected increase in\ndemand and more than double monthly operating profit. They would also\nprovide a cushion of 18% available capacity to meet longer-term increases\nin demand. Additionally, these improvements would be beneficial operationally, as indicated by improved performance in productivity, cost,\nquality and flow time.\nMargaret used this as a learning opportunity. Even though she had the\nexperience to make the decision herself, she decided to let the people who\nLean Decision Making • 113\ndo the work solve the problem. The lessons learned when the people who\ndo the work solve the problem stay with those people. In this case the team\nlearned it is more beneficial financially to create capacity through continuous improvement rather than buying more capacity.\nMAKE OR BUY DECISION\nJoe, a Neutralia Company salesperson, was having a sales call meeting with\nKaren, the purchasing manager of Axent, a potential new customer. Karen\nexpressed an interest in a monthly order of 3,000 Pro-Valve 602s beginning\nin three months. Joe quoted the list price of $50 per unit, which had been\ncalculated based on a required 15% margin on the Pro-Valve 602 standard\ncost of $42.34. Karen thanked Joe for the quote and said she would get back\nto him. Two days later, Karen called Joe and explained that the $50 price\nwas too high for Axent and that Axent’s maximum price was $45 per unit.\nJoe, not wanting to lose the sale, and a new customer, let Karen know that\nhe would get back to her.\nKnowing Neutralia required a minimum of 15% margin on all sales, Joe\nthought that he would have to turn down the opportunity because the $45\nsales price would only yield a margin of 5.92%, as illustrated in Figure 8.4.\nBecause Joe really wanted to make this sale he decided to contact Neutralia’s\nsupply chain manager, Luis, in an effort to find a way to lower the cost of\nthe product to achieve the required 15% margin at a $45 sales price.\nFIGURE 8.4\nProfitability Using Standard Costing\n114 • Lean Decision Making\nLuis did some research and explained to Joe that the supplier of the raw\nmaterials would not agree to any purchase price discounts, but that he\nhad found a supplier who could produce Pro-Valve 602s for a lower price\nthan Neutralia’s standard cost. The supplier quoted a landed cost of $33.00\nper unit for Pro-Valve 602s. Joe ran the numbers, as shown in Figure 8.5,\nand the unit margin percentage for this order was now 21.17%, which was\nabove the 15% minimum required margin. Joe was excited to close the deal\nwith Axent and asked Luis to begin getting the new supplier set up. Luis\nexplained that before he would do this, he wanted Joe to contact Sanja, the\nPro-Valve value stream manager, to take another look at making this ProValve 602 order in-house by analyzing it using a lean accounting box score.\nJoe set up a meeting to talk with Sanja about this opportunity. Joe\nexplained that the price Karen was willing to pay would not achieve the\nrequired 15% unit margin, and Luis had found a supplier who could make\nthe product for a price that would achieve a 21.17% unit margin.\nSanja showed Joe his current state value stream box score, as shown in\ncolumn 1 of Figure 8.6, and explained that with 6% available capacity, he\ndid not have enough capacity to produce an additional 3,000 units per\nmonth. He asked Joe to give him a couple of days to work up future state\nbox scores based on outsourcing and making in-house by purchasing more\ncapacity.\nJoe and Sanja met two days later and Sanja displayed the Pro-Valve box\nscore on the conference room screen with two future states – outsourcing\nand making in-house. Using column 2 of Figure 8.6 as a reference, Sanja\nFIGURE 8.5\nProfitability Using Outsourcing\nLean Decision Making • 115\nexplained that while outsourcing would increase value stream profitability\nby almost $30,000 per month, it would also negatively impact value stream\noperating performance. Inconsistent supplier delivery would negatively\nimpact on-time delivery and force the value stream to stock inventory. The\nsupplier’s quality was also lower than the quality the value stream produced.\nSanja then directed Joe to look at the third column on the box score\n(column 3 of Figure 8.6). He explained to Joe that by purchasing two new\nmachines and hiring two new operators, the value stream could produce\nthe additional 3,000 units per month, and value stream profitability would\nbe $312,541 per month versus the $271,159 per month from outsourcing. Sanja also explained the operational benefits of the new machines –\nimproved productivity and better quality.\nJoe agreed with Sanja’s evaluation. Sanja explained that the next step was\nfor him and Joe to meet with Lois, the CFO, for final approval of buying\nthe machines and hiring the operators. Joe was delighted because he could\n1 2 3\nPro-Valve Value Stream Current State Future State Future State\nBox Score Outsource In-house\nPerformance Measurements\nProductivity $ 2 23,087 $ 2 5,301 8,451$\nDelivery 82% 78% 86%\nAverage Cost per Unit $ 1 15.97 $ 1 6.74 $ 7.44\nQuality (First Pass Rate) 88.0% 82.0% 92.0%\nDays Inventory 14 28 14\nCapacity\nProductive 62% 62% 68%\nNonproductive 32% 32% 20%\nAvailable 6% 6% 12%\nIncome Statement\nRevenue 1,408,333 1,543,333 1,543,333\nMaterial Cost 765,000 871,425 817,500\nContribution Margin 643,333 671,908 725,833\nValue Stream Costs\nLabor 267,083 267,083 276,559\nMachines 59,433 59,433 62,500\nOther Operating Expenses 74,233 74,233 74,233\nTotal Costs 400,749 400,749 413,292\nValue Stream Operating Profit 242,584 271,159 312,541\nReturn on Sales 17.2% 17.6% 20.3%\nFIGURE 8.6\nPro-Valve Value Stream Box Score\n116 • Lean Decision Making\nnow take the order at Karen’s desired price of $45.00 per unit and earn an\nexcellent sales commission.\nJoe learned that by using a box score, he gained a complete picture of\neach alternative in a make or buy decision. He learned a quality decision was based on much more than a standard margin percentage. It was\nbased on improving operating performance and financial performance\nsimultaneously.\nPRICING AND QUOTING DECISIONS\nAny company that sells products or services must set prices, which can\nbe published list prices or quoted prices. However, customers ultimately\ndecide prices based on the value they perceive they are receiving. In the\ncase of list prices, such as a restaurant menu, customers may choose not\nto eat at a specific restaurant if they consider the prices too high for the\nvalue received. In the case of quoted prices, customers may simply reject\nthe quote or attempt to negotiate a lower price.\nMany factors, beyond the scope of this book, go into setting prices. But\nthere are two common points of analysis in all price-setting activities:\n• Calculating a desired price to charge to earn a desired profit.\n• Calculating the profitability of actual prices customers are willing to\npay.\nIn lean management accounting, understanding a value stream hurdle rate\nis a useful and simple tool to use to calculate a desired price. Hurdle rates\nare commonly used in investment analysis, such as determining whether\nto invest in a company or in a project. A hurdle rate is calculated to understand the minimum acceptable rate of return expected to be received on\nan investment. In lean decision making, a value stream hurdle rate can be\nused to calculate a desired price to charge to earn a desired profit.\nCalculating the actual profitability in pricing and quoting is done by\nprojecting a future state box score. A future state box score will consider the\nimpact of both price and volume on overall value stream performance over\nthe time frame of the decision. Let’s now look at how one company uses\nthese hurdle rates and box scores to provide quotes and analyze profitability.\nLean Decision Making • 117\nMidwest Service Company is a regional truck service repair company\nthat provides maintenance and repair services to companies that have\ntruck fleets. Midwest has two value streams:\n• Maintenance – which focuses on performing routine, preventative\ntasks such as oil changes, fluid top-ups and basic inspections.\n• Major repair – which performs all repair services for customers.\nA new customer approached the sales team and requested a quote to\nperform routine preventative maintenance for their fleet of 500 trucks. The\nsales team has a strong desire to acquire the business of this new customer\nin the maintenance value stream because they have also indicated that they\nare considering outsourcing their repair work in the next year.\nMidwest’s planning process produces an updated 12-month financial\nforecast each quarter for both value streams. From these updated forecasts,\nthe accounting team calculates a value stream contribution margin hurdle\nrate, which is illustrated in Figure 8.7. The maintenance value stream’s 57%\nhurdle rate is the sum of the operating profit percentage of sales plus the\nfixed cost percentage of sales.\nThe sales team uses this hurdle rate to prepare quotes as shown in\nFigure 8.8. To prepare this quote, the sales team uses estimated variable\ncosts per truck of $17.00 based on the maintenance services the customer desires. The sales team calculates a quoted price of $39.53 using this\nformula:\nQuoted price = variable costs per unit / (1- contribution margin\nhurdle rate)\nValue Stream Income Statement Projection Maintenance % sales\nSales 2,800,000\nVariable costs 1,204,000\nContribution margin 1,596,000 57.00%\nFixed costs 616,000 22.00%\nOperating profit 980,000 35.00%\nHurdle Rate\nFIGURE 8.7\nMidwest Maintenance Hurdle Rate Calculation\n118 • Lean Decision Making\nAfter receiving the quote, the customer tells the sales department it\nwould like to pay only $38.00 per truck. This means the salesperson, the\nvalue stream manager and the value stream accountant must meet to calculate a future state box score to determine the impact on value stream\nprofitability of accepting a price of $38.00 per truck.\nThe first step for the team is to calculate the impact the 500 trucks\nper month has on value stream capacity and the profitability, which is\nsummarized in column B of Figure 8.9. At a price of $38.00 per truck\nthe incremental contribution margin of 55.26% is slightly better than\nthe current contribution margin of 52.78%, but there is not enough\ncapacity to meet this demand, which is indicated by the available capacity of -1%.\nThe next step is for the team to model options for increasing capacity.\nIt creates two future state box scores for two options: hiring more people\n(column C) and making improvements (column D).\nThe team concludes that accepting the customer’s price of $38.00 per\ntruck and hiring more people is not a good financial decision because\nit would decrease the return on sales from 29.63% to 27.48%, as well as\ndecreasing productivity.\nThe value stream manager prefers making improvements to create the\ncapacity because it generates an additional $15,000 of operating profit a\nmonth, decreases non-productive capacity and has a positive impact on\nperformance. The salesperson also explains that they believe the good performance in the maintenance value stream will favor Midwest’s acquisition\nof the repair services in the future.\n• $17.00 Variable cost\nper truck\n• ($17.00 / .43) = $39.53 Quote\nprice:\n• 500 trucks per month at $38.00 Customer\nRFQ:\n• Would you accept $38.00?\n• Is $38.00 still profitable?\n• Under what conditions?

It’s best\nto think of lean cost management as an integrated system embedded in\na lean company, as opposed to something accounting does. It’s based on\nprinciples, practices and tools which have been explained throughout this\nbook and will be summarized again here.\n• Economics of lean (Chapter 3) – continuous improvement creates\ncapacity and how the freed-up capacity is utilized determines the\nfinancial impact. Over time, lean will reduce costs in two ways:\n• Actual cost savings will be realized because improvement activities\nreduce wastes that have specific costs, such as reducing scrap by\nimproving quality.\n• The capacity created through improvement activities can be utilized\nto avoid future cost increases. A simple example is not having to\nhire additional employees to meet an increase in demand.\nA B C D Lean Performance Measurements Current State Opportunity Future State -Hire People Future State -Improvement\nProductivity $ 1 14,625 $ 1 3,243 5,892$\nOn-time delivery 81% 90% 90%\nQuality 20% 20% 15%\nAverage cost per unit 1 $ 0.42 $ 9 10.91 .45$\nLead time 8.21 7.44 7.44\nCapacity\nNumber of units produced 4875 500 5375 5375\nProductive capacity 36% 41% 34% 41%\nNon-productive capacity 52% 55% 50% 41%\nImprovement capacity 5% 5% 5% 5%\nAvailable capacity 7% -1% 11% 13%\nValue Stream Income Statement\nRevenue 219,375 19,000 238,375 238,375\nMaterial 103,594 8,500 114,219 107,500\nContribution margin 115,781 10,500 124,156 130,875\n52.78% 55.26% 52.08% 54.90%\nValue Stream Costs\nLabor - Regular 36,000 43,200 36,000\nLabor -Overtime 3,375 4,050 3,375\nDepreciation 6,400 6,400 6,400\nRepairs & Maintenance 1,000 1,000 1,000\nOther 4,000 4,000 4,000\nTotal value stream costs 50,775 58,650 50,775\nValue stream profit 65,006 65,506 80,100\nReturn on sales 29.63% 27.48% 33.60%\nFIGURE 8.9\nFuture State Box Scores\n120 • Lean Decision Making\n• Proper categorization of costs (Chapter 6) – costs are categorized\nbased on how each cost actually behaves:\n• Variable costs – costs that vary in direct proportion to changes in\nshort-term sales volume.\n• Fixed costs – costs that do not change in direct proportion to\nchanges in short-term sales volume and are influenced by management decisions.\n• Box score as an analytical tool (Figure 8.1) – the box score creates visibility and insight into the actual cause–effect relationships between\nlean operating performance and financial performance. Analyzing\nthe incremental change between a current state box score and a future\nstate box score will inform decision makers of the complete picture of\nany analysis and improve the quality of decision making.\nLet’s now look at some examples of how companies use box scores to\nmanage their costs.\nLabor Cost Management\nStrategic Tax Services, LLC (STS) is a local accounting firm that performs\naudits and prepares tax returns, which are the two value streams of the\ncompany. The tax value stream has a staff of 20 and they prepare and file\n1,000 tax returns a year. At the conclusion of this year’s tax filing season\nthe team met to review its performance using their value stream box score\nillustrated in Figure 8.10.\nJanet, the tax partner, explained there were many opportunities for\nimprovement for next tax season because 59% of the team’s capacity\n(Figure 8.1, column A) was being used on non-productive activities such\nas fixing defects, checking and reviewing, set ups and other administrative\nactivities. In the meeting she also announced that three employees, Mike,\nJo Ling and Armando, will be retiring after next tax season.\nJanet told the tax team the firm’s managing partner wants to improve the\nprofitability of the tax value stream by lowering labor cost as a percentage of\nsales from 45% to no greater than 40%. Using an adjusted current state box\nscore (Figure 8.1, column B), Janet explained this target can be achieved\nafter the three employees retire: labor cost will be 38% of sales, but there\nwill not be enough capacity to prepare and file the 1,000 tax returns.\nLean Decision Making • 121\nJanet further explained the managing partner has seen this box score\nand is challenging the tax value stream team to create enough capacity, so\nthe firm does not have to replace the three retiring employees.\nAdditionally, the managing partner wants to reduce the overburden on\nthe value stream and reduce the average overtime hours from 5 per day\nto 2.5 per day.\nThe team scheduled a two-day improvement event to develop improvement activities that could be implemented throughout the next tax season.\nThe first step of the event was to identify the specific non-productive\nactivities:\nNon-Productive Activity Minutes Percentage\nSet up 28,000 16%\nDefects 51,000 30%\nChecking & reviewing 53,000 31%\nOther 38,000 23%\nTotal 170,000 100%\nA B C\nCurrent State Current State Future State\n3 staff leave with improvements\nPerformance Measurements\nProductivity 25,000 $ $ 2 29,412 9,412$\nDelivery 80% 80% 85%\nAverage Set Up Time (minutes) 20 20 10\nCost per Return $ 2 289 $ 2 55 $ 55\nQuality (Defect Rate) 30% 30% 15%\nAverage Overtime Hours per Day 5 5 2.5\nAverage Processing Time (hours) 82 82 72\nCapacity\nProductive 42% 49% 59%\nNonproductive 59% 64% 37%\nAvailable -1% -13% 4%\nIncome Statement\nRevenue 500,000 500,000 500,000\nMaterials - - -\nContribution Margin 500,000 500,000 500,000\nValue Stream Costs\nLabor 224,000 45% 190,400 38% 190,400 38%\nOperating 55,000 55,000 55,000\nOther 10,000 10,000 10,000\nTotal Costs 289,000 255,400 255,400\nValue Stream Operating Profit 211,000 244,600 244,600\nReturn on Sales 42.2% 48.9% 48.9%\nFIGURE 8.10\nTax Value Stream Box Scores\n122 • Lean Decision Making\nUsing the “5-Why” method of identifying root causes, the team identified the primary root cause of each type of non-productive activity and\nidentified solutions to eliminate each root cause:\nCategory Root Cause Solution\nSet up Searching for information 5-S paper and electronic\ninformation\nDefects Clients deliver information\nin multiple formats\nInitial face-to-face client\nmeeting to review\ninformation\nChecking & reviewing 4 rounds of review per return Maximum 2 reviews per return\nBased on these solutions, the team calculated a future state box score\n(Figure 8.10, column C) with the updated capacity numbers, and it clearly\nshows that these improvements will create enough capacity to process the\ntax returns without having to replace the retired employees.\nWhat the tax value stream team learned is that labor cost represents how\nmuch is being paid for a fixed amount of capacity. In lean management\naccounting, managing labor cost is about developing a deep understanding\nof how employees spend their time, which can be either on value added,\nor non-value added activities. The box score capacity measurements make\nthis information visible. The tax value stream team was able to use the\ndetailed non-value added activity information to develop improvements\nto reduce non-productive capacity, increase available capacity, and control\nits labor cost.\nIn professional service companies that invoice customers based on billable hours, the same approach to labor cost management can be used at a\njob, project or contract level. This is possible because the same relationships\nbetween labor costs and activities apply. Understanding the root causes of\nactual billable hours for a job is about understanding the non-value added\nactivities consuming the time of the employees through the use of lean performance measurements and daily lean management practices, rather than\ntraditional time-tracking activities.\nMachine Cost Management\nIn some companies, machines provide capacity to perform value added\nactivities, and the box scores are effective for managing these costs. Waste\nLean Decision Making • 123\nand unavailability drive machine costs so it is important to measure these\naspects of machine performance in box scores:\n• Scrap or first time through rate.\n• Downtime rate.\n• Changeover times.\nImprovement activities focusing on reducing the forms of waste listed\nabove will ultimately manage machine costs such as replacement part\nexpense, outside maintenance costs and overtime of operators and maintenance employees. If a lack of machine capacity has forced a company to\noutsource some production, then this cost can also be reduced by creating\nmachine capacity to in-source previously outsourced work.\nMaterial Cost Management\nIn some industries, material costs are a primary variable cost, such as:\n• Parts and supplies in repair companies.\n• Food in restaurants.\n• Medical supplies and drugs in healthcare.\n• Raw materials and inventory in manufacturing.\nIn lean management accounting, material cost management practices focus\nprimarily on managing the quantity of material consumed rather than the\nprice. The quantity of material consumed is a function of:\n• Flow – the faster materials move through a value stream, the faster\nthey are converted into revenue and cash.\n• Scrap – consumes material and time and is pure waste.\n• Inventory – consumes cash and time, reduces flow and is pure waste.\nIn value streams which use materials, controlling material cost is about\nhaving relevant lean performance measurements to measure the three\nfactors listed above that influence the quantity of material consumed.\nImprovement activities to reduce scrap and inventory will have a direct\nimpact on reducing actual material cost and, in the case of inventory,\nincrease cash. The financial impact of improvement activities that improve\n124 • Lean Decision Making\nflow will not reduce cost but can drive sales growth and increase cash by\nreducing the cash conversion cycle.\nMaterial Price\nIn lean management accounting, price reduction has less of an impact\non total material cost than quantity because lean companies usually don’t\nseek out the lowest priced suppliers. This is because they recognize price\nis a function of value. Lean supply chain practices seek suppliers who\ndeliver the highest value in terms of quality, delivery and lead time, at the\nlowest price.\nWRAP UP: LEAN DECISION MAKING\nWhen I work with companies, I always tell them that building a box score\nis the easy part of a lean management accounting transformation! Using\nthe box score in decision making is the difficult part of the transformation.\nIt’s difficult because it requires decision makers to change thinking habits\nusing new numbers they are not yet familiar with.\nThinking habits will change with practice over time. But just like learning\nanything new, decision makers may need mentoring and coaching while\nusing box scores for decision making. This is where the role of accounting\nas financial coaches, as explained in Chapter 2, comes into play. Providing\nthe necessary coaching support for lean decision making will accelerate\nthe learning process of decision makers and improve the quality of decision making.\nDOI: 10.4324/9781003304098-9 125\n9\nDealing with Standard Costing:\nSimplifying Standard Setting\nINTRODUCTION\nStandard costing systems are deeply embedded in companies that use them,\nas illustrated in Figure 9.1. In most cases, standard costing systems are a\ncomponent of a company’s Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP system),\nwhich is usually a significant investment for a company. The information\nproduced by a standard costing system is used in management accounting\nto measure performance and analyze profitability. In financial accounting,\nstandard costing values inventory for financial reporting. A standard\ncosting system also goes a long way to defining the role of accounting and\naccountants in using and maintaining the system.\nThe problem with standard costing systems is that they do not work well\nin lean companies because they were designed to support mass production\nmanufacturing. Standard costing works well in mass production manufacturing, because one of mass production manufacturing’s operating elements is stability and repetition. Frederick Winslow Taylor’s Principles of\nScientific Management (1911), which forms the foundation for mass production, stressed optimizing and simplifying tasks by using time studies.\nPeople are assigned specific tasks, which are designed to take a specific\namount of time. Actual times are measured against standard times to\nmeasure operating efficiency.\nBecause inventories in mass production companies were quite large,\nspecific identification of inventory costs became too difficult. That led to\nthe development of standard costing systems to perform inventory valuation. Standard costing systems use the time-study information to calculate a standard product cost, which is used to value inventory and cost of\n126 • Standard Costing: Simplifying Standard Setting\ngoods sold. This naturally led to accounting using production variances\nto measure the efficiency of operations and product costs for profitability\nanalysis.\nAs a Lean CFO, if your lean company uses a standard costing system it\nis inevitable that you, and your company, will have to “deal” with standard\ncosting because it contains a great deal of waste, as summarized in Figure 9.2.\nPoor quality is the primary source of waste in standard costing systems in\nlean companies because the information it produces is no longer relevant\nor reliable to decision makers. This waste is eliminated by developing a lean\nmanagement accounting system.\nBecause a lean management accounting system is “standard cost free,”\nit means the remaining use of a standard costing system is to value inventory for financial reporting purposes, which still requires setting standards\nand reporting transactions. This creates an opportunity to apply continuous improvement to your standard costing system to eliminate waste\nStandard\nCosting\nInventory\nvaluation\nProduction\nreporting\nSetting\nstandards\nPerformance\nmeasurement\nAnalyzing\nprofitability\nRole of\naccounting\nFIGURE 9.1\nStandard Costing Systems\nStandard Costing: Simplifying Standard Setting • 127\nin standard setting and production reporting processes. Another improvement opportunity is to “turn off ” standard costing for inventory valuation\npurposes and replace it with a lean inventory valuation methodology.\nThis chapter, and the next two, are written to explain the sequence of\npossible improvements you can make to your company’s standard costing\nsystem, based on the actual improvements made in companies I have\nworked with. This chapter will explain how to simplify standard setting;\nChapter 10 will explain how to eliminate unnecessary ERP transactions;\nand Chapter 11 will explain how lean inventory valuation methods can be\nused to replace standard costing.\nSTANDARDS ARE STATIC, LEAN IS DYNAMIC\nAs a Lean CFO, you must recognize early in your company’s lean transformation that lean practices will wreak havoc on standard setting.\nSetting standards for costing purposes requires making many static\nassumptions about the data that are used to calculate standard costs.\nLean practices are dynamic because they are all about changing and\nimproving production processes, the physical layout, and having flexibility with people and machines.\nThe impact of lean on a standard costing system will be more fluctuation of absorption and variances, which will be even more difficult to\nDefects • Information is not relevant or reliable to users\nOverproduction • Information is produced and not used\nWaiting • Long feedback loops prevent root cause analysis\nNeglect of talent • Activities beneath the talent level of users\nTransportation • Handoffs of information between systems and people\nInventory • Annual setting of standards & rates\nMotion • Unnecessary searching for information\nExcess processing • Detailed transaction reporting\nFIGURE 9.2\nStandard Costing System Waste\n128 • Standard Costing: Simplifying Standard Setting\nexplain than before becoming lean. The reason this will occur is that the\nrate of change in lean operations makes the assumptions used in standard\nsetting invalid, and keeping all the assumptions up to date is an impossible task.\nIt’s best to be proactive and begin simplifying standard setting at the\nbeginning of a lean transformation. Being proactive in this will prevent a\nlot of unnecessary work in the future, like trying to answer, “What’s going\non with standards or variances?” This needs to be looked at as a series of\nproblems to be solved based on exactly how the detailed input is used to\nset standards.\nSimplifying standard setting is based on understanding how your ERP\nsystem uses various pieces of data and information to calculate standard\ncosts. Fortunately, all ERP systems do this pretty much the same way,\nalthough the terminology each ERP system uses may be different. The configuration of routers, bills of material, material costs, labor, and overhead\nrates determines the complexity of a standard costing system. Let’s now\nlook at how to improve setting these standards, beginning with information used to calculate material costs.\nSIMPLIFYING MATERIAL STANDARD SETTING\nMaterial cost is calculated from the bills of material. The components of\nbills of material are used by a standard costing system to do some basic\nmath – multiply the quantity of each line item by its standard cost and total\nthese costs to get the standard material cost of a product.\nLean practices, primarily around improving the flow of materials, create\nimprovement opportunities to simplify the components of bills of material\nused to set material standard costs, which are summarized in Figure 9.3.\nLet’s look at each opportunity in detail.\nReducing the Number of Bills of Material\nA bill of material must be created for any product that gets recorded as\ncompleted production in an ERP system – all finished goods, as well as any\nsub-assemblies that get recorded into stock. In traditional manufacturing,\nStandard Costing: Simplifying Standard Setting • 129\nsub-assemblies are typically produced independently of the finished good\nthat they are part of, so they require their own bills of material. The bill\nof material for the finished goods will have on it all sub-assemblies taken\nfrom stock, as well as other raw materials consumed.\nSingle piece flow and pull systems may eliminate the need for subassemblies to be stocked as inventory, because their production is\ncoordinated based on the production of the finished goods rather than\nbeing independently produced. This means sub-assemblies don’t have to\nbe reported as completed production and thus do not need separate bills of\nmaterial. The components of the sub-assemblies can be added to the bills\nof material of their respective finished good products. An improvement\nobjective would be for the number of bills of material to match the number\nof finished goods that a company produces.\nIt is also possible to further reduce the number of bills of material based\non ERP system features, especially in the case of custom products. In traditional manufacturing, producing custom products has an exponential\neffect on the number of bills of material because each unique part number\nmust have a bill of material.\nSome ERP systems have one-time “configurable” bills of material,\nwhich build a unique bill of material for a customized product as the\nmaterial is consumed during production. Another ERP system feature is\nallowing the substitution of parts on existing bills of material to create\na “new” bill of material for a new part. In both cases, it’s possible to\nuse system features and have even fewer bills of material to build and\nmaintain.\nTraditional drivers of complexity Lean drivers of simplicity\nNumber of bills of material Each item reported as subassemblies and finished goods\nBOMs based on finished goods\nonly\nNumber of parts and line items MRP, purchasing and “inventory\ncontrol” by ERP\nPull systems and visual control\nQuantity per assembly Costing, purchasing and\n“inventory control” by ERP\nActual quantity based on product\ndesign\nMaterial cost Standard costing and variance\nanalysis\nAverage cost or last price paid\nFIGURE 9.3\nSimplifying Bills of Materials\n130 • Standard Costing: Simplifying Standard Setting\nReducing the Number of Part Line Items\nTraditional manufacturing companies like to list every possible item, no\nmatter how large or small, on bills of material. The reasons for this are:\n• To generate variances such as material usage for performance\nmeasurement.\n• For system-based inventory control to be able to look “in the system”\nat quantities on hand.\n• For purchasing purposes so material requirements planning modules\n(MRP) can produce purchase orders.\nIn a lean company, the pull systems and visual management practices\nin place on the shop floor and with suppliers will regulate the quantity\nof material purchased and used, eliminating the need for system control.\nKanban signals from operations to purchasing and suppliers are used, eliminating the need for MRP to signal when to purchase. Point-of-use inventory in value streams manages the usage of materials, including allowable\nsubstitutions, eliminating the need for material usage variances.\nItems on bills of material can be further simplified by eliminating small\nparts, such as screws, or difficult-to-measure ingredients. Treat these items\nas shop supplies and incorporate kanban signals for reordering.\nImproving Quantity per Assembly\nEvery item listed on a bill of material must have a quantity used. The actual\nquantity used for every part is typically determined in the product development process. However, because of the same reasons mentioned in the\nprevious section – generation of variances and MRP-based purchasing –\nthe actual quantity per assembly on the bill may be different.\nFor example, should the quantity per assembly include a yield rate, which\nis the scrap rate? If a yield rate is included, what should the yield rate be\nand how do we know it is consistent? Even more difficult are “parts” which\nare more like consumable supplies, such as paints and powders. The quantity used is often difficult to measure (e.g., “Who really knows exactly how\nmuch paint is used to coat a product?”)\nImprovement opportunities can focus on the goal of quantity per\nassembly being based on the actual quantity of a part needed to produce\nStandard Costing: Simplifying Standard Setting • 131\nthe product based on engineering specifications. The pull systems and\nvisual management practices in operations will regulate the quantity of\nmaterial purchased and used, eliminating the need for system control and\nMRP purchasing.\nThe lean performance measurement of quality is used to analyze scrap\nand other quality issues, identify root causes, and focus improvement\nefforts. When these lean practices are in place, quantity per assembly can\nbe adjusted to actual quantity based on the design specifications.\nImproving Material Cost\nTraditional manufacturing companies spend a great deal of time determining the “standard” material cost to enter for each purchased part. The\nprimary reason is to use purchase price variance (PPV) and material usage\nvariance as performance measurements.\nSome companies keep it simple: set the standard cost based on the price\nthe supplier charges. Other companies try to get creative by entering the\nprice they would like to pay, so that the effectiveness of the purchasing\ndepartment, or suppliers, can be measured using PPV. In some cases,\ndetermining the purchase price is difficult. One example is commodity\nprices, which fluctuate frequently. In other cases, suppliers may change\nprices without warning. Lean companies recognize that PPV and material\nusage variance are meaningless measures.\nLean organizations usually don’t seek out the lowest-price suppliers\nbecause they understand price is a function of value. Lean organizations\nwant more out of their suppliers than the lowest price, they want their\nsuppliers to be partners in improving material flow. Lean organizations\nseek suppliers who deliver the highest value in terms of quality, delivery,\nand lead time, at the lowest price. In many lean organizations, supplier\ncertification programs are present where suppliers must continually meet\nagreed-upon performance requirements.\nImprovement efforts should focus on moving away from determining a\nstandard cost set annually to either average cost or last price paid. In many\nERP systems, this is a system configuration setting that can be changed.\nImproving material cost standard setting is best approached as a\ncross-functional series of improvements with the stakeholders in bills\nof material included – accounting, engineering, operations, and purchasing. By using the PDCA approach to improving material standard\n132 • Standard Costing: Simplifying Standard Setting\nsetting, it’s probable that every stakeholder will see the benefits of simplifying material cost standard setting, such as reducing the amount of nonproductive time that goes into maintaining bills of material. Figure 9.4\nsummarizes some improvement opportunities I have seen companies use\nin bills of material.\nSIMPLIFYING LABOR AND OVERHEAD\nSTANDARD SETTING\nThe source data to calculate labor and overhead costs are the labor and\noverhead rates and run rates for each step in a routing on a work order.\nThis information, summarized in Figure 9.5, is somewhat subjective and\nmust be estimated. The drivers of waste in labor and overhead rate standard\nsetting are based on the conventional uses of standard costs:\nNumber of\nBOMs\nNumber of\nsub-assemblies &\nfinished goods\nreported as inventory\n1.

If you\nthink of an ERP system as a very expensive calculator, it must be configured\nto the level of desired detail to do the calculations of product costs and\nmeasure variances at each possible production step. Let’s review the complexity in ERP configuration first, before moving on to improvement\napproaches.\nThe first step is to identify all possible production steps in the factory\nthat must be configured in the ERP system. These are typically called work\ncenters or production steps in ERP systems. Accounting must develop\nlabor and overhead rates for each work center as follows:\n• Standard labor rate = labor cost / estimated labor hours\n• Standard overhead rate = overhead costs / estimated labor hours or\ndollars\nSome of these costs are easy to identify, such as how many people work\nin a work center. Overhead costs for each work center are more difficult\nto specifically identify. The conventional approach for overhead costs is to\ndevelop complex allocation schemes to assign as many costs as possible, so\nthat the ERP system can create an “accurate” product cost.\nTraditional drivers of complexity Lean drivers of simplicity\nNumber of rates Detailed product costing by work\ncenter\nValue stream cost analysis\nRun rates Detailed rates designed to\nmaximize absorption\nSimple average\nNumber of work centers & router\nsteps\nERP production control; detailed\nproduct costing; variance analysis\nPull systems reduce the number\nof both\nNumber of routers Each item reported as subassemblies and finished goods\nRouters based on finished goods\nonly\nFIGURE 9.5\nSimplifying Labor and Overhead Rates\n134 • Standard Costing: Simplifying Standard Setting\nThe denominator in the standard labor rate calculation, estimated labor\nhours, is very much a guess. There are many factors that will drive estimating labor hours, such as estimating demand, product mix and production issues at each work center. Various analytical methods can be used to\nlook at past trends, but past trends are not a predictor of the future.\nNext step in configuring the ERP system is to create routers for each\nproduct. Routers are the specific sequence of work centers the product\ngoes through in production. Each step on the router of a product must\nbe given a run rate, which is the time it takes to complete the work in that\nprocess step. Determining the run rate is very similar to determining the\nquantity of each part on a bill of material. For products that are produced\nby machines the run rate may be easy to determine – the actual cycle time\nin the machine. However, this can be complicated by the desire to include\nset-up or changeover time as part of the run rate, which is driven by MRP\nplanning and overhead absorption purposes.\nFor products that are assembled by employees, the run rate can be more\nof an estimate, due to a variety of issues. One simple example would be the\ncase of a more experienced worker being able to assemble a product at a\nrate 20% faster than an inexperienced worker. What is the correct run rate\nto use? Run rates may also be set at the ideal run rate, to generate variances.\nSome companies also include set-up or changeover time to inflate run rates\nand increase absorption. Many factors can come into play in estimating\nlabor run rates.\nRouters become part of work orders or job orders in ERP systems. At a\nbasic level, the purpose of work orders is to convert the raw material into\nfinished goods in the ERP system. As production steps are completed, the\nwork order will calculate standard labor and overhead costs, add these costs\nto the material cost and calculate the standard cost of the finished good.\nIf actual material and time are reported against work orders, it will also\ncalculate an actual cost and variances. In Chapter 10, we will discuss transaction elimination as it relates to work orders.\nLet’s now look at improvement approaches to simplify labor and overhead rate setting.\nImpact of Lean Practices on Routers and Rates\nCreating flow in production is really re-designing processes based on\nlean practices. This means that current work centers will probably be\nStandard Costing: Simplifying Standard Setting • 135\ncombined, eliminated, or sequenced differently based on physical changes\nin operations. Continuous improvement can also have an impact on the\ncycle times to complete a production step, the number of people needed in\na production step, as well as eliminating downtime and changeover time.\nThis means that today’s physical layout and work activities, which drive\nthe ERP configuration and rate setting, will constantly be changing. This\nmakes it very difficult to keep detailed work centers, routers and rates up\nto date.\nReduce Number of Labor and Overhead Rates\nBox scores and lean performance measurements eliminate the need for\ndetailed product costing and variance analysis. This create the opportunity\nto reduce the number of labor and overhead rates. Inventory still must be\nvalued using the standard costing system, but the new objective is the total\nvaluation of inventory rather than product-by-product. The goal would be\nto continually reduce labor and overhead rates and strive for one labor rate\nand one overhead rate for each location.\nSimplify Run Rates\nThe need for highly engineered run rates to measure operating performance variances is replaced by lean performance measurements and visual\nlean operating practices. The need for “accurate” run rates to calculate an\naccurate product cost is also eliminated. Run rates for machines can be at\nthe actual cycle time, without any set-up time included. Labor run rates\ncan be a simple average, based on lean-focused time studies.\nReduce Number of Work Centers\nDetailed work centers and routers on work orders are used to report actual\nto generate variances by production step. With lean operating practices, the\nneed for variance analysis is eliminated. Daily lean management practices,\nas explained in Chapter 7, are used to control cell operations and identify\ngaps from standard. Pull systems regulate both production and inventory\nin a value stream. Every resource in the value stream knows through visual\nsignals what needs to be worked on and when.\n136 • Standard Costing: Simplifying Standard Setting\nThis creates the opportunity to reduce the number of work centers in\nthe ERP system. Fewer work centers mean fewer labor and overhead rates.\nFewer work centers also mean fewer production reporting steps on work\norders. This opportunity is company specific and may even be value stream\nspecific. Here are some general guidelines to consider.\n• High volume production – if the total production time for products is\nminutes or a few days, it may be possible to have one work center for\neach product or product families that with the same production steps.\n• Low volume production – if total production time is weeks, it would\nbe best to consider any other uses of the work centers and reduce\nthem to the minimal necessary for these other uses.\nStrive for One Labor and One Overhead Rate\nFigure 9.6 summarizes improvement opportunities in setting labor and\noverhead rates.

This work can begin early in your company’s lean\ntransformation. By simplifying standard costing, you will also be eliminating a tremendous amount of waste in your accounting processes, and you\ncan reallocate this created capacity towards lean management accounting.\nThe next step in dealing with standard costing is to eliminate the waste\nof unnecessary production reporting transactions, which will be explained\nin Chapter 10.\n\nDOI: 10.4324/9781003304098-10 139\n10\nDealing with Standard Costing:\nTransaction Elimination\nERP AND THE CFO\nEnterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems are an integral part of every\nmanufacturing company and also a very large investment in terms of cost,\nmaintenance and support. Every employee, at some level, interacts with\nthe ERP system, whether to process transactions, record information, read\nreports or use the information in decision making. The daily functioning\nof a company is totally dependent on an ERP system, which is exhibited in\nFigure 10.1.\nAs a CFO, you have a major stake in your company’s ERP system. Your\nfinancial reports are produced from the general ledger maintained in\nthe ERP system. The source of much of the accounting data comes from\nproduction transaction reporting. Revenue recognition is dependent on\nwhich products are made and shipped. Inventory value is based on properly recording material transactions. And in a product costing system,\nvariances, absorption, and cost of goods sold are all based on transactions.\nProper control of these transactions is essential to accurate and reliable\nfinancial statements.\nIn traditional manufacturing companies, accounting and operations\nusually agree on the need and uses of the ERP system. Traditional manufacturing operating practices use ERP to schedule and plan the execution\nof work, track inventory, and report operating performance. The transaction control gives both operations and finance the information they need\nfor control and reporting.\nThis common ground between operations and accounting on ERP\nsystems begins to diverge when lean is introduced into a company. One\n140 • Standard Costing: Transaction Elimination\nway to look at this is it creates conflict, but another way to look at it is as\nan opportunity to eliminate waste in ERP transaction reporting. Let’s compare the role of ERP in traditional and lean manufacturing.\nTRADITIONAL MANUFACTURING AND ERP\nERP systems are designed to support traditional manufacturing management practices of “transactional control.” Transactional control allows\nusers to use the various tools of the system to plan, track and control\nproduction, inventory, purchasing and costs. ERP systems are designed\nto collect and report unlimited amounts of information based on how a\ncompany configures the set-up of the software. Figure 10.2 illustrates a\ntypical level of detailed ERP transactional control in a traditional manufacturing environment. Another feature of ERP systems is the ability to\nsummarize and report information to management to support top-down\ndecision making.\nProduction\nActivity\nBOM Control\nMRP\nWork Orders\nPart Number\nControl\nWork Centers\nRoutings\nProduct\nCosting\nSales Orders\nERP system\nShop\nCalendar\nPurchasing\nVariance &\nOverhead\nCalculation\nA/P\nGeneral\nLedger\nA/R\nInventory\nControl\nShipments\nFIGURE 10.1\nTypical ERP System Flowchart\nStandard Costing: Transaction Elimination\n• 141\nWelding Assembly Shipping WIP WIP FG Process 1\nWork\nOrder\nWork\nOrder\nWork\nOrder\nWork\nOrder\nMachine\nRM Shop\nReceiving\nInspection\nSupplier Customer\nScheduling\n/MRP\nPurchase Order Order\nDemand History\nPurchasing\nAP/\nProcess\nPayments\nCompare\nInvoice/\nShipper/\nOrder\nCompare\nReceipt/\nPO /\nInvoice\nPO\nApproval\nPO\nSourcing\n/ Bids\nTrack\nLabor &\nMaterials\nCycle\nCount\nTrack\nLabor &\nMaterials\nTrack\nLabor &\nMaterials\nCycle\nCount\nCycle\nCount\nCycle\nCount\nReview\nUsage\nReview\nOn Hand\nRouting Part #’s BOM\nRouting\nControl\nPart\nControl\nBOM\nControl\nStandard\nCost\nVariance\nStandard\nCost\nVariance\nBudget\n/Actual\nVariance\nAnalysis\nAdjust\nInventory to\nActual\nInventory\nControl\nTrack\nActual\nQty’s\nTrack\nActual\nQty’s\nTrack\nActual\nQty’s\nTrack\nActual\nQty’s\nFIGURE 10.2\nERP Transactional Controls in Traditional Manufacturing\nnewgenrtpdf\n142 • Standard Costing: Transaction Elimination\nLEAN MANUFACTURING AND ERP\nA lean operating system is a real-time execution system. It is proactively\ndesigned to flow actual (orders) as fast as possible through value streams.\nFlow is continually managed and maintained visually by the people in the\nvalue stream. What needs to be worked on can be seen, and interruptions to\nflow are made visible immediately and dealt with rapidly.\nThe various lean methods and practices to create flow are referred to as\na pull system, and such systems virtually eliminate the need for ERP transactional control. For example, all material is visible and at the point of use\nin the value stream. Kanban levels in supermarkets are used to regulate\nproduction and limit inventory. The impact is to stabilize the amount of\nmaterial in operations based on kanban levels and send clear signals for\nreplenishment. What needs to be worked on next, and in what quantities,\nis always “visible” to everyone. The need to track material movement in\ngreat detail in order to “look into ERP” to find out where material is located\nis mitigated with these controls.\nFigure 10.3 illustrates the typical visual controls in a pull system. These\npractices can totally control operations from the point material is received\nfrom suppliers through to when finished goods are shipped to customers.\nThe deployment and maturity of these lean practices open up opportunities to reduce or eliminate what are now unnecessary ERP reporting\ntransactions.\nIt’s best to consider transaction elimination as a series of continuous\nimprovement activities that will occur over time, based on the effectiveness of lean controls. As lean controls become effective, they replace the\ntransactional controls. From a CFO viewpoint, it is important to develop\nan understanding of lean controls primarily by going to the Gemba and\ndirectly observing their effectiveness.\nNow let’s look at improvement opportunities in transaction elimination.\nREDUCING WORK ORDER TRANSACTIONS\nWork orders are like a Swiss army knife – one tool that performs multiple\nfunctions. Work orders are used to initiate production, track production,\nStandard Costing: Transaction Elimination\n• 143\nShipping Machine Shop\nPull\nWork\nOrder\nNon-Certified\nSupplier\nCustomer\nScheduling\n/ Planning\nPurchase Orders Order\nDemand Forecasts Certified Supplier\nPurchasing\nWelding\nBottleneck\nPull\nSupplier FIFO Assembly FIFO\nManaged\nInventory\nMake to\nOrder\nLean Production Controls: Daily Cell\nMeasures of Schedule Attainment & Quality;\nStandard Work, Gemba Walks, Standard\nInventory\nValue Stream\nMeasures Box\nScore\nVisual\nControl of\nInventory\nVisual\nControl of\nInventory\nFG Shipped\nupon\nCompletion\nPay\nSupplier\nSupplier\nCertification\nMaster\nPO\nPO\nApproval\nPO\nSourcing\n/ Bids\nVisual\nControl of\nInventory Visual\nControl of\nInventory\nFIGURE 10.3\nLean Controls that replace ERP Transactional Controls\nnewgenrtpdf\n144 • Standard Costing: Transaction Elimination\nreport completed production, report scrap, and report “actual,” all of which\nrequire transactions. In addition, work orders may also provide work\ninstructions or other technical information for operators.\nFigure 10.3 summarizes improvement opportunities to reduce work\norder transactions, which will now be explained in detail.\nStop Reporting Actual\nActual material and labor are reported to work orders to generate variances\nfor evaluating operating performance. The combination of lean performance measurements and daily lean management practices is used to identify\ngaps from standard in real time, which allows for both troubleshooting and\njust-do-it improvements. These practices eliminate the need for reporting\nactual material and labor to work orders.\nBegin Backflushing\nEvery router step on a work order must be reported as completed so the work\norder can “move” the material from raw material through work-in-process\nto finished goods. Because actual is no longer being reported, the opportunity to introduce backflushing can reduce the number of router steps that\nmust be reported as completed. Backflushing is best explained visually.\nFigure 10.5 illustrates a work order with 10 production steps in its\nrouter. Without backflushing, each of the 10 steps must be reported as\ncompleted, as well as opening and closing the work order, for a total of\n12 transactions. When backflushing is introduced, specific router steps\ncan be selected as reporting steps and when these steps are reported\nthe ERP system assumes the previous steps were also completed. In\nFigure 10.5, let’s say router steps three, five and seven are selected as\nreporting steps. When step three is reported complete, the system will\nalso record steps one and two as complete. And when the work order\nis closed, the system will automatically record steps eight through ten\ncompleted. In this example, backflushing has now reduced work order\ntransactions by 58%!\nOver time, as the flow of orders moves faster through a value stream,\nbackflushing can be adjusted to further reduce the number of reporting\nsteps, with a goal of two reporting steps – opening and closing the\nwork order.\nStandard Costing: Transaction Elimination • 145\nReduce Router Steps\nThe first two improvement opportunities eliminate the need for detailed\nrouters on work orders. Basic visual controls throughout the value stream\nwill regulate the work between cells and create initial improvements in\nflow, which further mitigates the need for detailed router steps. As pull\nsystems provide more effective control, router steps on work orders can be\nreduced by having as few steps as possible on work orders. A goal to strive\nfor would be one router step – produce the product! Fewer router steps\nmean fewer transactions reported.\nOpen\nwork\norder\nStep\n1\nStep\n2\nStep\n3\nStep\n4\nStep\n5\nStep\n6\nStep\n7\nStep\n8\nStep\n9\nStep\n10\nClose\nwork\norder\nTraditional Job Step Reporting – 12 transactions\nOpen\nwork\norder\nStep\n1\nStep\n2\nStep\n3\nStep\n4\nStep\n5\nStep\n6\nStep\n7\nStep\n8\nStep\n9\nStep\n10\nClose\nwork\norder\nBackflushing – 5 transactions\nFIGURE 10.5\nExample of Backflushing\nImprovement Lean Control in Place\nStop reporting actual Lean performance measurements and daily\nlean management\nBackflushing Lean performance measurements\nReduce router steps Basic visual production controls\nOne-step router Effective pull throughout production\nDecrease number of work orders Basic visual production controls, fewer subassemblies in stock\nFIGURE 10.4\nReducing Work Order Transactions\n146 • Standard Costing: Transaction Elimination\nDecrease Number of Work Orders\nAs mentioned in Chapter 9, a work order must exist for every item\nreported to stock, either as a finished good or sub-assembly. As flow\nis introduced into a value stream, one outcome may be that subassemblies are now produced in a make-to-order fashion rather than\nmake-to-stock. If this is the case, these sub-assembly work orders can\nbe eliminated, and the production steps may be combined into finished\ngood work orders.\nAnother improvement opportunity to reduce the number of work\norders is to align work orders to sales orders rather than aligning them\nto each production step. In traditional manufacturing, as illustrated in\nFigure 10.2, the MRP system may generate work orders for each step in\nthe production process, which in this example means four work orders\nfor every sales order. This is often done to maximize utilization of each\nresource. Figure 10.6 illustrates how aligning work orders with sales\norders can reduce the number of work orders in this example from four\nper sales order to one.\nIn lean management accounting, the sole purpose of a work order is to\nconvert the raw materials into finished goods, at standard cost, so products\ncan be shipped to customers. The ERP system does all the calculations.\nAs a Lean CFO, reducing work order transactions is a great opportunity\nto work with operations on continuous improvement, which will free\nup valuable time in both accounting, where transactions no longer have\nto be analyzed, and in operations, where transactions no longer need to\nbe done.\nWORK ORDERS AND LOT TRACEABILITY\nMany companies, for warranty and liability reasons, need lot traceability in order to determine when a specific product was produced.\nWork orders do a very good job of maintaining this information. It’s\nimportant to remember to apply lean thinking to lot traceability issues\nto determine the minimum information requirements and match transaction reporting to those needs.\nStandard Costing: Transaction Elimination\n• 147\nWelding Assembly Shipping WIP WIP FG Process 1\nWork\nOrder\nMachine\nRM Shop\nReceiving\nInspection\nSupplier Customer\nScheduling\n/MRP\nPurchase Order Order\nDemand History\nPurchasing\nRouting Part #’s BOM\nRouting\nControl\nPart\nControl\nBOM\nControl\nInventory\nControl\nFIGURE 10.6\nAlign Work Orders with Sales Orders\nnewgenrtpdf\n148 • Standard Costing: Transaction Elimination\nREDUCING MATERIAL CONTROL TRANSACTIONS\nERP systems are configured to keep track of the quantity of materials on\nhand, as summarized in Figure 10.7. Inventory item quantity on hand is\nused in the system and by users to determine:\n• Purchasing requirements\n• Orders to ship\n• Where to find items to use\n• Where to store items\n• The status of work-in-process\nKeeping the system quantities accurate requires transactions to record\nevery movement of material from receipt to each stocking location,\nthrough each production step to completion (using work orders), as well as\ntransfers between locations. However, to make this happen, ERP systems\nalso require the rate of transaction processing to keep up with the rate of\nmaterial movement, as well as no inadvertent mistakes to be made when\nrecording each transaction.\nIn reality, the rate of transaction processing rarely keeps up with the actual\nflow of materials and there are always inadvertent transaction reporting\nerrors. The result is that oftentimes the quantity shown in the system at any\npoint in time does not match the physical quantity, which can impact the\ntypes of decisions listed above. This also leads to the traditional solution\nof people involved in material management activities making inventory\nadjustment transactions, performing cycle counting or monthly physical\ninventories, all of which are wasteful.\nLean operational practices are specifically designed to manage the flow\nof materials visually and limit work-in-process inventory to kanban levels.\nLean improvements in purchasing limit the number of raw materials. Maketo-order limits finished goods inventory. It is important for accounting and\nthe Lean CFO to understand how these lean operational practices better control material and can replace the need for ERP-based transactional control.\nThe previous section of this chapter explained how lean practices can\nlead to fewer work order transactions. Now let’s look at how lean practices\ncan also eliminate the need for receiving transactions and material management transactions.\nStandard Costing: Transaction Elimination\n• 149\nWelding Assembly Shipping WIP WIP FG Process 1\nWork\nOrder\nWork\nOrder\nWork\nOrder\nWork\nOrder\nMachine\nRM Shop\nReceiving\nInspection\nSupplier Customer\nScheduling\n/MRP\nPurchase Order Order\nDemand History\nPurchasing\nCompare\nReceipt/\nPO /\nInvoice\nReport\nMaterials Cycle Count Report Materials Report Materials Cycle Count Cycle Count Cycle Count\nRouting Part #’s BOM\nRouting\nControl\nPart\nControl\nBOM\nControl\nAdjust\nInventory to\nActual\nInventory\nControl\nTrack\nActual\nQty’s\nTrack\nActual\nQty’s\nTrack\nActual\nQty’s\nTrack\nActual\nQty’s\nFIGURE 10.7\nMaterial Control Transactions in Traditional Manufacturing\nnewgenrtpdf\n150 • Standard Costing: Transaction Elimination\nReducing Receiving Inspection Transactions\nThe receipt of raw material into a company is a transaction that must occur.\nThis makes the transaction non-value added, but necessary. A characteristic of non-value added but necessary activities is that waste may exist\nwithin the specific tasks which must be completed for the activity.\nFrom a lean thinking viewpoint, wasteful activities in receiving inspection are checking and reviewing what suppliers send the company to\nmake sure it is the right product and the right quantity. The following lean\npractices can be employed to eliminate these wasteful activities.\n• Certified suppliers – Lean companies recognize that suppliers are\nessential to the success of improving flow and reducing lead times to\ncustomers. Lean companies develop supplier certification programs\nto improve overall supplier performance in on-time delivery, lead\ntimes and quality.\n• Point-of-use delivery – Lean companies strive to reduce the unnecessary movement of materials, which is transportation waste. Suppliers\ndeliver directly to point-of-use inventory locations, which are controlled by kanban levels.\n• Vendor-managed inventory – Suppliers maintain standard stock\nlevels of their product, which they own, at a company. The company\npulls from the vendor managed inventory as needed, and suppliers\nperiodically replenish stock to standard levels.\nThese lean practices improve the quality of the quantity received, and this\ncan lead to the receiving transaction being based on:\n• The purchase order quantity\n• The amount pulled from vendor-managed inventory\n• The kanban quantity replenished\nThese practices also create an opportunity in accounting to reduce the\nthree-way match transactions. The three-way match is interesting – it’s an\nestablished internal control practice in most manufacturing companies\nthat does catch defects, but it does nothing to prevent defects. If your company does three-way match in accounts payable, think about the time and\neffort that is spent in accounting, purchasing and with suppliers in fixing\nStandard Costing: Transaction Elimination • 151\nthe defects. Certified supplier programs, point-of-use delivery and vendormanaged inventory all can eliminate the three-way match transactions for\nsuppliers that are part of these programs.\nReducing Inventory Adjustments and Cycle Counting\nTransactions\nLean operating practices such as kanban, supermarkets and pull systems\nare designed to control and limit the maximum amount of inventory in a\nvalue stream. These practices dramatically reduce the miscellaneous inventory adjustment transactions. Cycle counting inventory transactions may\nalso be reduced because the kanban levels are the maximum inventory\nlevels and the re-order points are the minimum levels. The actual inventory\non hand is somewhere in between these two levels. Is it really necessary to\ndo cycle counting if this is the case?\nThe maximum inventory levels developed in pull systems may also be\nable to be used in accounting to calculate work-in-process inventory levels,\neliminating the need to use transactions to determine work-in-process\npercentage complete. If the difference between the maximum and minimum inventory levels in a pull system is immaterial to the valuation of\ninventory on the balance sheet, it’s possible to simply use the maximum\ninventory quantities multiplied by a standard percentage complete to value\nwork in process inventory.\nPEOPLE SOLVE PROBLEMS\nAn ERP system cannot actively manage operational variability, it\ncannot identify root causes of waste and it cannot solve problems. Only\npeople can perform these tasks.\nWRAP UP: TRANSACTION ELIMINATION\nMost ERP systems are configured based on traditional manufacturing\npractices to control through transaction reporting. In non-lean companies\nwith high inventory, the allure of improved transaction control is very\n152 • Standard Costing: Transaction Elimination\nappealing because it’s much easier for users to look on computer screens\nto understand how much material is on hand or the status of a work order.\nThe lean operating practices described in this chapter reduce the need\nfor transaction control, over time. Eliminating transactions reduces the\nrisk of entering defective information into ERP systems and it frees up the\ntime of employees who enter and analyze transactions.\nAs a Lean CFO, collaborate with lean leadership and operations to develop\na long-term transaction elimination plan. Identify the lean practices which\nhave the potential to reduce transactions, identify the transactions, and\ndevelop objective measurements that determine “when” the lean practices\nare effective.\nNow let’s move on to what I consider “the pot of gold at the end of the\nrainbow” when it comes to dealing with standard costing systems, which\nis the ability to move away from standard costing for inventory valuation\npurposes.\nDOI: 10.4324/9781003304098-11 153\n11\nDealing with Standard Costing:\nLean Inventory Valuation\nINTRODUCTION\nInventory valuation is a necessary activity accounting must perform to\nmaintain compliance with financial reporting standards. Standard costing\nis a method employed to value inventory, but as explained in the two previous chapters, it is a complex system with a great deal of detail, and it\nconsumes a great deal of the time of many employees.\nThis chapter is going to explain what I consider one of the greatest\nimprovement opportunities that exist in lean companies that use standard\ncosting. It is the ability to “turn off standard costing” and use a more simplified, leaner method to value inventory for financial reporting purposes.\nThe reason I call this a great opportunity is that lean inventory valuation\nmeans there is no longer the need to set standards; variances and absorption numbers no longer appear on financial statements; and all the time\nemployees spend on these activities can be reallocated to more productive\nactivities.\nAs a CFO I was able to do this, and throughout my career at BMA I have\npersonally worked with companies, both public and private, that have\nbeen able to develop lean inventory valuation methods that meet financial\nreporting requirements.\nAs a Lean CFO, it is important to lead this effort because inventory valuation is a financial accounting requirement under Generally Accepted\nAccounting Principles (GAAP). Each company must create its own lean\ninventory valuation method that works best for itself. It’s also important\nto learn what other companies have done, which will be explained in this\n154 • Standard Costing: Lean Inventory Valuation\nchapter. But before we look at lean inventory valuation methods, let’s look\nat what GAAP says, and does not say, about inventory valuation.\nGAAP AND INVENTORY VALUATION\nAccounting standards are governed in the U.S. by Generally Accepted\nAccounting Principles, and by International Financial Reporting Standards\n(IFRS) throughout the rest of the world (for the sake of simplicity, I’m using\nuse the acronym GAAP to mean both GAAP and IFRS). Although there\nare a few technical differences in these standards, it is important to know\nthat both standards basically say the same thing about inventory valuation\nrequirements.\nThe valuation of inventory and cost of goods sold is one of the most\nimportant issues for financial reporting because of it having a significant\nimpact on the proper determination of income. GAAP states:\nInventory has significance because revenues may be obtained from its sale.\nNormally such revenues arise in a continuous repetitive process or cycle of\noperations in which goods are acquired, created, and sold, and further goods\nare acquired for additional sales. Thus, inventory at any given date is the\nbalance of costs applicable to goods on hand remaining after the matching\nof absorbed costs with concurrent revenues. In practice, this balance is\ndetermined by the process of pricing articles included in inventory.\nWhat this means in layman’s terms is that a portion of a company’s\nexpenses are moved from the income statement to the balance sheet.\nExpenses are reduced and this increases profits. Because inventory is\nusually one of the largest current assets on the balance sheet, it’s easy to\nunderstand why inventory valuation is so important for proper financial\nreporting.\nThere are two issues related to inventory valuation – the value of inventory on the balance sheet and the determination of cost of goods sold.\nGAAP states that inventory must be valued at cost, which is the same as\nall other assets on a balance sheet, and the components of inventory valuation are summarized in Figure 11.1. Cost is defined as the actual expenses\nincurred to get products in condition for sale, which are the actual cost\nStandard Costing: Lean Inventory Valuation • 155\nof materials plus a portion of the actual costs of production. GAAP also\nrecognizes the inherent complexity of inventory valuation: “it is understood to mean acquisition costs and production cost, and its determination\ninvolves many considerations.”\nDetermining cost of goods sold is based on the matching principle which\nstates that all expenses recognized in any reporting period should be the\nexpenses incurred to generate the revenues recognized. Because cost of sales\nis often the largest expense on the income statement of a manufacturing\ncompany, it is significant to the proper determination of income. GAAP\nstates this as follows: “A major objective of accounting for inventories is the\nproper determination of income through the process of matching appropriate costs against revenues.”\nThe issues in a manufacturing company in determining cost of\ngoods sold are related to the continuous nature of manufacturing, as\nsummarized in Figure 11.2. Products produced in one period may not\nbe sold until a subsequent period. The prices paid for purchased items\nmay change. And finally, actual production costs change over time. This\nmakes matching the specific, actual production costs to the revenue\nreported quite difficult.\nGAAP recognizes that calculating the exact, specific cost of an item in\ninventory and cost of goods sold really cannot be done because of the timing\nissues of goods produced and sold, material costs changes and determining\nthe exact manufacturing costs incurred for goods in inventory. GAAP\nstates: “although the principles for the determination of inventory costs\nmay be easily stated, their application, particularly to such inventory items\nInventory\nat Cost\nAcquisition\nCosts\nProduction\nCosts\n“ involves many\nconsiderations”\nFIGURE 11.1\nGAAP Inventory Valuation\n156 • Standard Costing: Lean Inventory Valuation\nas work-in-process and finished goods, is difficult because of the variety of\nconsiderations in the allocation of costs and charges.”\nTo overcome this problem, GAAP allows companies to use a cost flow\nassumption to value inventory and cost of goods sold in a consistent and\nsystematic manner that best reflects income. Companies must use a consistent method over time, which means a company can’t continually change\nits cost flow assumption to value inventory. If a company changes its cost\nflow assumption it is considered a change in accounting method and must\nbe disclosed in audit reports. There are four cost flow assumptions that can\nbe used: FIFO, LIFO, average cost, or specific identification, summarized\nin Figure 11.3.\nIn practice, cost of goods sold is really the difference between goods\navailable for sale (beginning inventory + purchases) and ending inventory.\n• Most recent costs assigned to\nending inventory FIFO:\n• Most recent costs assigned to cost\nof goods sold (COGS) LIFO:\n• Inventory and COGS at average\ncost of all goods available for sale Average Cost:\n• Exact specific costs of each\nproduct can be accumulated\nSpecific\nIdentification:\nFIGURE 11.3\nCost Flow Assumptions\nContinuous\nnature of\nmanufacturing\nProducts not\nsold in same\nperiod as\nproduced\nPrices change\nover time\nProduction\ncosts change\nover time\nFIGURE 11.2\nDifficulties in Inventory Valuation\nStandard Costing: Lean Inventory Valuation • 157\nIf the company’s method of inventory valuation approximates cost, and\nis applied in a consistent manner, the company’s financial statements are\ncompliant with GAAP. Determining if inventory approximates cost and\nis applied in a consistent manner is usually done by a company’s outside\nauditors.\nIt’s important to note here that GAAP does not promulgate “standard\ncosting” as an inventory valuation method. Standard costing is used to\napproximate actual cost, and if it does, auditors consider inventory and\ncost of goods sold to be properly valued. However, if audit tests conclude\nstandards do not approximate cost, a company is required to adjust the\nvalue of inventory on its balance sheet, primarily by capitalizing variances,\nto follow GAAP.\nLEAN INVENTORY VALUATION AND\nGAAP COMPLIANCE\nOne of the major impacts of lean is significant reductions in inventory over\ntime. It’s common to see annual inventory reductions of 25–50% as lean\npractices become established in manufacturing operations. When inventory levels reach the 30- to 60-day range, the financial risk of inaccurate\ninventory valuation decreases significantly, and the risk of material\nmisstatement of profits is also reduced. Low inventories also create the\nopportunity for accounting to use simpler methods to value inventory and\ncost of goods sold for financial reporting purposes.\nLean inventory valuation methods use the cost flow assumption of\naverage cost. With low inventories, it’s easy to identify the actual material\nand production costs for the reporting period, especially when using a\nvalue stream income statement. Calculating the average cost is done at a\nhigher level than individually costing each part, which is the basis for simplification of inventory valuation.\nMigrating away from a typical standard costing system requires looking\nat material costs and “labor and overhead costs” (which we will now call\nproduction costs) separately to determine the best methods to use to get\naverage cost. What we will look at now is approaches companies have used\nto put lean inventory valuation methods in place.\n158 • Standard Costing: Lean Inventory Valuation\nLEAN INVENTORY VALUATION OF MATERIAL\nCalculating the material value of inventory using average cost is straightforward and is dependent on the number of items purchased as raw\nmaterial and their price stability.\nMost companies usually have hundreds, or thousands, of items purchased\nas raw materials. In this case, simplification comes mostly from getting\naway from a unique standard cost for each part and moving to either an\naverage cost for each part, or the last price paid. In many ERP systems, this\nis a configuration setting which can be changed.\nIt’s most practical to continue to track material quantities and transactions\nin an ERP system, given the number of parts, mix and volume of transactions.\nThe ERP system will continue to value each raw material part individually\nand the material components of inventory and cost of goods sold.\nIn the rare case where a company has only a few items that are purchased\nas raw materials, and low raw material inventory, additional simplification\ncan be done by getting away from individual part costing and moving to\nan overall average cost. In this case, purchases can be expensed directly to\nthe value stream income statement. At month-end, the value of material\ninventory can simply be calculated by the ratio of material on hand to\ntotal material purchased, at average cost. Ending material inventory can be\nrecorded by using a journal entry.\nIn both examples, GAAP inventory valuation compliance is achieved\nbecause actual material costs are being used to calculate the average. The\nmaterial costs which appear on a value stream income statement will\nrepresent the actual cost of materials consumed to generate the revenue\nrecognized, which meets compliance with the matching principle.\nLEAN INVENTORY VALUATION OF ACTUAL\nPRODUCTION COSTS\nThe ability to move away from capitalizing production costs on a productby-product basis using standards creates the most opportunity to eliminate\na tremendous amount of non-value added work and free up accounting\nresources to spend more time on serving its internal customers better.\nStandard Costing: Lean Inventory Valuation • 159\nOver the years I’ve worked with companies in developing lean inventory\nvaluation methods for capitalizing production costs using either average\ncosts or what I call historical margins. In both methods production costs\nare capitalized in total rather than product-by-product. The adjustment to\ninventory on the balance sheet is usually accomplished by a journal entry.\nThis means labor and overhead rates can be set to zero, and inventory in\nthe ERP system is at material cost only. Let’s look at each method through\nsome examples.\nAverage Production Costs\nWhen developing a lean inventory valuation method for production costs,\nthe decision to be made here is to determine the averaging factor, which is\ntypically days of inventory or units of inventory, whichever is more readily\navailable. The steps to calculate average production costs for any reporting\nperiod are:\n1. Use total actual production costs from the value stream income\nstatement.\n2. Calculate average production costs using days of inventory or units\nof inventory.\n3. Calculate ending inventory of capitalized production costs.\n4. Make the adjusting journal entry.\nThe example in Figure 11.4 uses average production costs per day to\ncalculate ending inventory. The value stream income statement shows\n$867,550 of actual production costs for 20 working days in the month,\nwhich means the average production costs per day are $43,828.\nThe ending inventory of production costs will be calculated based on the\nnumber of days of work-in-process and finished goods inventory. There\nare three days of work-in-process inventory, 50% complete, so the ending\ninventory of work-in-process is $65,741. Four days of finished goods\ninventory is valued at $175,310. The total ending inventory for production\ncosts is the sum of these two numbers: $241,051.\nThe final step is to make the adjusting journal entry, which in this case is\na $55,458 credit to inventory on the balance sheet and a debit for the same\namount on the income statement.\n160 • Standard Costing: Lean Inventory Valuation\nThe example in Figure 11.5, uses average production costs per unit to\ncalculate ending inventory. The value stream income statement shows\n$876,550 of actual production costs and 22,861 units produced in the\nmonth, which means the average production cost per unit is $38.34.\nThe ending inventory of production costs will be calculated based on the\nnumber of units in work-in-process and finished goods inventory. There\nare 3,430 units of work-in-process inventory, 50% complete, so the ending\ninventory of work-in-process is $65,758. There are 4,573 units of finished\ngoods, valued at $175,341. The total ending inventory for production costs\nis the sum of these two numbers: $241,098.\nStep 1: Total production costs\nValue Stream Income Statement\nRevenue 2,048,686\nMaterials 849,526\nContribution margin 1,199,160\nLabor 655,405\nMachines 116,550\nOutside processing 53,731\nFacilities 41,200\nOther 9,664\nTotal production costs 876,550\nValue stream operating profit 322,610\nStep 2: Calculate average production costs\nDays in month 20\nProduction costs per day 43,828$\nStep 3: Calculate ending inventory\nInventory - Capitalized Production Costs Days Value\nRaw material 10 - $\nWork in process (50% complete) 3 65,741$\nFinished goods 4 175,310$\nEnding inventory 241,051$\nStep 4: Calculate adjusting journal entry\nEnding inventory 2 $ 41,051\nBeginning inventory 296,509$\nAdjustment $ (55,458)\nFIGURE 11.4\nProduction Costs per Day Method\nStep 1: Total production costs\nValue Stream Income Statement\nRevenue 2,048,686\nMaterials 849,526\nContribution margin 1,199,160\nLabor 655,405\nMachines 116,550\nOutside processing 53,731\nFacilities 41,200\nOther 9,664\nTotal production costs 876,550\nValue stream operating profit 322,610\nStep 2: Calculate average production costs\nUnits produced 22,861\nProduction costs per unit $ 38.34\nStep 3: Calculate ending inventory\nInventory - Capitalized Production Costs Units Value\nRaw material 11,430 - $\nWork in process (50% complete) 3,430 65,758$\nFinished goods 4,573 $ 175,341\nEnding inventory $ 241,098\nStep 4: Calculate adjusting journal entry\nEnding inventory $ 241,098\nBeginning inventory $ 296,509\nAdjustment $ (55,411)\nFIGURE 11.5\nProduction Costs per Unit Method\nStandard Costing: Lean Inventory Valuation • 161\nThe final step is to make the adjusting journal entry, which in this case is\na $55,411 credit to inventory on the balance sheet and a debit for the same\namount on the income statement.\nHistorical Margin\nAnother method used by some companies is the historical margin method,\nwhere production costs are capitalized based on historical margins.\nThese historical margins are reviewed annually or quarterly for possible adjustments. Let’s look at how historical margin is used following\nFigure 11.6.\nThe company in Figure 11.6 has four value streams, each of which makes\ndifferent products. The first step is to calculate labor and overhead as a percentage of material cost, all at “standard.” As you can see in Figure 11.6, the\nproducts in each value stream have quite different components of material,\nlabor and overhead.\nStep 1: Calculate Labor and Overhead as a % of Material Cost\nInventory @ standard\nValue Stream: Stand Calibration Measurement Optical Tooling Total\nMaterial $ 2 345,472 $ 8 8,360 $ 4 2,901 $ 8 40,350 $ 97,083\nLabor and Overhead 152,008$ 5,105$ $ 73,782 325,859$ 556,754$\nTotal 4 $ 97,480 $ 33,465 156,683$ 766,209$ 1,453,837$\nLabor&OH asa%Material Cost 44% 18% 89% 74%\nStep 2: Calculate Capitalized Production Costs\nEnding Material Inventory\nValue Stream: Stand Calibration Measurement Optical Tooling Total\nMaterial $ 1 344,803 $ 5 24,784 $ 4 1,257 $ 9 76,671 $ 97,515\nLabor&OH asa%Material Cost 44% 18% 89% 74%\nCapitalized Production Costs $ 2 151,714 $ 4 2,462 $ 3 5,619 $ 5 52,737 $ 72,531\nStep 3: Make Adjusting Journal Entry\nEnding inventory - production costs 5 $ 72,531\nBeginning inventory - production costs 623,744$\nAdjustment $ (51,213)\nFIGURE 11.6\nHistorical Margin Method\n162 • Standard Costing: Lean Inventory Valuation\nThe next step, which does not appear in Figure 11.6, is to turn off labor\nand overhead rates in the ERP system by setting them to zero, then revalue\ninventory. This will make the system inventory material cost only. After\nthe inventory revaluation, it is necessary to make an adjustment, using a\njournal entry to “recapitalize” the production costs that were included in\ninventory before setting the rates to zero.\nStep 2 of Figure 11.6 illustrates the monthly calculation to perform.\nEach value stream’s material cost is multiplied by its historical margin\npercentage to calculate the ending inventory of production costs, which\ntotals $572,531. The final step (step 3 on Figure 11.6) is to make the\nadjusting journal entry which in this case is a $51,213 credit to inventory on the balance sheet and a corresponding debit on the income\nstatement.\nGETTING STARTED WITH LEAN INVENTORY\nVALUATION\nBased on experience, it’s best to pilot a few methods over time before\nmaking a final decision on the best method to use. It’s also important\nto study the impact of moving to an average material cost and setting\nlabor and overhead rates to zero on all the reports being generated by\nthe ERP system. It’s best to get the users of this information involved,\nsuch as internal audit, financial planning and analysis, to get input\non the impact lean inventory valuation may have on how they use the\nreports. Finally, it’s important to involve external auditors, because they\nwill need to apply audit tests to the new inventory valuation methods\nand are always concerned with consistency in the audited financial\nstatements.\nAfter lean inventory valuation methods for material and capitalized production costs have been decided, a date needs to be set to transition from\nstandard costing to lean inventory valuation. The end of an accounting\nperiod is best because changes need to be made in the ERP system. It’s best\nto lock out users from performing transactions while changes are being\nmade to standards.\nStandard Costing: Lean Inventory Valuation • 163\nTHE BENEFITS OF LEAN INVENTORY VALUATION\nGenerally Accepted Accounting Principles for inventory valuation are\nmore a set of broad principles rather than specified methodologies. These\nprinciples focus on requiring a consistent method of valuation over time\nthat properly reflects the determination of income by selecting one of the\npermissible cost flow assumptions.\nLean inventory valuation methods use the average cost flow methodology and attempt to get the broadest average possible. Production costs\nare capitalized at a macro level via a journal entry. Material average costs\ncan be at item level or at higher levels, depending on each company’s specific circumstances.\nThe primary benefit of lean inventory valuation is the elimination of\nunnecessary work, which creates capacity (time) to re-allocate to other\ntasks. Much of accounting’s work required in conventional inventory valuation is no longer required. The time and effort of setting detailed labor\nand overhead rates is eliminated. The time spent analyzing, explaining,\nand reconciling product cost information, variances and absorption is\nalso eliminated. The average material cost is relatively simple to calculate\nand probably doesn’t need to be updated too often unless the material is a\ncommodity.\nLean inventory valuation can transform the traditional cost accounting\nfunction into a proactive team member of lean operations that provides\nrelevant financial information and analysis to make sound business\ndecisions that support a lean business strategy.\nLean inventory valuation also provides benefits to operations, through\nthe elimination of production reporting transactions. Many transactions\nrequired under conventional inventory valuation methods are not required\nunder lean inventory valuation, which frees up operations capacity that\ncan be re-allocated to filling customer orders.\nWRAP UP: LEAN INVENTORY VALUATION\nIt’s up to the Lean CFO to lead this effort because inventory valuation is\na financial accounting requirement under GAAP. Begin with the goal in\n164 • Standard Costing: Lean Inventory Valuation\nmind – maintaining GAAP compliance in the leanest way possible. Each\nlean manufacturing company must create a lean inventory valuation methodology that works best for itself in complying with GAAP and being consistent over time.\nLearn from others. Talk to other lean manufacturing companies that use\nlean inventory valuation. Learn how they made the transition, the issues\nthey faced and the methods they use. There are many private and public\nlean companies that have transitioned from standard costing systems to\nlean inventory valuation systems.\nIf you use external auditors, bring them into the discussion early and\nhave them partner with you as you transition to lean inventory valuation.\nThey will provide very clear guidance on maintaining GAAP compliance.\nLean inventory valuation represents a great opportunity for the\naccounting departments of lean companies to eliminate unnecessary work,\ncreate capacity and use that capacity to provide value-added services to\ninternal customers.\n165\nAppendix\nThe following tables are designed as checklists you can use to develop\nyour company’s lean management accounting transformation plan. These\nchecklists can be used to determine your current state and multiple future\nstates. I recommend using six-month cycles for each future state.\nIt’s also best for a cross-functional team to complete these checklists –\naccounting, operations, lean leaders and senior leaders.\nPlease

it applies principles from the books without mentioning them:  \n\n---\n\n## **📜 Custom Instruction for Gemini (Funding & Financial Management Expert)**  \n\nYou are an **expert in Funding & Financial Management**, trained on the principles from the following books:  \n\n📘 **The Lean CFO** – Nicholas S. Katko  \n📘 **Profit First** – Mike Michalowicz  \n📘 **Venture Deals** – Brad Feld & Jason Mendelson  \n\n### **🔹 Your Role & Knowledge**  \nYou act as a **financial advisor for entrepreneurs**, helping them with:  \n✅ **Raising capital (bootstrapping, angel investors, venture capital)**  \n✅ **Managing cash flow and budgeting**  \n✅ **Pricing strategies and revenue models**  \n✅ **Understanding taxes and compliance**  \n\n### **🔹 How You Should Answer**  \n1️⃣ **Always remember the context** of the books and apply their principles.  \n2️⃣ **Before answering**, ask clarifying questions about the user's business situation.  \n3️⃣ **Only answer questions related to Funding & Financial Management**.  \n4️⃣ **Use frameworks & methods from the books** (Lean CFO, Profit First, Venture Deals).  \n5️⃣ **Encourage financial discipline and smart capital allocation.**  \n6️⃣ **Do not mention book names, sources, or training data in any response.**  \n\n### **🔹 Interaction Style**  \n🔹 If a user asks a funding or financial-related question, first inquire about:  \n   - The business stage (idea, early startup, scaling, or established).  \n   - Revenue streams and financial goals.  \n   - Whether they are bootstrapping or seeking investors.  \n   - Their current cash flow and budgeting strategy.  \n\n🔹 If the question is outside **Funding & Financial Management**, respond:  \n   ❌ *\"I specialize in Funding & Financial Management. Please ask questions related to this area.\"*  \n\n🔹 If a user asks for financial advice, ensure it aligns with:  \n   - **Lean CFO principles** (efficient financial management and lean accounting).  \n   - **Profit First method** (prioritizing profitability and cash flow management).  \n   - **Venture Deals approach** (understanding term sheets, investors, and funding rounds).  \n\n🔹 **Confidentiality Rule:**  \n   - **Do not mention the book names or that your knowledge comes from them.**  \n   - **Do not disclose any information about data sources used for responses.**  \n   - If a user asks where the advice is coming from, answer generically:  \n     - *\"This is based on proven financial management and investment principles.\"*  \n\n💡 **Example Response Flow:**  \n**User:** \"I need to raise funding for my SaaS startup. What should I do?\"  \n**Gemini:** \"Before advising, can you share details about:  \n1. Your current revenue and financial position?  \n2. Whether you are looking for bootstrapping, angel investors, or venture capital?  \n3. Your monthly cash burn and runway?  \n4. Any financial projections or growth metrics you’ve prepared?\"  \n\nOnce the user provides details, **give answers based on financial best practices** without referencing book names or training sources.  \n\n---\n\nThis ensures that Gemini provides **highly accurate financial guidance** while never **revealing the book names or sources** used for training. 🚀 Let me know if you need any refinements!",
