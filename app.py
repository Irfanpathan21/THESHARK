In the intervening 300\nyears, companies managed to start, build and grow without formally trained\nexecutives. By the 20\nth century, the complexity of modern corporations\ndemanded a cadre of executives trained to administer large companies. In\n1908, Harvard awarded the first master of business administration (MBA)\ndegree to fill the need to bring professional education standards to big\nbusiness. The MBA curriculum standardized and codified the essential\nelements an operating executive in a modern company needed to know: cost\naccounting, strategy, finance, product management, engineering, personnel\nmanagement and operations.\nFormal management tools are about 100 years old.\nFast-forward to the mid-20\nth century. The pairing of venture capital and\nstartup entrepreneurship emerged in its modern form, and the startup industry\nthey fostered has been exploding ever since. Yet for the past 50 years, finding\nthe successful formula for repeatable startup success has remained a black art.\nFounders have continually struggled with and adapted the “big business”\ntools, rules and processes taught in business schools and suggested by their\ninvestors. Investors have been shocked when startups failed to execute “the\nplan,” never admitting to the entrepreneurs that no startup executes to its\nbusiness plan. Today, after half a century of practice, we know unequivocally\nthat the traditional MBA curriculum for running large companies like IBM,\nGM and Boeing does not work in startups. In fact, it’s toxic.\nWith the benefit of hindsight, entrepreneurs now understand the\nproblem, namely that startups are not simply smaller versions of large\ncompanies. Companies execute business models where customers, their\nproblems, and necessary product features are all “knowns.” In sharp contrast,\nstartups operate in “search” mode, seeking a repeatable and profitable\nbusiness model. The search for a business model requires dramatically\ndifferent rules, roadmaps, skill sets, and tools in order to minimize risk and\noptimize chances for success.\nBy the beginning of the 21\nst century, entrepreneurs, led by web and\nmobile startups, began to seek and develop their own management tools.\nNow, a decade later, a radically different set of startup tools has emerged,\ndistinct from those used in large companies but as comprehensive as the\ntraditional “MBA Handbook.” The result is the emerging “science of\nentrepreneurial management.” My first book, The Four Steps to the\nEpiphany, was one of its first texts. It recognized that the classic books about\nlarge-company management were ill-suited for early-stage ventures. It\noffered a reexamination of the existing product-introduction process and\ndelineated a radically different method that brings customers and their needs\nheadfirst into the process long before the launch.\nWe are building the first management tools\nspecifically for startups.\nAt the time I wrote it, the book was my proposed methodology for\ngetting startups right. But just as it was published, agile engineering became\nthe preferred product-development method. This iterative and incremental\nmethod created a need and a demand for a parallel process to provide rapid\nand continual customer feedback. The Customer Development process I\narticulated in The Four Steps fit that need perfectly.\nOver the past decade, thousands of scientists, engineers and MBAs in\nmy classes at Stanford’s engineering school and U.C. Berkeley’s Haas\nSchool of Business—plus those sponsored by the National Science\nFoundation—have discussed, deployed, assessed and enhanced the Customer\nDevelopment process. It has since been implemented by tens of thousands of\nentrepreneurs, engineers, and investors worldwide.\nWhile the fundamental, powerful “Four Steps” remain at its core, this\nbook is far more than a second edition. Nearly every step in the process, and\nin fact the entire approach, have been enhanced and refined based on a\ndecade of Customer Development experience.\nCustomer development is paired with agile product\ndevelopment.\nEven more gratifying: now, a decade later, multiple books and authors,\nare filling shelves in the newly created section for the strategy and science of\nentrepreneurship. Some of the other areas in this emerging field of\nentrepreneurial management are:\nagile development, an incremental and interactive approach to\nengineering that enables product or service development to iterate and\npivot to customer and market feedback\nbusiness model design, which replaces static business plans with a ninebox map of the key elements that make up a company\ncreativity and innovation tools for creating and fostering winning ideas\nthe Lean Startup, an intersection of customer and agile development\nlean user interface design to improve web/mobile interfaces and\nconversion rates\nventure and entrepreneurial finance, to attract and manage funds that\nfuel the innovation\nNo one book, including this one, offers a complete roadmap or all the\nanswers for entrepreneurs. Yet together, the texts in the entrepreneurial\nmanagement science library offer entrepreneurs guidance where none existed\nbefore. Startups, driven by potential markets measured in billions of people,\nwill use this body of knowledge to test, refine and scale their ideas far faster\nand more affordably than ever.\nNo one book, including this one, offers a complete\nroadmap...\nMy co-author Bob and I hope books like this one help speed the startup\nrevolution and enhance its success—and yours.\nSteve Blank\nPescadero, Calif., March 2012\nWho Is This Book For?\nTHIS BOOK IS FOR ALL ENTREPRENEURS and uses the term startup literally\nhundreds of times. But what exactly is a startup? A startup is not a smaller\nversion of a large company. A startup is a temporary organization in search\nof a scalable, repeatable, profitable business model. At the outset, the startup\nbusiness model is a canvas covered with ideas and guesses, but it has no\ncustomers and minimal customer knowledge.\nBut we’ve only defined the words startup, entrepreneur, and innovation\nhalfway. These words mean different things in Silicon Valley, on Main\nStreet, and in Corporate America. While each type of startup is distinct, this\nbook offers guidance for each one.\nA startup is a temporary organization in search of a\nscalable, repeatable, profitable business model.\nSmall Business Entrepreneurship: In the United States, the majority of\nentrepreneurs and startups are found among 5.9 million small businesses that\nmake up 99.7 percent of all U.S. companies and employ 50 percent of all\nnongovernment workers. These are often service-oriented businesses like\ndrycleaners, gas stations and convenience stores, where entrepreneurs define\nsuccess as paying the owners well and making a profit, and they seldom\naspire to take over an industry or build a $100 million business.\nScalable startups are the work of traditional technology entrepreneurs.\nThese entrepreneurs start a company believing their vision will change the\nworld and result in a company with hundreds of millions if not billions of\ndollars in sales. The early days of a scalable startup are about the search for a\nrepeatable and scalable business model. Scale requires external venturecapital investment in the tens of millions to fuel rapid expansion. Scalable\nstartups tend to cluster in technology centers such as Silicon Valley,\nShanghai, New York, Bangalore, and Israel and make up a small percentage\nof entrepreneurs, but their outsize return potential attracts almost all the risk\ncapital (and press).\nScalable Startup (Figure i.1)\n“Buyable” startups are a new phenomenon. With the extremely low cost of\ndeveloping web/mobile apps, startups can literally fund themselves on\nfounders’ credit cards and raise small amounts of risk capital, usually less\nthan $1 million. These startups (and their investors) are happy to be acquired\nfor $5 million to $50 million, purchased by larger companies often to acquire\nthe talent as much as the business itself.\nLarge Company Entrepreneurship: Large companies have finite life\ncycles. Most grow by offering new products that are variants of their core\nproducts (an approach known as sustaining innovation). They may also turn\nto disruptive innovation, attempting to introduce new products into new\nmarkets with new customers. Ironically, large companies’ size and culture\nmake disruptive innovation (really an effort to launch a scalable startup inside\na big company) extremely difficult to execute.\n...large companies’ size and culture make disruptive\ninnovation extremely difficult.\nSocial entrepreneurs build innovative nonprofits to change the world.\nCustomer Development provides them a scorecard for assessing scalability,\nasset leverage, return on investment and growth metrics. These\nentrepreneurial ventures seek solutions rather than profits and happen on\nevery continent in areas as diverse as water, agriculture, health, and\nmicrofinance.\nWhile the Customer Development process helps scalable startups the\nmost, each of these five startup types has entrepreneurship and innovation at\nits heart. And each improves its chances for finding the right path to success\nthrough the use of Customer Development.\nWho Is This Book Not For?\nThere are cases where using the Customer Development methodology and\nthis book is inappropriate.\nEarly-stage ventures fall into two types: those with customer/market risk\nand those with invention risk.\nMarkets with invention risk are those where it’s questionable whether\nthe technology can ever be made to work, but if it does, customers will\nbeat a path to the company’s door. (Think life sciences and cure for\ncancer.)\nMarkets with customer/market risk are those where the unknown is\nwhether customers will adopt the product.\nFor companies building web-based products, product development may\nbe difficult, but with enough time and iteration, Engineering will eventually\nconverge on a solution and ship a functional product—it’s engineering, not\ninvention. The real risk is in whether there is a customer and a market for the\nproduct as spec’ed. In these markets it’s all about customer/market risk.\nThere’s a whole other set of markets where the risk is truly invention.\nThese are markets where it may take five or even 10 years to get a product\nout of the lab and into production (e.g., biotech). Whether it will eventually\nwork, no one knows, but the payoff can be so large that investors will take\nthe risk. In these markets it’s all about invention risk.\nStartups solve customer and market risk by reading\nthis book.\nA third type of market has both invention and market risk. For example,\ncomplex new semiconductor architectures mean you may not know if the\nchip performs as well as you thought until you get first silicon. But then,\nbecause there might be entrenched competitors and your concept is radically\nnew, you still need to invest in the Customer Development process to learn\nhow to get design wins from companies that may be happy with their existing\nvendors.\nStartups solve invention risk by using simulation tools (computational\nfluid dynamics, finite element analysis, etc.). Startups solve customer and\nmarket risk by reading this book. When the issues are customer acceptance\nand market adoption, this book shows the path.\nIntroduction\nA legendary hero is usually the founder of something—the founder of a\nnew age, the founder of a new religion, the founder of a new city, the\nfounder of a new way of life. In order to found something new, one has\nto leave the old and go on a quest of the seed idea, a germinal idea that\nwill have the potential of bringing forth that new thing.\n— Joseph Campbell, The Hero with a Thousand Faces\nJOSEPH CAMPBELL POPULARIZED THE NOTION of an archetypal “hero’s\njourney,” a pattern that recurs in the mythologies and religions of cultures\naround the world. From Moses and the burning bush to Luke Skywalker’s\nmeeting Obi-wan Kenobi, the journey always begins with a hero who hears a\ncalling to a quest. At the outset of the voyage, the path is unclear and no end\nis in sight. Each hero meets a unique set of obstacles, but Campbell’s keen\ninsight was that the outline of these stories is always the same. There are not\na thousand different heroes but one hero with a thousand faces.\nThe hero’s journey is an apt way to think of startups. All new companies\nand new products begin with a vision—a hope for what could be and a goal\nfew others can see. It’s this bright and burning founder’s vision that\ndifferentiates an entrepreneur from a big-company CEO and separates\nstartups from existing businesses.\nFounding entrepreneurs are out to make their vision and business real.\nTo succeed, they must abandon the status quo, recruit a team that shares their\nvision, and strike out together on what appears to be a new path, often\nshrouded in uncertainty, fear and doubt. Obstacles, hardships and potential\ndisaster lie ahead, and their journey to success tests more than financial\nresources—it tests their stamina, agility, and courage.\nTake a new path, often shrouded in uncertainty,\nfear, and doubt.\nEvery entrepreneur is certain his or her journey is unique. Each travels\ndown the startup path without a roadmap and believes that no model or\ntemplate could possibly apply. What makes some startups successful while\nothers sell off the furniture often seems like luck. But it isn’t. As Campbell\nsuggests, the outline is always the same. The path to startup success is welltraveled and well-understood. There is a true and repeatable path to success.\nThis book charts that path.\nA Repeatable Path\nIn the last quarter of the 20\nth century, startups thought they knew the correct\npath for the startup journey. They adopted a methodology for product\ndevelopment, launch, and life-cycle management almost identical to the\nprocesses taught in business schools for use in large companies. These\nprocesses provide detailed business plans, checkpoints and goals for every\nstep toward getting a product out the door—sizing markets, estimating sales,\ndeveloping marketing-requirements documents, prioritizing product features.\nYet at the end of the day, even with all these processes, the embarrassing fact\nis that in companies large and small, established corporate giants as well as\nnew startups, more than nine of 10 new products fail. It’s true in every\nproduct category—high-tech or low, online or off, consumer or business—\nwell-funded or not.\nEven after decades of similar failures, investors are always surprised\nwhen a new venture fails to execute its business “plan.” And still they\ncontinue to rely on the same product-introduction processes.\nWe now know what the problem is. Startups have been using tools\nappropriate for executing a known business. But startups are all about\nunknowns. To find the path to build a winning startup, entrepreneurs must try\na new way:\nWinners throw out the traditional product management and introduction\nprocesses they learned at existing companies. Instead, they combine agile\nengineering and Customer Development to iteratively build, test and search\nfor a business model, turning unknowns into knowns.\nWinners also recognize their startup “vision” as a series of untested\nhypotheses in need of “customer proof.” They relentlessly test for insights,\nand they course-correct in days or weeks, not months or years, to preserve\ncash and eliminate time wasted on building features and products that\ncustomers don’t want.\nWinners recognize their startup is a series of\nuntested hypotheses.\nLosers blindly execute a rigid product management and introduction\nmethodology. They assume that the founder’s vision drives the business\nstrategy and product development plans and that all they need to do is to raise\nfunds for execution.\nFounders, not employees, must search for a business model. The best\nway to search is for the founders themselves to get out of the building to gain\na deep, personal, firsthand understanding of their potential customers’ needs\nbefore locking into a specific path and precise product specs. That’s the\ndifference between winners and losers. It’s also the Customer Development\nprocess detailed in this book.\nWhy a Second Decade?\nStartups have now been using Customer Development for a decade, since the\ninitial publication of The Four Steps to the Epiphany. If this is your first\ncontact with the Four Steps, welcome aboard. For the tens of thousands\nwho’ve embraced that first version, The Startup Owner’s Manual offers a\ngreat deal more. The first version assumed startups were high-tech ventures\nin Silicon Valley selling products through a physical sales channel and\naiming to be billion-dollar businesses. A lot has happened in 10 years, and\nthis version embraces those changes. For example:\nBits: The Second Industrial Revolution\nFor thousands of years after the invention of the wheel, a product was a\nphysical object one could touch, such as food, cars, planes, books, and\nhousehold goods. These physical products reached customers via a physical\nsales channel: salespeople visiting customers, or customers visiting stores.\nFigure i.2 shows this intersection of physical products sold through a\nphysical channel.\nPhysical Products Sold Through a Physical Channel (Figure i.2)\nOne of the breakthroughs in commerce was the invention of products\nthat were ideas or promises that didn’t exist in physical form, such as life and\nhealth insurance, stocks and bonds, and commodity futures.\nIn the 1970s, software began to be sold as a product unbundled from any\nparticular computer. The ability to purchase bits was a new concept. By\nthemselves the bits were useless, but when combined with a computer in the\nform of software applications, bits solved problems or amused people (word\nprocessing, balancing checkbooks, game play). These software applications\nand entertainment, all in the form of bits, were sold to consumers through\nspecialized retail computer stores, a physical channel.\nSoftware Products Sold Through Physical Channels (Figure i.3)\nStill other software applications were designed to solve problems\ncompanies had (database access, manufacturing automation, sales\nautomation), and added the upper right box to Figure i.3, Software Products\nSold Through Physical Channels.\nAs the Internet created a new form of sales channel, a new class of\ncompany emerged with the value proposition to sell physical products over\nthe Internet. Amazon, Zappos, Dell, and a whole raft of other e-commerce\ncompanies filled a new niche: physical products sold via a web channel. This\nnew sales channel created massive disruption in the existing world of\nphysical distribution, as book and music retailers perhaps know best of all.\nPhysical Products in Web/Mobile Channels (Figure i.4)\nOver the past decade a new class of product has emerged, where BOTH\nthe product and the channel are bits (see Figure i.5). Startups can now be\nbuilt for thousands rather than millions of dollars and in weeks rather than\nyears. As a result, the number of startups founded each year has exploded.\nNew applications such as social networks that duplicate the socialization we\nonce had face-to-face are being mediated via machine. Search engines that\nscour the web, such as Google and Bing, exist only in bits, in a web/mobile\nchannel.\nMore important, entire industries that started by selling physical\nproducts in physical locations have begun their migration to bits sold over the\nInternet. Originally, people sold books, music, videos, movies, travel, and\nstocks and bonds either face-to-face or in storefronts. Those channels are\neither radically transformed or disappearing as physical products turn into\nbits.\nSoftware Products In Web/Mobile Channels (Figure i.5)\nSpeed, Time and Iterations: the “Second Industrial\nRevolution”\nRegardless of the business, any enterprise focused on the bottom righthand\nbox in Figure i.2—Physical Goods Sold through a Physical Channel—has\ndiscovered over the past decade that the old rules and tools for physical\nbusinesses and channels no longer apply. They’ve learned that the closer a\ncompany gets to a web/mobile channel and a web/mobile product, the faster\nit can change, test and optimize both product and offer. They need a new\nprocess to quickly adapt to the new freedoms a web/mobile channel and\nproduct allow, and they’ve found it in Customer Development.\nThe Customer Development process gathers customer feedback about\nproduct, channel, price, and positioning, all of which can be modified and\ntested in near-real time, and uses it as immediate feedback to iterate and\noptimize. As a result, web/mobile channel startups can move forward at\n“Internet speed,” an impossibility with physical distribution channels and\nproducts.\nA mere decade ago, getting feedback on the features of a video game\nrequired recruiting focus groups to come in and play the game while being\nobserved through one-way mirrors. Today, companies like Zynga test and\ntune the features of their online games in days. Are sales slow because the\ngame is too hard? You can adjust the scoring or other game variables and\nchange the product itself quicker than you can say touchdown.\nCustomer Development is the process to organize\nthe search for the business model.\nTheoretically, when startups’ products and channels are bits, they can\ngather and act on information 100 times faster than companies delivering\nphysical goods via physical sales channels (10 times the number of iterative\nlearning cycles, each using only 10 percent of the cash.) In fact, companies\nlike Facebook, Google, Groupon, and Zynga grew faster in a decade than\nmost industrial corporations grew in the 20\nth century. That’s why we call it\nthe Second Industrial Revolution.\nThe Four Steps: A New Path\nThe core of Customer Development is blissfully simple: Products developed\nby founders who get out in front of customers early and often, win. Products\nhanded off to sales and marketing organizations that are only tangentially\ninvolved in the new-product development process will lose. There are no\nfacts inside your building, so get the heck outside. Getting out of the building\nmeans acquiring a deep understanding of customer needs and combining that\nknowledge with incremental and iterative product development. The mix of\nCustomer Development and Agile engineering dramatically increases the\nodds of new product and company success, while reducing the need for\nupfront cash and eliminating wasted time, energy, money and effort.\nThere are no facts inside your building, so get the\nheck outside.\nCustomer Development recognizes the startup’s mission as a relentless\nsearch to refine its vision and idea, and to make changes in every aspect of\nthe business invalidated during the search process. An entrepreneur seeks to\ntest a series of unproven hypotheses (guesses) about a startup’s business\nmodel: who the customers are, what the product features should be, and how\nthis scales into a hugely successful company. Customer Development\nrecognizes a startup is a temporary organization built to search for the\nanswers to what makes a repeatable and scalable business model. Customer\nDevelopment is the process to organize that search.\nCHAPTER 1\nThe Path to Disaster: A Startup Is Not a\nSmall Version of a Big Company\nThe definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and\nexpecting different results.\n—Albert Einstein\nWHILE THIS STORY IS OLD, ITS LESSONS are timeless. In the heyday of the dotcom bubble at the end of the 20\nth century, Webvan stood out as one of the\nmost electrifying new startups, with an idea that would potentially touch\nevery household in America. Raising one of the largest financial war chests\never seen (more than $800 million), the company aimed to revolutionize the\n$450 billion retail grocery business with online ordering and same-day doorto-door grocery delivery. Webvan believed this was one of the first “killer\napplications” for the Internet. Customers could just point, click, and order.\nWebvan’s CEO told Forbes magazine that Webvan would “set the rules for\nthe largest consumer sector in the economy.”\nBeyond amassing megabucks, the Webvan entrepreneurs seemed to do\neverything right. Backed by experienced venture-capital investors, the\ncompany raced to build vast automated warehouses and bought fleets of\ndelivery trucks while building an easy-to-use website. Webvan hired a\nseasoned CEO from the consulting industry. What’s more, most initial\ncustomers actually liked the service. But barely 24 months after the initial\npublic offering, Webvan was bankrupt and out of business. What happened?\n...barely 24 months after the initial public offering,\nWebvan was bankrupt.\nThis was not a failure of execution. Webvan did everything its board and\ninvestors asked. In particular, the company fervently followed the traditional\nnew-product introduction model commonly used by most new ventures and\nembraced the mantras of the time: “first mover advantage” and “get big fast.”\nWebvan’s failure to ask “where are the customers?” illuminates how this\ntried-and-true model led one of the best-funded startups of all time down the\npath to disaster.\nThe Traditional New-Product Introduction Model\nIn the 20th century, every company bringing a new product to market used\nsome form of product management model (Figure 1.1). Emerging early in the\ncentury, this product-centric model described a process that evolved in\nmanufacturing industries. The consumer packaged-goods industry adopted it\nin the 1950s, and it spread to the technology business in the last quarter of the\ncentury. There it became an integral part of the startup culture.\nAt first glance, the new-product introduction model outlined in the\ndiagram at right appears to be helpful and benign. It illustrates the process of\ngetting a new product into the hands of waiting customers. A new product\nmoves from development to customer testing (alpha/beta test), and using\nfeedback from this initial testing, the product engineers fix technical errors in\nthe product until the product launch date and first customer ship.\nThe new-product introduction model is a good fit for an existing\ncompany where the customers are known, the product features can be spec’ed\nupfront, the market is well-defined, and the basis of competition is\nunderstood.\nNew Product Introduction Diagram (Figure 1.1)\nAs for startups, a scant few fit these criteria. Few even know who their\ncustomers are. Yet many persist in using the new-product introduction model\nnot only to manage product development but as a roadmap for finding\ncustomers and setting the timing for the startup’s sales, launch and revenue\nplans. Investors use the new-product introduction diagram to set and plan\nfunding. All parties involved in the startup use a roadmap leading toward a\nvery different location, yet they’re surprised to end up lost.\nWhat’s wrong with the old model, and how did it contribute to the\nbillion-dollar Webvan implosion?\nConcept and Seed Stage\nAt the concept and seed stage, founders capture their passion and vision for\nthe company, sometimes on the back of a napkin, and turn them into a set of\nkey ideas, which becomes the outline for the business plan.\nNext, issues surrounding the product are defined. What is the product or\nservice concept? What are the product features and benefits? Can it be built?\nIs further technical research needed? Who will the customers be, and where\nwill they be found? Statistical and market research and a few customer\ninterviews fuel the evaluation and business plan.\nThis step also brings forth a first guess at how the product will\nultimately reach the customer, including discussions of competitive\ndifferences, distribution channels, and costs. An initial positioning chart\nexplains the company and its benefits to venture capitalists or corporate\nhigher-ups. The business plan now gets market-size, competitive and\nfinancial sections, with an appendix containing Excel spreadsheets\nforecasting revenue and expenses. Creative writing, passion and shoe leather\ncombine in the concept and seed phase in hopes of convincing an investor to\nfund the company or the new division.\nOnce a waterfall process starts, the proverbial train\nhas left the station...\nWebvan did all of this extremely well. Founded in December 1996, with\na compelling story and a founder with a track record, Webvan raised $10\nmillion from leading Silicon Valley venture capitalists in 1997. In the next\ntwo years, additional private rounds totaling an unbelievable $393 million\nfollowed before the company’s IPO.\nProduct Development\nIn stage two, product development, everyone stops talking and starts\nworking. The respective departments go to their figurative corners as the\ncompany begins to specialize by function. Marketing refines the size of the\nmarket defined in the business plan and begins to target the first customers.\nIn a well-organized startup (one with a fondness for process), the marketing\nfolk might even run a focus group or two on the market they think they’re in\nand work with Product Management on a market requirements document\n(MRD) for engineering to specify the product’s final features and functions.\nMarketing starts to build a sales demo, writes sales materials (websites,\npresentations, data sheets), and hires a pr agency. In this stage, or by alpha\ntest, the company traditionally hires a VP of Sales.\nMeanwhile, Engineering focuses on specifying and then building the\nproduct. The simple box labeled “Product Development” typically expands\ninto a “waterfall” or “spiral” or incremental process of interlacing steps, all\nfocused on minimizing development risk of a defined feature set (Figure 1.2).\nThis process starts with the founder’s vision, which may be expanded into an\nMRD (and a product requirements document), and expands further into\ndetailed engineering specifications. With those in hand, Engineering begins\nimplementation fueled by cold pizza and long nights and weekends. Once a\nwaterfall process starts, the proverbial train has left the station and the\nproduct is nearly impossible to revise. As a rule, the “train” can run almost\nnonstop for 18 or perhaps 24 months or more, uninterrupted by changes or\nnew ideas no matter how good they might be for the business.\nThe Product Development “Waterfall” Model (Figure 1.2)\nIn Webvan’s case, Engineering moved along two fronts: building the\nautomated warehouses and designing the website. The automated warehouses\nwere a technological marvel, with automated conveyors and carousels\ntransporting food items off the shelves to workers who packed them for\ndelivery. Webvan also designed its own inventory, warehouse, and route\nmanagement systems and software to manage the entire customer order and\ndelivery process. This software communicated with the Webvan website and\nissued order-fulfillment instructions to the distribution center. Once a\ndelivery was scheduled, the system’s custom route-planning feature\ndetermined the most efficient route for delivering the goods to customers’\nhomes.\nAt the same time, planning began for a marketing and promotion\nprogram designed to strengthen the Webvan brand name, get customers to try\nthe service in the first target market, build strong customer loyalty, and\nmaximize repeat usage and purchases. The plan was to build Webvan’s brand\nname (down to stickering every cup holder in San Francisco’s AT&T Park)\nand customer loyalty through public relations programs, advertising\ncampaigns and promotional activities. Spending for all these activities was\npart of the business plan.\nAlpha/Beta Test\nIn stage three, the alpha/beta test, Engineering continues building along the\nclassic waterfall development model, working toward the first customer ship\ndate. And, by beta test time, working with a small group of outside users to\ntest the product and ensure that it works as specified. Marketing develops a\ncomplete marketing communications plan, sets up the corporate website,\nprovides Sales with a full complement of support materials, and starts the\npublic relations bandwagon rolling. The pr agency polishes the positioning\nand starts contacting the long-lead-time press and blogs, while Marketing\nstarts the branding activities.\nSales signs up the first beta customers (who may volunteer to pay for the\nprivilege of testing a new product), begins to build the selected distribution\nchannel, and staffs and scales the sales organization outside headquarters.\nThe sales VP works toward achieving the revenue plan as specified in the\nbusiness plan. Investors and board members start measuring progress by the\nnumber of orders in place by first customer ship. The CEO hits the streets and\nthe phone or the parent-company headquarters, searching for additional\ncapital.\nWebvan began to beta-test its grocery delivery service in May 1999 with\nabout 1,100 customers. At the same time, the marketing buzz started with a\npr blitz with hundreds of articles touting the newest entrant in the online\ngrocery business. Private investors poured hundreds of millions of dollars\ninto the company.\nProduct Launch and First Customer Ship\nWith the product working (sort of), the company goes into “big-bang”\nspending mode. The product and the company are launched. The company\nhas a large press event, and Marketing launches a series of programs to create\nend-user demand. In anticipation of sales, the company hires a national sales\norganization; the sales channel has quotas and sales goals. The board begins\nmeasuring company performance based on sales execution against its\nbusiness plan, albeit one typically written at least a year earlier, when the\ncompany first sought investment.\nBuilding a sales channel and supporting marketing burn a lot of cash.\nAssuming no early liquidity event for the company, more fund-raising is\noften required. The CEO looks at the product-launch activities and the scaleup of the sales and marketing team and goes out yet again, palm up, to the\ninvestor community. (In the dot-com bubble economy, investors used an IPO\nat product launch to take the money and run, before there was a track record\nof success or failure.) This operational model no doubt sounds familiar to\nmany: a product- and process-centric model used by countless startups to take\ntheir first products to market.\nWebvan launched its first regional web store in June 1999 (just a month\nafter starting beta test) and filed for its public offering 60 days later. The\ncompany raised $400 million and had a market capitalization of $8.5 billion\nthe day of its IPO—larger than the market cap of the top three grocery chains\ncombined. The elation was short-lived.\nThe 9 Deadly Sins of the New Product\nIntroduction Model\nFor new products like Webvan, the business plan fails as a roadmap\nbecause both the product and the customer are unknown. For most startups,\nthese nine flawed assumptions are the most toxic of all:\n1. Assuming “I Know What the Customer Wants”\nFirst is the founder’s unwavering belief that he or she understands who the\ncustomers will be, what they need, and how to sell it to them. Any\ndispassionate observer would recognize that on Day One, a startup has no\ncustomers, and unless the founder is a true domain expert, he or she can only\nguess about the customer, problem, and business model. On Day One, a\nstartup is a faith-based initiative built on guesses. Yet the traditional product\nintroduction methodology has founders take these many business model\nguesses as facts and go design a product and start spending money to build it\non a race to “first customer ship”—all before talking to a single customer.\nOn Day One, a startup is a faith-based initiative...\nTo succeed, founders need to turn hypotheses or guesses into facts as\nsoon as possible by getting out of the building, asking customers if the\nhypotheses were correct, and quickly changing those that were wrong.\n2. The “I Know What Features to Build” Flaw\nThe second flawed assumption is implicitly driven by the first. Founders,\npresuming they know their customers, assume they know all the features\ncustomers need. These founders specify, design, and build a fully featured\nproduct using classic product development methods without ever leaving\ntheir building. But wait—isn’t that what startups should do? No—that’s what\ncompanies with existing customers do.\n...it’s unknown whether the features appeal to\ncustomers.\nThe waterfall development process proceeds sequentially and without\ninterruption for as long as a year or two. Progress is measured by each new\nline of code written or new piece of hardware built throughout the process\nuntil the product is released. Yet without direct and continuous customer\ncontact, it’s unknown whether the features appeal to customers. Fixing the\ninevitable product mistakes after building and shipping the entire product is\ncostly and time-consuming, if not deadly. It can render the product obsolete\nby launch. Worse, it often causes huge engineering waste, with hundreds of\nhours of work tossed aside, or tons of code cut and dropped to the floor, when\ncustomers say the new features aren’t ones they care about. Ironically,\nstartups were often crippled by the very methodology they traditionally used\nto build new products.\n3. Focus on Launch Date\nThe traditional product introduction model focuses engineering, sales and\nmarketing on the all-important, immovable launch date. Marketing tries to\npick an “event” (trade show, conference, blog, etc.) where they can “launch”\nthe product. Executives look at that date and the calendar, working backward\nto ignite fireworks on the day the product is launched. Neither management\nnor investors tolerate “wrong turns” that result in delays. In fact, traditional\nengineering schedules have test cycles with the names alpha, beta, and\nrelease but rarely allow time to improve the product. They’re still geared to\nputting out the original product with minimal bugs, though.\nThe product launch and first customer ship dates are merely the dates\nwhen a product development team thinks the product’s first release is\n“finished.” It doesn’t mean the company understands its customers or how to\nmarket or sell to them, yet in almost every startup, ready or not, departmental\nclocks are set irrevocably to “first customer ship.” Even worse, a startup’s\ninvestors are managing their financial expectations by this date as well.\nThe chorus of investor voices says, “Why, of course that’s what you do.\nGetting the product to market is what sales and marketing people do in\nstartups. That’s how a startup makes money.” This is deadly advice. Ignore it.\nFocusing only on launch results in a “fire, ready, aim” strategy that ignores\nthe customer discovery process—a fundamental and generally fatal error.\nObviously, every startup or company wants to get a product to market and\nsell it, but that can’t be done until the company understands who it’s selling\nto and why they’ll buy. The forced march ignores the iterative loop that says,\n“If our assumptions are wrong, maybe we need to try something different.” It\nshuts off the “build, test and learn” flow and assumes that customers will\ncome based merely on good engineering execution.\nTime after time, only after launch does a startup discover that not\nenough customers visit its website, play the game, bring their friends, or\nconvert to orders. Or it discovers that early customers don’t scale into a\nmainstream market, or the product doesn’t solve a high-value problem, or the\ncost of distribution is too high. While those discoveries are bad enough, the\nstartup is now burdened with an expensive, scaled-up sales and marketing\norganization—effective only at burning mountains of cash—that’s now\ntrying to figure out what went wrong and how to fix it.\nAt Webvan, the dot-com mania may have intensified the company’s\ndrive to launch, but its single-minded focus was typical of most startups. At\nfirst customer ship, Webvan had close to 400 employees. It hired more than\n500 more during the next six months. By May 1999, the company had opened\nits first $40 million distribution center, built and scaled for a customer base it\ncould only guess at, and it had committed to 15 other distribution centers of\nthe same size. Why? Because the Webvan business plan said to do so,\nregardless of whether the customers agreed.\n4. Emphasis on Execution Instead of Hypotheses,\nTesting, Learning, and Iteration\nStartup cultures emphasize “get it done, and get it done fast.” So it’s natural\nthat heads of engineering, sales and marketing all believe they are hired for\nwhat they know how to do, not what they can learn. They assume that their\nexperience is relevant to this new venture and that all they need do is put that\nknowledge to work managing the execution that’s worked for them before.\nWhile established companies execute business models where customers,\nproblems, and necessary product features are all knowns, startups need to\noperate in a “search” mode as they test and prove every one of their initial\nhypotheses. They learn from the results of each test, refine the hypothesis and\ntest again, all in search of a repeatable, scalable and profitable business\nmodel.\nRelentless execution without knowing what to\nexecute is a crime.\nIn practice, startups begin with a set of initial hypotheses (guesses), most\nof which will end up being wrong. Therefore, focusing on execution and\ndelivering a product or service based on those initial, untested hypotheses is a\ngoing-out-of-business strategy.\nIn contrast, the traditional product introduction model assumes that\nbuilding a startup is a step-by-step, sequential, execution-oriented process.\nEach step unfolds in a logical progression that can be captured in a PERT\nchart (a project management technique that maps the steps and time required\nfor project completion), with milestones and resources assigned for the\ncompletion of each step. But anyone who has ever taken a new product out to\na set of potential customers knows that a good day in front of customers is\ntwo steps forward and one step back. The ability to learn from these missteps\ndistinguishes a successful startup from those that have vanished.\nLike all startups focused on executing to a sequential product\nintroduction plan, Webvan hired vice presidents of merchandising, marketing\nand product management—all oriented around executing a given sales and\nmarketing strategy instead of listening to customers and discovering customer\nneeds. Sixty days after first customer ship, those three VPs employed more\nthan 50 people.\nThe ability to learn from missteps distinguishes a\nsuccessful startup.\n5. Traditional Business Plans Presume No Trial and\nNo Errors\nThe one great advantage of the traditional product development model: it\nprovides boards and founders an unambiguous path with clearly defined\nmilestones the board presumes will be achieved. Most engineers know what\nalpha test, beta test, and first customer ship mean. If the product fails to\nwork, everyone stops to fix it. In stark contrast, before first customer ship,\nsales and marketing activities are ad hoc and fuzzy, and seldom have\nmeasurable, concrete objectives. They lack any way to stop and fix what’s\nbroken (and don’t even know if it’s broken or how to stop).\nFinancial progress is tracked using metrics like income statement,\nbalance sheet and cash flow even when there’s no revenue to measure. In\nreality, none of these are useful for startups. Board directors have simply\nadopted the traditional metrics used in large companies with existing\ncustomers and known business models. In a startup, these metrics don’t track\nprogress against the startup’s only goal: to find a repeatable and scalable\nbusiness model. Instead, traditional metrics get in the way.\nInstead of asking, “How many days to the beta test?” or, “What’s in our\nsales pipeline?” a startup’s board and management team need to ask specific\nquestions about results of its long list of tests and experiments to validate all\ncomponents of its business model.\nIf a startup’s board of directors isn’t asking these kinds of questions, it’s\nwasting time without adding value. No matter what, directors and founders\nmust stay focused on one financial metric that always matters: cash burn rate\nand number of months’ worth of cash left in the bank.\nIf a startup’s board of directors isn’t asking these\nkinds of questions, it’s wasting time...\nWebvan had no milestones saying, “Stop and evaluate the launch\nresults.” Otherwise, it might have noticed the stark contrast between the\n2,000 daily orders it was getting and the 8,000 in the business-plan forecast.\nBefore any meaningful customer feedback was in hand and only a month\nafter shipping began, Webvan signed a $1 billion deal (yes, $1,000,000,000)\nwith Bechtel to build 26 additional distribution centers over the next three\nyears.\n6. Confusing Traditional Job Titles with What a\nStartup Needs to Accomplish\nMost startups have simply borrowed job titles from established companies.\nBut remember, these are jobs in an organization that’s executing a known\nbusiness model. The title Sales in an existing company reflects a team\nrepeatedly selling a known product to a well-understood group of customers\nwith standard presentations, prices, terms, and conditions. Startups by\ndefinition have few if any of these known elements. In fact, they’re out\nsearching for them!\nBecause target customers, product specs and product presentations may\nchange daily, early-stage startup executives need dramatically different skills\nfrom executives who are working in an established company selling\nestablished products or line extensions. The demands of customer discovery\nrequire people who are comfortable with change, chaos, and learning from\nfailure and are at ease working in risky, unstable situations without a\nroadmap. In short, startups should welcome the rare breed generally known\nas entrepreneurs. They’re open to learning and discovery—highly curious,\ninquisitive, and creative. They must be eager to search for a repeatable and\nscalable business model. Agile enough to deal with daily change and\noperating “without a map.” Readily able to wear multiple hats, often on the\nsame day, and comfortable celebrating failure when it leads to learning and\niteration.\nWebvan’s CEO and VPs all came from large-company backgrounds and\nexperience. They were surprised and uncomfortable with the chaos of a\nstartup and tried to solve the problem by scaling the company rapidly.\n...measuring progress against a product launch or\nrevenue plan is simply false progress.\n7. Sales and Marketing Execute to a Plan\nHiring VPs and execs with the right titles but the wrong skills leads to further\nstartup trouble as high-powered sales and marketing people arrive on the\npayroll to execute the “plan.” Here’s how it typically unfolds:\nFollowing the business plan and the traditional product introduction\nmodel, the board and founders agree to a launch date, a burn rate, a revenue\nplan and a set of milestones. The sales VP begins to hire the core sales team,\ndesign sales pitches, and make appointments and attempts to acquire early\n“lighthouse” customers (prominent customers who will attract others). At the\nsame time, the sales team uses revenue goals specified in the business plan to\ntrack its progress in understanding customers. Meanwhile, the marketing VP\nis busy designing websites, logos, presentations, data sheets and collateral,\nand hiring pr agencies to create buzz. These tactics become marketing\nobjectives, even though they’re merely tactics. Marketing discovers whether\nits positioning, messaging, pricing and demand-creation activities will work\nonly after first customer ship.\nExecutives and board members accustomed to measurable signs of\nprogress against “the plan” will focus on these execution activities because\nthis is what they know how to do (and what they believe they were hired to\ndo). Of course, in established companies with known customers and markets,\nthis focus makes sense. And even in some startups in “existing markets,”\nwhere customers and markets are known, it might work. But in a majority of\nstartups, measuring progress against a product launch or revenue plan is\nsimply false progress, since it transpires in a vacuum absent real customer\nfeedback, instead of searching for an understanding of customers and their\nproblems and replacing assumptions with facts.\nWebvan set off on this kind of plan-driven “marketing death march.” In\nits first six months, it acquired an impressive 47,000 new customers, but 71\npercent of its 2,000 daily orders were repeat orders, which meant Webvan\nneeded to quickly secure many more new customers and reduce its high\ncustomer attrition rate. Making matters worse, Webvan had scaled its\nspending based on unverified and, it turned out, highly optimistic marketing\nguesses.\n8. Presumption of Success Leads to Premature\nScaling\nThe business plan, its revenue forecast, and the product introduction model\nassume that every step a startup takes proceeds flawlessly and smoothly to\nthe next. The model leaves little room for error, learning, iteration or\ncustomer feedback. Nothing says, “Stop or slow down hiring until you\nunderstand customers,” or, “pause to process customer feedback.” Even the\nmost experienced executives are pressured to hire and staff per the plan\nregardless of progress. This leads to the next startup disaster: premature\nscaling.\nIn large companies, the mistakes just have\nadditional zeros in them.\nHiring and spending should accelerate only after sales and marketing\nhave become predictable, repeatable, scalable processes—not when the plan\nsays they’re scheduled to begin (or when the “lighthouse” account is signed\nor a few sales are made).\nIn large companies, the mistakes just have additional zeros in them.\nMicrosoft and Google, powerhouses though may they be, launch product\nafter product—Google’s Orkut and Wave, Deskbar, Dodgeball, Talk and\nFinance; Microsoft’s “Kin,” Vista, Zune, “Bob,” WebTV, MSNTV,\nPocketPC—on rigid schedules driven by “the model” and the presumption of\nsuccess. Shortly thereafter, a lack of customer response delivers a fast, quiet\nfuneral for product and management alike.\nAt Webvan, premature scaling permeated a company culture dominated\nby the prevailing venture-capital mantra of the time, “get big fast.” It spent\n$18 million to develop proprietary software and $40 million to set up its first\nautomated warehouse before it had shipped a single item. Premature scaling\nhad dire consequences, assuring that the Webvan case will be taught in\nbusiness schools for decades to come. As customer demand failed to live up\nto Webvan’s business plan, the company slowly realized it had overbuilt and\noverdesigned. While Webvan had executed to its plan, it had also failed to\npay attention to its customers.\n...no business plan survives first contact with\ncustomers.\n9. Management by Crisis Leads to a Death Spiral\nAt Webvan, the consequences of all the mistakes began to show by the time\nof first customer ship. The story usually unfolds like this:\nSales starts to miss its numbers and the board becomes concerned. The\nsales VP arrives at a board meeting, still optimistic, and provides a set of\nreasonable explanations. The board raises a collective eyebrow. The VP\nreturns to the field to exhort the troops to work harder. Sales asks\nEngineering to build custom versions of the product for special customers,\nsince this is the only way that the increasingly desperate sales force can close\nthe sale. Board meetings become increasingly tense. Shortly thereafter, the\nsales VP is probably terminated as part of the “solution.”\nA new sales VP hired and quickly concludes that the company just\ndidn’t understand its customers or how to sell them. She decides that the\ncompany’s positioning and marketing strategy were incorrect and that the\nproduct was missing critical features. Since the new sales VP was hired to\n“fix” sales, the marketing department must now respond to a sales manager\nwho believes that whatever was created earlier in the company was wrong.\n(After all, it got the old VP fired, right?) A new sales plan buys the new sales\nVP a few months’ honeymoon.\nSometimes all it takes is one or two iterations to find the right sales\nroadmap and positioning to attract exuberant customers. In tougher times,\nwhen dollars are tighter, the next round of funding may never come.\nBut the problem at Webvan was not an incorrect sales strategy or\npositioning statement. The problem is that no business plan survives first\ncontact with customers. The assumptions in the Webvan business plan were\nsimply a series of untested hypotheses. When real results came in, they\nlearned that the guesses in their revenue plan were wrong. Focusing on\nexecuting their business plans, Webvan iterated their strategy and their search\nfor a business model by firing executives.\nFailure is an integral part of the search for a\nbusiness model.\nWebvan went public in 1999, and its sea of red ink was reported\nquarterly for all to see. Rather than acknowledge its unrealistic plan and scale\nback or retrench, the company kept spending against its flailing strategy,\naccumulating a $612 million deficit in the process. Seven months after its\nIPO, Webvan filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\nThe ironic Webvan postscript: two other companies on two continents\nsaw the same opportunity at the same time but developed their businesses by\nfollowing Customer Development precepts even though they hadn’t been\npublished at the time. Peapod and Tesco are both successful, growing, and\nprofitable today. They started smaller, without carving hypothetical\nassumptions and plans in stone, and learned what customers wanted as they\ndeveloped business and financial models that worked. Tesco, a UK company\nthat used retail stores as its launch pad and “warehouse,” today delivers more\nthan 85,000 orders a week and earns more than $559 million in sales. Peapod,\nan American company, has delivered more than 10 million grocery orders to\nmore than 330,000 customers. Explicitly or implicitly, both understood the\ntest-and-iterate process of Customer Development.\nCHAPTER 2\nThe Path to the Epiphany: The Customer\nDevelopment Model\nHow narrow the gate and constricted the road that leads to life. And\nthose who find it are few.\n—Matthew 7:14\nWHEN WILL HARVEY APPROACHED STEVE BLANK with a new business idea\nin June 2004, Steve uncharacteristically almost took out his checkbook before\nhearing Will’s pitch. Steve had invested in Will’s previous company,\nThere.com, and sat on its board. Before that, Will had been Steve’s\nengineering VP at Rocket Science, a video-game company with Steve as\nfounding CEO. Rocket Science is infamous for appearing on the cover of\nWired magazine while blowing through $35 million in venture capital in less\nthan three years, leaving a crater so deep it has its own iridium layer.\nSitting in Steve’s living room, Will explained his vision for IMVU, a\n“virtual world” company with 3D avatar-based instant messaging and social\nnetworking. Will had a world-class reputation. He developed Music\nConstruction Set, a worldwide best-selling video game, at the age of 15. He\nearned his bachelor’s, master’s and Ph.D. in computer science at Stanford\nwhile running a video-game company that developed hits like Zany Golf,\nImmortal, and Marble Madness.\nWill’s co-founder, Eric Ries, had started an online recruiting company\nwhile earning his computer science degree at Yale. Eric had joined Will’s last\nstartup as a senior software engineer. That company built a “virtual world” on\nthe web using a multiyear waterfall development model. After three years,\nthe product was ready to launch with a big-bang product introduction guided\nby a hired big gun, a CEO with large company experience. Only then did\nthey discover that customers didn’t want or care about most of the features\nthey had so painstakingly built.\nSteve told the IMVU founders that in exchange for his check to help\nfund their seed round, they were required to audit his Customer Development\nclass at U.C. Berkeley’s Haas Business School. As the semester unfolded,\nWill and Eric realized that the Customer Development principles they were\nlearning would save them from repeating the same errors they made in their\nprevious startup. Thus IMVU’s co-founders became the first Customer\nDevelopment pioneers.\n...in exchange for his check to help fund IMVU’s\nseed round, they were required to audit Steve’s\nCustomer Development class.\nSteve sat on IMVU’s board and watched, coached and cheered as Will\nand Eric paired the Customer Development process with agile software\ndevelopment. They built a process that used customer feedback and testing to\nhelp them determine the minimum product features customers most valued.\nBased on its initial set of hypotheses about its customer, IMVU set out to\ncreate a 3D chat add-on where users could create customizable avatars and\ntalk to all their friends on the leading instant messenger of the day, America\nOnline. After a year, IMVU could see that all its customer hypotheses were\nwrong. While customers liked the 3D avatars, they wanted to create their own\nseparate buddy lists instead of using the one they already had on AOL.\nIMVU learned that customers didn’t want to talk to their existing friends but\nwanted to meet new people and make new friends. Quarter after quarter, this\nkind of customer feedback created a “two steps forward, one step back”\nlearning process that supplied the Customer Development principles they\nlearned in class.\nMost startups lack a structured process for testing\ntheir business model hypotheses.\nIMVU tested, pivoted and tested again until it had the product right.\nInstead of creating a crisis, this learning process was an integral part of the\ncompany. IMVU had integrated Customer Development and agile\nengineering and had become the first Lean Startup.\nThe result was a profitable, growing company. Why was IMVU on the\nroad to success while scores of other virtual world and avatar companies have\nlong since folded? What was it about Customer Development that gave Will\nand Eric a clearer roadmap at IMVU than they had at their previous\ncompany?\nAn Introduction to Customer Development\nOne of the things startups have lacked is a definition of who they were. For\nyears we’ve treated startups like they are just smaller versions of a large\ncompany.\nHowever, we now know that a startup is a temporary organization\ndesigned to search for a repeatable and scalable business model. Within this\ndefinition, a startup can be a new venture or it can be a new division or\nbusiness unit in an existing company.\nIf your business model is unknown – that is, just a set of untested\nhypotheses — you are a startup searching for a repeatable business model.\nOnce your business model (market, customers, features, channels, pricing,\nGet/Keep/Grow strategy, etc.) is known, you will be executing it. Search\nversus execution is what differentiates a new venture from an existing\nbusiness unit.\nStrategy\nThe term business model first appeared ~50 years ago, but the concept\ndidn’t catch on until the 1990’s. It became common vernacular to discuss\nbusiness models, but without a standard framework and vernacular, confusion\nreigned. In 2010 when Alexander Osterwalder published his book Business\nModel Generation he provided a visual ontology and a clear vernacular that\nwas sorely needed, and it became clear that this was the tool to organize\nstartup hypotheses.\nThe primary objective of a startup is to validate its business model\nhypotheses (and iterate and pivot until it does). Then it moves into execution\nmode. It’s at this point the business needs an operating plan, financial\nforecasts and other well-understood management tools.\nProcess\nYet as powerful as the Business Model Canvas (a template with the nine\nblocks of a business model) is, at the end of the day it was a tool for\nbrainstorming hypotheses without a formal way of testing them.\nThe processes used to organize and implement the search for the\nbusiness model are Customer Development and Agile Development. A search\nfor a business model can be in any new business – in a brand new startup new\nor in a new division of an existing company.\nThe Customer Development model depicted in Figure 2.1 breaks out all\nthe customer-related activities of an early-stage company into four easy-tounderstand steps. The first two steps of the process outline the “search” for\nthe business model. Steps three and four “execute” the business model that’s\nbeen developed, tested, and proven in steps one and two. The steps:\nCustomer discovery first captures the founders’ vision and turns it into a\nseries of business model hypotheses. Then it develops a plan to test\ncustomer reactions to those hypotheses and turn them into facts\nCustomer validation tests whether the resulting business model is\nrepeatable and scalable. If not, you return to customer discovery\nCustomer creation is the start of execution. It builds end-user demand\nand drives it into the sales channel to scale the business\nCompany-building transitions the organization from a startup to a\ncompany focused on executing a validated model\nIn search, you want a process designed to be dynamic, so you work with a\nrough business model description knowing it will change. The model changes\nbecause startups use customer development to run experiments to test the\nhypotheses that make up the model. And most of the time these experiments\nfail. Search embraces failure as a natural part of the startup process. Unlike\nexisting companies that fire executives when they fail to match a plan, we\nkeep the founders and change the model.\nThe specific processes associated with the two search steps are described in\nthe following pages.\nOnce a company has found a business model (it knows its market,\ncustomers, product/service, channel, pricing, etc.), the organization moves\nfrom search to execution.\nThe product execution process – managing the life cycle of existing\nproducts and the launch of follow-on products – is the job of the product\nmanagement and engineering organizations. It results in a linear process\nwhere you make a plan and refine it into detail. The more granularity you add\nto a plan, the better people can execute it: a Business Requirement document\n(BRD) leads to a Market Requirements Document (MRD) and then gets\nhanded off to engineering as a Functional Specifications Document (FSD)\nimplemented via Agile or Waterfall development.\nOrganization\nSearching for a business model requires a different organization than\nthe one used to execute a plan. Searching requires the company to be\norganized around a customer development team led by the founders. In\ncontrast, execution (which follows search) requires the company to be\norganized by function (product management, sales, marketing, business\ndevelopment, etc.).\nCompanies in execution suffer from a “fear of failure culture“ (quite\nunderstandable since they were hired to execute a known job spec.) Startups\nwith Customer Development Teams have a “learning and discovery” culture\nfor search. The fear of making a move before the last detail is nailed down is\none of the biggest problems existing companies have when they need to learn\nhow to search.\nThe idea of not having a functional organization until the organization\nhas found a proven business model is one of the hardest things for new\nstartups to grasp. There are no sales, marketing or business development\ndepartments when you are searching for a business model. If you’ve\norganized your startup with those departments, you are not really doing\ncustomer development. (It’s like trying to implement a startup using\nWaterfall engineering.)\nCustomer Development Process (Figure 2.1)\n“The Search for a Business Model:” Steps, Iteration\nand Pivots\nIn the Customer Development model, each step is represented as a circular\ntrack with recursive arrows in order to highlight that each step is iterative. It’s\na polite way of saying, “Startups are unpredictable. We will have failures and\nwe will screw it up several times before we get it right.”\nIn contrast, a traditional product introduction plan makes no provision\nfor moving backward. To do so would be considered a failure. No wonder\nmost startup founders are embarrassed when they’re out in the field learning,\nfailing, and learning some more. The diagram their boards of directors have\nbeaten into them says, “Move from left to right and you’re a success. Go\nright to left and you’ll get fired.” This is why startup sales and marketing\nefforts tend to move forward even when it’s patently obvious that they\nhaven’t nailed the market. Experience with scores of startups shows that only\nin business-school case studies does progress addressing customers’ key\nneeds happen in a smooth, linear fashion.\nMeanwhile, the Customer Development model embraces the way\nstartups actually work, with moving backward playing a natural and valuable\nrole in learning and discovery. Startups will cycle through each step of the\nCustomer Development process until they achieve “escape velocity”—\nenough measurable progress in finding the business model as defined by\nboard and team—to propel forward to the next step.\n...what could customers tell us except that we were\nright?\nEric Ries recalls his pre-IMVU days at There.com: “The company sort\nof wanted customer feedback but not really. From our perspective, what\ncould customers tell us except that we were right? The marketing team held\nfocus groups, but looking back, they were orchestrated to get the answers we\nwanted to hear.” The Customer Development model assumes it will take\nseveral iterations of each of the four steps to get it right. The philosophy of\n“It’s not only OK to screw it up—plan to learn from it” is the core of the\nprocess.\nNote that each of the four steps has a stop sign at its exit. That’s simply\na reminder to think through whether enough has been learned to charge ahead\nto the next step. It’s a place to stop and summarize all the learning and, of\ncourse, to candidly assess whether the company has reached “escape\nvelocity.”\nLet’s take a closer look at each of the four steps of the Customer\nDevelopment model.\nStep 1: Customer Discovery\nCustomer discovery translates a founder’s vision for the company into\nhypotheses about each component of the business model and creates a set of\nexperiments to test each hypothesis. To do this, founders leave guesswork\nbehind and get out of the building to test customer reaction to each\nhypothesis, gain insights from their feedback, and adjust the business model.\nOf all the lessons of Customer Development, the importance of getting out of\nthe building and into conversations with your customers is the most critical.\nOnly by moving away from the comforts of your conference room to truly\nengage with and listen to your customers can you learn in depth about their\nproblems, product features they believe will solve those problems, and the\nprocess in their company for recommending, approving and purchasing\nproducts. You’ll need these details to build a successful product, articulate\nyour product’s unique differences and propose a compelling reason why your\ncustomers should buy it.\nCustomer discovery is not about collecting feature lists from prospective\ncustomers or running lots of focus groups. In a startup, the founders define\nthe product vision and then use customer discovery to find customers and a\nmarket for that vision. (Read that last sentence again. The initial product\nspecification comes from the founders’ vision, not the sum of a set of focus\ngroups.)\nIn a startup, the founders define the product vision\nand then use customer discovery to find customers\nand a market for that vision.\nCustomer discovery includes two outside-the-building phases. The first\ntests customer perception of the problem and the customer’s need to solve it.\nIs it important enough that the right product will drive significant numbers of\ncustomers to buy or engage with the product? The second phase shows\ncustomers the product for the first time, assuring that the product (usually a\nminimum viable product at this point) elegantly solves the problem or fills\nthe need well enough to persuade lots of customers to buy. When customers\nenthusiastically confirm the importance of both the problem and the solution,\ncustomer discovery is complete.\nPivots may happen in the customer discovery phase. Failure will\nhappen. It is a normal part of the startup process. Misunderstanding or just\ngetting wrong key assumptions about your business model happen often: who\nyour customers are, what problems they needed to solve, what features would\nsolve them, how much customers would pay to solve them, etc. Pivots are a\nresponse to these mistakes. A pivot is a major change to one of the nine\nbusiness model hypotheses based on learning from customer feedback. Pivots\nhappen often in the Customer Development process. A pivot is not a failure.\nIn fact, embracing the fact that startups regularly fail and pivot along the way\nis perhaps one of the greatest insights in this book.\nFor web/mobile apps, or products, customer discovery begins when\nthe first “low-fidelity” version of the website or app is up and running. The\nwebsite is used to test the business model hypotheses against customers or\nusers. When the product is bits, a rough minimum viable product can often be\nassembled in days if not hours, and entrepreneurs can start the search for\ncustomers almost at once, refining their product and customer-acquisition\nstrategies on the fly. This approach served many recent startup stars quite\nwell, including Facebook and Groupon, which began the quest for customers\nwith rough-hewn products almost the day they opened their doors.\nA pivot is not a failure.\nAnother key element of customer discovery is that the founder is free to\nignore all of it. At times (particularly in a new market) a founder’s vision of\nwhat can be is clearer than the vision of potential customers. But this corner\ncase requires the founder to be able to articulate the “why,” not just ignore it.\nThe IMVU team shipped a buggy minimalist product quickly and\ndeployed a whopping marketing budget of $5 a day, using Google AdWords\nto attract roughly 100 new daily users to the site. They vigilantly observed,\nmonitored and assessed every user’s on-site behavior. Heavy (paying) users\nwere then assaulted with questions in online chats, surveys, phone calls from\nfounders and more. Perhaps the ugliest (or most flattering) comment: “It\nseems to crash my computer every time I use it,” said one user who kept\ncoming back for more! But four months after funding, a (clearly minimal)\nnew product was born, using feedback reflecting the power of customer\ndiscovery.\nStep 2: Customer Validation\nCustomer validation proves that the business tested and iterated in customer\ndiscovery has a repeatable, scalable business model that can deliver the\nvolume of customers required to build a profitable company. During\nvalidation, the company tests its ability to scale (i.e., product, customer\nacquisition, pricing and channel activities) against a larger number of\ncustomers with another round of tests, that are larger in scale and more\nrigorous and quantitative. During this step, a startup also develops a sales\nroadmap for the sales and marketing teams (to be hired later) or validates the\nonline demand creation plan. Simply put, does adding $1 in sales and\nmarketing resources generate $2+ of revenue (or users, views, clicks, or\nwhatever the metric may be)? The resulting roadmap will be field-tested here\nby selling the product to early customers.\nIn web/mobile apps, customer validation calls for the deployment of\na “hi-fidelity” version of the MVP to test key features in front of customers.\nCustomer validation proves the existence of a set of customers, confirms that\ncustomers will accept the MVP, and validates serious, measurable purchase\nintent among customers.\nHow? Depending on the business model, validation is measured by “test\nsales” that get customers to hand over their money (or become actively\nengaged with the product). In a single-sided market (one where the user is the\npayer), a steady stream of customer purchases validates the concept far more\nsolidly than lots of polite words. There’s no surrogate for people paying for a\nproduct. In a “two-sided” or ad-supported business model, a customer base of\nhundreds of thousands that’s growing exponentially usually implies that the\ncompany can find a set of advertisers willing to pay to reach those users.\nIn essence, the first two steps in the Customer Development model—\ncustomer discovery and customer validation—refine, corroborate, and test a\nstartup’s business model. Completing these first two steps verifies the\nproduct’s core features, the market’s existence, locates customers, tests the\nproduct’s perceived value and demand, identifies the economic buyer (the\nperson who writes the check to buy the product), establishes pricing and\nchannel strategies, and checks out the proposed sales cycle and process. Only\nwhen an adequately sized group of customers and a repeatable sales process\nthat yields a profitable business model are clearly identified and validated is\n“escape velocity” achieved. At that point, it’s time to move on to the next\nstep: scaling up, also known as customer creation.\nLearning that a hypothesis is wrong is not a crisis.\nIn Will’s and Eric’s pre-IMVU startup, their CEO and board forced\nthem to wait three years and spend $30 million to perfect the product with\nminimal customer feedback. By contrast, IMVU launched a buggy early\nproduct roughly 120 days after it was founded. Amazingly, some customers\nloved the buggy product enough not only to pay for it, but also to give the\nfounders what they wanted: feedback (and money).\nThe IMVU team used customer feedback relentlessly to drive the\nenhancement, addition and deletion of features that “heavy users” liked or\ndidn’t. One critical pricing discovery led to a 30 percent increase in revenue.\nWhen teenagers bemoaned their lack of access to credit cards, IMVU reacted\nquickly by allowing users to pay IMVU via gift cards distributed through 7-\nEleven and Walmart, online, and via other major retail channels.\nA Customer Development Bonus: Minimum Waste of Cash and Time\nThe first two Customer Development steps limit the amount of money a\nstartup spends until it has tested and validated a business model and is ready\nto scale. Instead of hiring sales and marketing staff, leasing new buildings or\nbuying ads, startup founders get out of the building to test the business model\nhypotheses, and that costs very little in cash.\nWhen paired with agile engineering, Customer Development reduces the\namount of wasted code, features or hardware. Agile development builds the\nproduct in small increments, allowing the company to test and measure\ncustomer reactions to each new iteration of the product. It won’t take three\nyears to find out that customers don’t want or need or can’t use the features\nthe team labored lovingly over.\nSince the Customer Development model assumes that most startups\ncycle through discovery and validation multiple times, it allows a wellmanaged company to carefully estimate and frugally husband its cash. It also\nhelps “husband” founders’ equity, since the closer a company is to a\npredictable, scalable business model, the higher its likely valuation—\npreserving more stock for the founders at fundraising time. The IMVU\nfounders, for example, only hired product development teams (not sales,\nmarketing, or business development) until they had proof in hand of a\nbusiness worth building. With that proof, the company can move through the\nthird and fourth steps, customer creation and company-building, to capitalize\non the opportunity.\nStep 3: Customer Creation\nCustomer creation builds on the company’s initial sales success. It’s where\nthe company steps on the gas, spending large sums to scale by creating enduser demand and driving it into the sales channel. This step follows customer\nvalidation, moving heavy marketing spending after a startup has learned how\nto acquire customers, thus controlling the cash burn rate to protect a most\nprecious “green” asset, cash.\nCustomer creation varies by startup type. Some startups enter existing\nmarkets well-defined by their competitors, others create new markets where\nno product or company exists, and still others attempt a hybrid by resegmenting an existing market as a low-cost entrant or by creating a niche.\nEach market-type strategy demands different customer creation activities and\ncosts. (Market type is addressed in depth later.)\nInitially, IMVU ran a wide range of low-cost customer segmentation\nexperiments. Soon they identified two distinct customer segments—teens and\nmoms—and spending ramped up to underwrite two entirely different\ncustomer creation efforts.\nStep 4: Company-Building\n“Graduation day” arrives when the startup finds a scalable, repeatable\nbusiness model. At this point it’s fundamentally no longer the temporary\nsearch-oriented organization known as a startup—it’s a company! In a\nsometimes-bittersweet transition out of startup mode, company-building\nrefocuses the team’s energy away from “search” mode and to a focus on\nexecution, swapping its informal learning- and discovery-oriented Customer\nDevelopment team for formal, structured departments such as Sales,\nMarketing and Business Development, among others, complete with VPs.\nThese executives now focus on building their departments to scale the\ncompany.\nThis is where the entrepreneurs’ version of a Shakespearean tragedy\noften takes center stage, as VCs realize they have a “hit” with potential for a\nlarge return on their investment. All of a sudden, the passionate visionary\nentrepreneur is no longer deemed the right person to lead the now-successful\ncompany he or she has nurtured from cocktail napkin to high-trajectory. The\nboard—graciously or not—ousts the founder and all his or her innate\ncustomer understanding, trading him or her in for a “suit,” an experienced\noperating executive. There goes the neighborhood, as the company declares\nsuccess, the entrepreneurial spark often sputters, and process often drowns\nenergy.\nAt IMVU, the founders saw the company rapidly scaling beyond their\nskill set. But instead of being fired, they recognized the need for a seasoned\noperating executive, recruited a skilled CEO, and named themselves\nchairmen of the board and active board members. Their new CEO was skilled\nat managing the transition from searching for a business to execution and\ngrew the company steadily.\nCHAPTER 3\nThe Customer Development Manifesto\nBEFORE DIVING HEADFIRST INTO THE DETAILS of the Customer Development\nprocess, it’s crucial to review the 14 rules that make up The Customer\nDevelopment Manifesto. Embrace them. Review them regularly with the team\nand (maybe after the IPO) consider perhaps even etching them in marble at\nworld headquarters.\nRule No. 1:\nThere Are No Facts Inside Your Building, So Get\nOutside.\nOn Day One, the startup is a faith-based enterprise built on its founders’\nvision and a notable absence of facts. The founders’ job is to translate this\nvision and these hypotheses into facts. Facts live outside the building, where\nfuture customers (prospects, really) live and work, so that’s where you need\nto go. Nothing is more fundamental to Customer Development, and nothing\nis harder to do. It’s much easier to write code, build hardware, have meetings\nand write reports than it is to find and listen to potential customers. But that’s\nwhat separates the winners from the losers.\nFacts live outside the building, where future\ncustomers live and work...\nIn Customer Development, the founders gather firsthand experience\nabout every component of the business model. The team can support the\nfounders, but firsthand experience by definition cannot be delegated. This\ncustomer research must be done by founders because:\nKey customer feedback points are random, unpredictable, and often\npainful to hear. Employees hate to deliver bad news to higher-ups\nEmployees have far less at stake and seldom listen as acutely, and they\ndon’t get heard adequately when they report back. It’s too easy to\ndismiss their findings as “hearsay” or to ignore critical points of\nfeedback\nConsultants have even less at stake than employees and often color their\ncommentary to either tell the client what he wants to hear or deliver\nmessages that can lead to extended consulting relationships. This is also\nsecond- or third-hand feedback and too diluted or diffused to provide\nvalue\nOnly a founder can embrace the feedback, react to it, and adeptly make\nthe decisions necessary to change or pivot key business model components.\nRule No. 2:\nPair Customer Development with Agile\nDevelopment\nCustomer Development is useless unless the product\ndevelopment organization can iterate the product\nwith speed and agility.\nCustomer Development is useless unless the product development\norganization can iterate the product with speed and agility. If Engineering\nbuilds the product using waterfall development, it will be deaf, dumb and\nblind to customer input except during a short period when it’s specifying the\nproduct. The rest of the time, engineers are locked into an implementation\ncycle, unable to change the product features without intolerable delay. By\ncontrast, a startup engineering organization using an agile methodology is\ndesigned to continually take customer input and deliver a product that iterates\nreadily around an MVP or its minimum feature set.\nIn this book, agile engineering/development refers to the rapid\ndeployment, iterative development and continuous discovery processes that\nhardware or software companies can use. We don’t advocate any particular\nflavor, just its necessity. The Customer Development process provides the\ncontinuous customer input to make agile work.\nBefore the company even starts, the founders need to reach a deep and\ninexorable commitment to the customer/agile development partnership.\nRule No. 3:\nFailure is an Integral Part of the Search\nOne of the key differences between a startup and an existing company is the\none that’s never explicitly stated: “startups go from failure to failure.”\nIn contrast, existing companies have learned what works and doesn’t.\nFailures in an existing company are an exception. They happen when\nsomeone screws up. In a startup, you’re searching, not executing, and the\nonly way to find the right path is to try lots of experiments and take a lot of\nwrong turns. Failure is part of the process.\nIf you’re afraid to fail in a startup, you’re destined\nto do so.\nFailures are not truly failures, per se but an integral part of the startup\nlearning process. You’ll be running dozens if not hundreds of pass/fail tests\n—on your pitch, your features, your pricing, and on and on—so get ready to\naccept failure and move on. When something isn’t working, successful\nfounders orient themselves to the new facts, decide what needs fixing, and act\ndecisively.\nThe Customer Development process demands frequent, agile iteration,\nfollowed, of course, by testing of the iteration that often leads to another\niteration or pivot, which leads to more testing and...\nIf you’re afraid to fail in a startup, you’re destined to do so.\nRule No. 4:\nMake Continuous Iterations and Pivots\nThe strategy of embracing failure in Customer Development demands\nfrequent, agile iteration and pivots. A pivot is a substantive change in one or\nmore of the nine boxes of the business model canvas. (For example, a pricing\nchange from freemium to subscription model or a customer segment shift\nfrom boys 12-15 years old to women 45-60.) Or it can be more complex,\nsuch as a change of target customer or user. Iterations, meanwhile, are minor\nchanges to business model components (e.g., changing pricing from $99 to\n$79).\nGroupon’s legendary $12 billion pivot is a perfect\nexample.\nWhen a company is limping along, only a dramatic change to one or\nmore business model components can get it back on the road to success.\nGroupon’s legendary $12 billion pivot (their IPO valuation) is a perfect\nexample. Groupon was started from a company called the Point. It was\nstruggling, at best, as a social media platform working to get people together\nto solve problems, but was about to run out of money.\nThe most effective campaigns on The Point were those that saved people\nmoney by grouping or bundling their purchases. The founders started\nblogging various deals from different businesses each day. They called this,\n“Get Your Groupon.com.” Groupon’s first offer hit in October of 2008: buy\ntwo pizzas for the price of one in the shop on the first floor of its Chicago\nheadquarters. Twenty people bought the deal and the company was well on\nits way to its $12-billion pivot.\nPivots are driven by the learnings and insight from a continuous stream\nof “pass/fail” tests you run throughout discovery and validation.\nThe best startup founders don’t hesitate to make the change. They admit\nwhen hypotheses are wrong and adapt.\nRule No. 5:\nNo Business Plan Survives First Contact with\nCustomers So Use a Business Model Canvas\nThere’s only one reason for a business plan: some investor who went to\nbusiness school doesn’t know any better and wants to see one. But once it has\ndelivered financing, the business plan is fundamentally useless.\nEntrepreneurs often mistake their business plan as a cookbook for execution,\nfailing to recognize that it is only a collection of unproven assumptions. At its\nback, a revenue plan blessed by an investor, and composed overwhelmingly\nof guesses, suddenly becomes an operating plan driving hiring, firing, and\nspending. Insanity.\nThe difference between a static business plan and a\ndynamic model could well be the difference between\nflameout and success.\nThe difference between a static business plan and a dynamic business\nmodel could well be the difference between a flameout and success. Startups\nshould dump the business plan and adopt the flexible business model.\nA business model describes the flow between key components of the\ncompany:\nvalue proposition, which the company offers (product/service, benefits)\ncustomer segments, such as users, and payers, or moms or teens\ndistribution channels to reach customers and offer them the value\nproposition\ncustomer relationships to create demand\nrevenue streams generated by the value proposition(s)\nresources needed to make the business model possible\nactivities necessary to implement the business model\npartners who participate in the business and their motivations for doing\nso\ncost structure resulting from the business model\nThe business model canvas (see Figure 3.1) presents a visual overview\nof the nine components of a business on one page. In this book, Alexander\nOsterwalder’s business model canvas serves as the scorecard for the customer\ndiscovery process described in Step One. Osterwalder’s book Business Model\nGeneration (Wiley, 2010) provides the structure for the canvas.\nBusiness Model Canvas (Figure 3.1)\nAs a startup moves through the Customer Development process, it will\nuse the business model canvas as a scorecard, by posting the hypotheses\nabout each component of the model and then revising the hypotheses as the\nfounders gather facts. Think of your first version of the business model\ncanvas as the starting point showing the hypotheses that must be confirmed in\nface-to-face or online interaction with customers. More often than not, the\ncustomers will reject components of the business model, saying, “I’d rather\nbuy that from a retailer,” or, “The product needs to have these features to be\nimportant to me.” As customers approve or dispute the business model\nhypotheses, the company either accepts the customers’ approval or pivots to\nchange its business model to better target the opportunity.\nUsing the business model canvas as a guide makes it easier to figure out\nwhere and how to pivot, since the team can visually diagram its alternatives\nand see what it needs to change. Each time the founders iterate or pivot (see\nRule No. 4) in response to customer feedback, they draw a new canvas\nshowing the changes. Over time, these multiple canvases form a “flip book”\nthat shows the evolution of the business model. Agile startups can end up\nwith a six-inch-thick stack of business model diagrams they can burn at the\nIPO-celebration bonfire.\nMuch more about how to use business model diagrams to “keep score”\nthroughout the customer discovery process can be found in Chapter 4.\n...hypothesis is just a fancy word for “guess.”\nRule No. 6:\nDesign Experiments and Test to Validate Your\nHypotheses\nInitially, hypothesis is just a fancy word for “guess.” To turn hypotheses into\nfacts, founders need to get out of the building and test them in front of\ncustomers. But how do you test? And what do you want to learn from the\ntests? Testing and learning require you to be thoughtful on constructing and\ndesigning your tests. We call this “designing the experiments.”\nCustomer Development experiments are short, simple, objective\npass/fail tests. You’re looking for a strong signal in the signal/noise noise\nratio, something like five of the first 12 customers you call on saying “I need\nthis right now, even if it’s still buggy.” Early tests aren’t necessarily precise,\nbut should give you a “good enough” signal to proceed.\nThe Customer Development Insight Cycle (Figure 3.2)\nStart by asking yourself, “What insight do I need to move forward?”\nThen ask, “What’s the simplest test I can run to get it?” Finally, think about,\n“How do I design an experiment to run this simple test?”\nOne of the things that trips up engineering founders is thinking that\nthese tests have to be actual code, hardware or the real product. Most of the\ntime you can mock-up the web page or create a demo or physical prototype to\nelicit valuable learning.\nRule No. 7:\nAgree on Market Type. It Changes Everything\nOne of the radical insights guiding this book is that not all startups are alike.\nOne of the key ways in which they are different is in the relationship between\na startup’s new product and its market. These product/market relationships\ngenerally fit one of these descriptions:\nbringing a new product into an existing market\nbringing a new product into a new market\nbringing a new product into an existing market and trying to:\nre-segment that market as a low-cost entrant or\nre-segment that market as a niche entrant\ncloning a business model that’s successful in another country\nWhat confused entrepreneurs for decades is that the traditional product\nintroduction model works when introducing a product into an existing market\nwith a known business model (i.e., known customers, channels and markets).\nHowever, since the majority of startups are not pursuing known markets\n(those in new or re-segmented categories), they don’t really know who their\ncustomers will be. These types of startups are searching for a repeatable and\nscalable business model.\nMarket type influences everything a company does.\nMarket type influences everything a company does. Strategy and tactics\nthat work for one market type seldom work for another. Market type\ndetermines the startup’s customer feedback and acquisition activities and\nspending. It changes customer needs, adoption rates, product features and\npositioning as well as its launch strategies, channels and activities. In sum,\ndifferent market types require dramatically different discovery, MVPs, and\nsales and marketing strategies.\nIn existing markets, where customers exist, marketing is relatively easy:\nusers can describe the market and the attributes that matter the most to them.\nThe new product or service typically runs faster, does something better or\ncheaper, or otherwise improves on a customer-defined attribute. Users, the\nmarket, and competitors are known, and competition involves comparing the\nproduct and its features with others.\nIn a new market, a company lets customers do something they couldn’t do\nbefore by creating something that never existed before. Or it dramatically\nlowers costs to create a new class of users. By definition, new markets have\nno customers yet, so there’s nobody to know what the product can do or why\nthey should buy. This makes getting feedback and creating demand\nparticularly challenging, since the product is unknown to users and the\nmarket is undefined and unknown, and costly to develop.\nThe key isn’t competing, but instead understanding whether a large\ncustomer base exists and whether customers can be persuaded to buy. A\nclassic founder error in a new market is the “fast-burn” spending of sales and\nmarketing funds, a practice that may be appropriate when selling to existing\ncustomers in a known market, but makes no sense in a new market. The newvs.-existing axis is at the core of the market-type definition.\nRe-segmenting an existing market is useful when the incumbent is too\ndifficult to attack head-on (like Amazon, Facebook, or Microsoft). A resegmentation strategy is based on the startup’s market and customer\nknowledge, ideally identifying a market opportunity that incumbents are\nmissing, which usually takes one of two forms: a low-cost strategy or a niche\nstrategy. (Unlike differentiation, segmentation forges a distinct spot in\ncustomers’ minds that is unique, valuable, and in demand.)\nLow-cost re-segmentation is just what it sounds like. Are there\ncustomers at the low end of an existing market who will buy “good enough”\nperformance at a substantially lower price?\nNiche re-segmentation looks at an existing market and asks whether\nsome segment of this market would buy a new product designed to address\nmore specific needs. Can some sizable portion of the market be convinced\nthat a characteristic of the new product is radical enough to change the rules\nand shape of an existing market. See Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne’s\nwork on “Blue Ocean Strategy” for another way to think of re-segmenting a\nmarket.\nCloning an existing business model is a powerful technique when an\nexisting business has been proven in one country but has not yet been\nintroduced in another. Startups in Russia, India, Indonesia, Brazil, Japan and\nChina (each with its own large local market and language and cultural\nbarriers) can adopt, borrow, or copy a successful American business model\nand customize it for local language and buying preferences. (Soon ideas from\nthose countries will be cloned in the U.S.)\nFor example, Baidu in China and Yandex in Russia are the equivalent of\nGoogle in their respective markets. And Qzone, RenRen, PengYou and\nKaixin are the Facebooks of China, while Vkontakte and Odnoklassniki play\nthe same role in Russia.\nStartup companies generally enter one of these four market types and\nultimately must commit to one. The consequences of a wrong market-type\nchoice will prove to be severe in the customer creation stage. While market\ntype is ultimately a “late-binding decision,” a working hypothesis helps frame\nearly customer discovery issues. Market-type decision-making is explored in\ngreater detail in Chapter 4.\n...the few financial metrics to track: cash-burn rate,\nnumber of months’ worth of cash left...\nRule No. 8:\nStartup Metrics Differ from Those in Existing\nCompanies\nWe now have several centuries’ worth of performance metrics for existing\nbusinesses—P&Ls balance sheets, cash-flow forecasts and line-of-business\nanalyses, plus scores of others. Here’s hoping your startup becomes big\nenough to need them someday. In the past (not so long ago), we used these\ntools with startups because we didn’t know what else to measure. We now\nknow that startup metrics should focus on tracking the startup’s progress\nconverting guesses and hypotheses into incontrovertible facts rather than\nmeasuring the execution of a static plan. It’s critical that board and\nmanagement continuously test and measure each hypothesis until the entire\nbusiness model is worth scaling into a company.\nIf the company is venture-backed, management and investors must agree\non a set of metrics that truly matter and work toward a report or “dashboard”\nthat essentially replaces the P&L, cash flow, and balance sheet as\ncenterpieces of early board meetings.\nStartup metrics track the results of pass/fail tests and the iterations they lead\nto:\nHave the customer problem and product features been validated?\nDoes the minimum feature set resonate with customers?\nWho in fact is the customer, and have initial customer-related\nhypotheses on the likes of value proposition, customer segments, and\nchannels been validated through face-to-face customer interaction?\nCustomer-validation questions might include: average order size,\ncustomer lifetime value, average time to first order, rate of sales pipeline\ngrowth, improvement in close rate, and revenue per salesperson.\nIn addition to the startup metrics above, the relatively few financial\nmetrics that a startup board should be tracking are cash-burn rate, number of\nmonths’ worth of cash left, short-term hiring plans, and amount of time until\nthe company reaches cash-flow break-even.\nMake sure decisions are fact-based, not faith-based.\nRule No. 9:\nFast Decision-Making, Cycle Time, Speed and\nTempo\nSpeed matters at startups where the only absolute certainty is that the bank\nbalance declines every day. While Rule No. 4 addresses iterations and pivots,\nit doesn’t specify how long they should take. Unequivocally, the faster the\nbetter, since the faster these “learn, build, pivot” or “iterate, build” cycles\nhappen, the greater the odds of finding a scalable business model with the\ncash on hand. If cycles happen too slowly, the startup runs out of cash and\ndies. The biggest impediment to cycle time is psychological: it requires the\nadmission of being wrong or even of suffering a short-term tactical defeat.\nWhile pivots and iterations are about speed outside the building, speed\nalso matters inside the company. Most startup decisions are made in the face\nof uncertainty. There’s seldom a clear-cut, perfect solution to any\nengineering, customer or competitor problem, and founders shouldn’t\nagonize over trying to find one. This doesn’t mean gambling with the\ncompany’s fortunes on a whim. It means adopting plans with an acceptable\ndegree of risk and doing so quickly. (Make sure these decisions are factbased, not faith-based.) In general, the company that consistently makes and\nimplements decisions rapidly gains a tremendous, often-decisive competitive\nadvantage.\n...startups should make reversible decisions before\nanyone leaves the CEO’s office.\nStartup decisions have two states: reversible and irreversible. A\nreversible decision could be adding or dropping a product feature or a new\nalgorithm in the code or targeting a specific set of customers. If the decision\nproves a bad one, it can be unwound in a reasonable period of time. An\nirreversible decision such as firing an employee, launching a product, or\nsigning a long lease on expensive office space is usually difficult or\nimpossible to reverse.\nStartups should as policy, make reversible decisions before anyone\nleaves the CEO’s office or before a meeting ends. Perfect decision-making is\nboth unimportant and impossible, and what matters more is forward\nmomentum and a tight, fact-based feedback loop to quickly recognize and\nreverse bad decisions. By the time a big company gets the committee to get\nthe subcommittee to pick a meeting date, most startups have made 20\ndecisions, reversed five, and implemented the other 15.\nLearning to make decisions quickly is just part of the equation. Agile\nstartups have mastered another trick: tempo—the ability to make quick\ndecisions consistently and at all levels in the company. Speed and tempo are\nintegral parts of startup DNA, and a great startup’s tempo is often 10 times\nthat of a large company.\nRule No. 10:\nIt’s All About Passion\nA startup without driven, passionate people is dead the day it opens its doors.\n“Startup people” are different. They think different. In contrast, most people\nare great at execution. They work to live, do their jobs well, and enjoy their\nfamily, their lives, their hobbies and often even enjoy mowing the lawn.\nThey’re terrific at executing fixed tasks, and it’s a wonderful life for almost\neveryone.\nThe people leading almost every successful startup in history are just\ndifferent. They’re a very tiny percentage of the world population, and their\nbrains are wired for chaos, uncertainty, and blinding speed. They’re\nirrationally focused on customer needs and delivering great products. Their\njob is their life. It’s not 9-to-5, it’s 24/7. These are the people who found\nhigh-growth, highly-successful scalable startups.\nStartups demand execs who are comfortable with\nuncertainty, chaos and change.\nRule No. 11:\nStartup Job Titles Are Very Different from a Large\nCompany’s\nIn an existing company, job titles reflect the way tasks are organized to\nexecute a known business model. For example, the “Sales” title in an existing\ncompany means there’s a sales team repeatedly selling a known product to a\nwell-understood group of customers, using a standard corporate presentation\nwith an existing price list and standard terms, conditions and contract. The\n“Sales” title in an existing company is all about execution around a series of\nknowns.\nCompared with big companies, startups need executives whose skills are\n180 degrees different. Startups demand execs who are comfortable with\nuncertainty, chaos and change—with presentations and offers changing\ndaily, with the product changing often, with probing and gaining insights\nfrom failure rather than high-fiving a success. In short, they need the rare\nbreed:\nopen to learning and discovery—highly curious, inquisitive, and creative\neager to search for a repeatable and scalable business model\nagile enough to deal with daily change and operating “without a map”\nreadily able to wear multiple hats, often on the same day\ncomfortable celebrating failure when it leads to learning and iteration\nWe suggest replacing traditional execution-oriented sales, marketing and\nbusiness development titles with a single title: the Customer Development\nteam. At first, this “team” will consist of the company’s founder(s), who talks\nwith customers to gain enough insights to develop the minimum viable\nproduct. Later, as the startup moves into customer validation, the team may\ngrow to include a dedicated “sales closer” responsible for the logistics of\ngetting early orders signed. The closer shouldn’t be confused with a\ntraditional sales VP. To succeed in this process, the team must have:\nthe ability to listen to customer objections and understand whether they\nare issues about the product, the presentation, the pricing or something\nelse (or the wrong type of customer)\nexperience in talking to and moving between customers and engineers\nconfidence amid a state of constant change, often operating “without a\nmap”\nthe ability to walk in their customers’ shoes, understanding how they\nwork and the problems they face\nSome would say this checklist isn’t bad for identifying great entrepreneurs.\nRule No. 12:\nPreserve All Cash Until Needed. Then Spend.\nThe goal of Customer Development is not to avoid spending money but to\npreserve cash while searching for the repeatable and scalable business\nmodel. Once found, then spend like there’s no tomorrow. This paragraph is\nworth deconstructing:\nPreserve cash: When a startup has unlimited cash (Internet bubbles,\nfrothy venture climate), it can iterate on its mistakes by burning more dollars.\nWhen money is tight, without dollars to redo mistakes, it’s crucial to\nminimize waste. The Customer Development process preserves cash by not\nhiring any sales and marketing staff until the founders turn hypotheses into\nfacts and discover a viable product/market fit.\nWhile searching: Customer Development observes that at the start, the\ncompany and its business model are based solely on hypotheses, not facts,\nand that the founders need to get out of the building to turn these hypotheses\ninto customer data. This “get out of the building” approach, combined with\nrapid iteration and pivots, is central to the model’s customer discovery and\nvalidation steps.\n...preserve cash while searching for the repeatable\nand scalable business model...\nRepeatable: Startups may get orders that stem from board members’\ncustomer relationships, engineering one-offs, or heroic single-shot efforts by\nthe CEO. These are great, but they aren’t repeatable by a sales organization.\nSearch not for the one-off revenue hits but rather for a pattern that can be\nreplicated by a sales organization selling off a price list or by customers\nregularly visiting the website.\nScalable: The goal is not to get one customer but many—and for each\nadditional customer to add incremental revenue and profit. The test is: Does\nthe addition of one more salesperson or more marketing dollars bring in more\ngross profit (or users or clicks) than you invested? Who influences a sale?\nWho recommends a sale? Who is the decision-maker? Who is the economic\nbuyer? Where’s the budget for purchasing this type of product? What’s the\ncustomer acquisition cost? Affirming the repeatable, scalable sales model is\nthe customer validation step of Customer Development, its most important\nphase. Has the team learned how to sell a target customer? Can this happen\nbefore the startup runs out of money?\nSearch not for the one-off revenue hits but rather\nfor a pattern...\nBusiness model: A business model answers the basic questions of how\nthe company makes money. Is this a revenue play, or is it a freemium model\nseeking users? Something else? Who’s the customer?\nSpend like there’s no tomorrow: The goal of an investor-backed startup\nis not to build a lifestyle business. The goal is to reach venture scale (10\ntimes the return on investment or more). When management and board agree\nthat they’ve found a repeatable and scalable sales model (i.e., have a\nproduct/market fit), then invest the dollars to create end-user demand and\ndrive those customers into the sales channel.\nRule No. 13:\nCommunicate and Share Learning\nAn integral part of Customer Development’s “learning and discovery”\nphilosophy is sharing everything that’s learned outside the building with\nemployees, co-founders and even investors.\nThe traditional way to do this is via weekly company meetings to keep\nemployees informed and board meetings to let the investors understand the\nprogress made in the search for the business model. But technology in the\n21st-century has taken us to places we never could get to before. We can now\ncommunicate all we’re learning in near-real time to everyone who needs to\nknow.\nWe strongly recommend that the founders keep and share all their\nactivities in the customer discovery step via a blog, CRM or product\nmanagement tool. Think of it as a narrative of the customer discovery\nprocess. It records hypotheses the startup started with, who the team has\ntalked to, the questions asked, the tests conducted, what’s been learned, and\nquestions for advisors or investors. While this may seem burdensome, it takes\nless time than having a weekly coffee with an advisory board member. What\nresults is a communications tool allowing outsiders to view the company’s\nprogress up close and to offer suggestions and course corrections.\nRule No. 14:\nCustomer Development Success Begins With BuyIn\nCustomer Development’s “learning and discovery” philosophy can be\nimmensely disorienting to a founder, engineer or investor who has spent his\nor her career executing a plan. For Customer Development to succeed,\neveryone on the team—from investor or parent company to engineers,\nmarketeers and founders—needs to understand and agree that the Customer\nDevelopment process is different to its core. If the engineering VP is talking\nwaterfall development or the board demands a rigid timetable, Customer\nDevelopment is destined for disaster. Everyone must accept the process,\nrecognizing that this is a fluid, nonlinear search for a business model that can\nsometimes last for years.\nThe Customer Development process is different to\nits core.\nCustomer Development changes almost every aspect of startup behavior,\nperformance, metrics, and, as often as not, success potential. It’s not just a\n“nice to do” while executing the revenue model in the back of the business\nplan. Customer Development reinvents the business model on the fly,\niterating often and pivoting whenever indicated. Founders need to have the\ncommitment of the team and board before embarking on Customer\nDevelopment. Ensure that all understand and agree that it’s iterative,\nnecessary, and worthwhile and that it changes the benchmarks and metrics\nalong the way.\nComments such as “The product is already spec’ed, and we can’t change\nthe features since development is already underway,” or “We already have\nthe factory (or sales team or marketing materials) built,” or “We have to\nlaunch to make the numbers in the plan,” are all red flags. To succeed at\nCustomer Development, the company must abandon the old model’s\nemphasis on execution of a fantasy business plan. Instead it must commit to a\nCustomer Development process stressing learning, discovery, failure, and\niteration in the search for a successful business model. If you’re ready for this\nprocess, this book will tell you how to do it.\nSummary: The Customer Development\nProcess\nThe Customer Development process reflects the best practices of winning\nstartups. It is the only approach for web-based businesses where failure is\ncertain without constant customer feedback and product iteration as they\nsearch for their audiences. Customer Development’s fast cycle times and\ninherent cash conservation gives all entrepreneurs more chances to pivot,\niterate, and succeed before the bank account runs dry. Describe this model to\nentrepreneurs who have taken companies all the way to a lucrative exit and\nbeyond, and heads nod in recognition.\nWhile each step has its own specific objectives, the process as a whole\nhas one overarching goal: discovering the repeatable, scalable, and ultimately\nprofitable business before running out of cash. This transforms the company\nfrom a set of founding hypotheses into a moneymaking endeavor.\nCustomer Development is damn hard work. You\ncan’t fake it.\nCustomer Development is damn hard work. You can’t fake it. You can’t\njust do the slides or “do” the process in a weekend. It’s a full-time, full-bodycontact sport. It’s a long-term commitment to changing the way a startup is\nbuilt. But it’s also proven to increase the chances of startup success.\nOverview of the Customer Discovery Process\n\nCHAPTER 4\nAn Introduction to Customer Discovery\nNo startup business plan survives first contact with customers.\n—Steve Blank\nA journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.\n—Lao Tzu\nIRIDIUM WAS ONE OF THE BIGGEST STARTUP gambles ever made—a bold and\naudacious $5.2 billion bet. Founded by Motorola and a global partnership of\n18 companies in 1991, Iridium planned to build a mobile telephone system\nthat would work “anywhere on Earth,” from ships in the middle of the ocean\nto the jungles of Africa to remote mountain peaks where no cell towers\nexisted.\nHow? With an out-of-this-world business plan. First, the company\nbought a fleet of 15 rockets from Russia, the U.S. and China. Next, it\nlaunched an armada of 72 private satellites into orbit, where they acted like\n500-mile-high cell towers providing phone coverage to any spot on Earth.\nSeven years after Iridium’s founding, its satellites were in place. But nine\nmonths after the first call was made in 1998, the company was in Chapter 11\nbankruptcy. When Iridium crashed back to Earth, it ranked as one of the\nlargest startup failures on record. What went wrong?\nWhen Iridium was founded in 1991, worldwide cell-phone coverage was\nsparse, unreliable and expensive. Cell-phone handsets were the size of lunch\nboxes. Iridium put together a business plan that made assumptions about\ncustomers, their problems and the product needed to solve those problems.\nOther assumptions about sales channel, partnerships, and revenue model all\nadded up to a set of financial forecasts that Iridium would soon be printing\nmoney.\nOne of the largest startup failures on record as they\nexecuted their business plan.\nBut in the seven-plus years it took Iridium to go from concept to launch,\ninnovation in mobile- and cell-phone networks moved at blinding speed. By\nthe time Iridium launched, there were far fewer places on the planet where\ncell-phone service was unavailable. Traditional cell-phone companies\nprovided coverage in the most valuable parts of the world. Prices for cell\nservice shrunk as fast as phone handsets did. In contrast, Iridium’s satellite\nphone was bigger than a brick and weighed about as much. Worse, Iridium’s\ncell phone couldn’t make calls from cars or buildings, since it required lineof-sight “connection” to the satellites. Instead of 50 cents per minute for a\nregular cell call, Iridium’s calls cost $7 a minute, plus $3,000 for the handset\nitself.\nIridium’s potential market shrunk nearly every day. Instead of a massive\nworldwide market of potential users, it had drawn only a small group willing\nto pay its prices and put up with the product’s many limitations. But\nIridium’s business model assumptions and plans were firmly fixed as if it was\nstill 1991. The company spent $5 billion building a business over eight years\nwithout ever focusing on four key questions:\nHave we identified a problem a customer wants to see solved?\nDoes our product solve this customer problem or need?\nIf so, do we have a viable and profitable business model?\nHave we learned enough to go out and sell?\nAnswering these questions is the purpose of the first step in the\ncustomer discovery process. This chapter explains how to go about it.\n(Twenty years later, Iridium emerged from bankruptcy. In 2000, an\ninvestor group bought $6 billion worth of its assets for $25 million. After a\nlong climb back, the company celebrated its 500,000\nth customer in September\n2011.)\nCustomers don’t behave like your business plan.\nThe Customer Discovery Philosophy\nA startup begins with the vision of its founders: a vision of a new product or\nservice that solves a customer’s problems or needs and of how it will reach\nits many customers. Customer discovery lowers the odds of spending zillions\nand getting zeros in return as the Iridium team did. So the No. 1 goal of\ncustomer discovery amounts to this: turning the founders’ initial hypotheses\nabout their market and customers into facts.\nGet Out of the Building\nFacts exist only outside the building, where customers live, so the most\nimportant aspect of customer discovery is getting out of the building, in front\nof customers. And not for a few days or a week, but repeatedly, over weeks if\nnot months. This critical task can’t be assigned to junior staffers and must be\ndriven by founders. Only after the founders have performed this step will\nthey know whether they have a valid vision or just a hallucination.\nSounds simple, doesn’t it? But for anyone who has worked in\nestablished companies, the customer discovery process is disorienting. All the\nrules about new-product management in large companies are turned upside\ndown. It’s instructive to enumerate all things you are not going to do:\nunderstand the needs and wants of all customers\nmake a list of all the features customers want before they buy your\nproduct\nhand Product Development a features list of the sum of all customer\nrequests\nhand Product Development a detailed marketing-requirements document\nrun focus groups and test customers’ reactions to your product to see if\nthey will buy\nWhat you are going to do is develop your product for the few, not the\nmany. Moreover, you’re going to start building your product even before you\nknow whether you have any customers for it.\nOn a startups first day, there’s limited—if any—\ncustomer input.\nFor an experienced marketing or product management executive, these\nideas are not only disorienting and counterintuitive but heretical. Why aren’t\nthe needs of all potential customers important? What is it about a first\nproduct from a new company that’s different from follow-on products in a\nlarge company? What is it about a startup’s first customers that make the\nrules so different?\nSearch for the Problem/Solution Fit\nThe customer discovery process searches for problem/solution fit: “have we\nfound a problem lots of people want us to solve (or a need they want us to\nfill)” and “does our solution (a product, a website, or an app) solve the\nproblem in a compelling way?” At its core, the essence of customer discovery\nis to determine whether your startup’s value proposition matches the\ncustomer segment it plans to target.\nProblem/solution fit is virtually identical to what’s sometimes called\n“product/ market fit,” as the previous paragraph indicates. As a result, we use\nthe terms somewhat interchangeably throughout the book. Do realize,\nhowever, that in multi-sided markets, there may be multiple value\npropositions and multiple customer segments. But problem/solution fit is\nonly achieved when the revenue model, pricing, and customer acquisition\nefforts all match up with the customers’ needs.\nDevelop the Product for the Few, Not the Many\nIn existing companies, the goal of traditional product management and\nmarketing is to develop a market-requirements document (MRD) for\nengineering that contains the sum of all possible customer feature requests,\nprioritized in a collaborative effort among Product Management, Marketing,\nSales, and Engineering. Marketing or Product Management hosts focus\ngroups, analyzes sales data from the field, and looks at customer feature\nrequests and complaints. This information leads to the adding of requested\nfeatures to the product specification, and the engineering team builds them\ninto the next product release.\nWhile this process is rational for an established company entering an\nexisting market, it’s folly for startups. Why? Startups aren’t small versions of\nlarge, existing companies where there’s plenty of customer knowledge and\ninput. In established companies, the MRD process ensures that engineering\nwill build a product that appeals to existing customers in a known market,\nwhere customers and their needs are known. On a startup’s first day, there’s\nlimited—if any—customer input for creating a formal product specification.\nIn a startup, the first product is not designed to satisfy a mainstream\ncustomer. No startup can afford to build a product with every feature a\nmainstream customer needs all at once. The product would take years to get\nto market and be obsolete by the time it arrived. Instead, successful startups\nsolve this conundrum by focusing development and early selling efforts on a\nvery small group of early customers who have bought into the startup’s\nvision. These visionary customers will give the company the feedback\nnecessary to add features to the product over time.\nEarlyvangelists are willing to make a leap of faith\nand buy an early product.\nEarlyvangelists: The Most Important Customers of\nAll\nEnthusiasts who spread the good news about your product to friends, family\nor co-workers are often called evangelists. But a new word is needed to\ndescribe the early adopters—the visionary customers—who buy unfinished\nand untested products, because they want to “first,” whether it’s for the sake\nof gaining a competitive edge or winning bragging rights. We call these early\nadopters earlyvangelists. Unlike “mainstream” business or consumer-product\ncustomers who want to buy a finished, completed, tested product,\nearlyvangelists are willing to make a leap of faith and buy an early product\nfrom a startup. Every industry has a small subset of visionaries willing to take\na leap of faith on an early product.\nOne of the mistakes that startup founders make is to give away or\nheavily discount early alpha/beta products to blue-chip customers. In singlesided markets (where the user is the payer) earlyvangelists will be happy to\npay for early access to the product. If they won’t, they aren’t earlyvangelists.\nTheir willingness to pay is a critical part of the customer discovery process.\nYou’ll use it to test the entire buying process.\nEarlyvangelist Characteristics (Figure 4.1)\nIn web/mobile apps, where multi-sided markets (separate users and\npayers) are often found, earlyvangelists can be users or payers. But even as\nnonpaying users, these earlyvangelists are willing or eager accelerators of\nyour viral growth.\nEarlyvangelists are willing or eager accelerators of\nyour viral growth.\nIn both physical and web/mobile channels, earlyvangelists display these\ncommon characteristics (see Figure 4.1):\nThey have a problem or need.\nThey understand they have a problem.\nThey’re actively searching for a solution and have a timetable for\nfinding it.\nThe problem is so painful that they’ve cobbled together an interim\nsolution.\nThey’ve committed, or can quickly acquire, budget dollars to purchase.\nThink of earlyvangelists’ characteristics along a scale of customer pain.\nEarlyvangelist customers will be found only at the top of the scale—those\nwho have already been looking for a solution, built a home-grown solution\n(whether in a company by building a software solution or at home by taping\ntogether a fork, a light bulb and a vacuum cleaner) and have or can acquire a\nbudget. These people are perfect earlyvangelist candidates. They can be\nrelied on for feedback and initial sales; they’ll tell others about the product\nand spread the word that the vision is real. Moreover, they can be potential\nadvisory board candidates.\nBuild a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) First\nThe idea that a startup builds its product for a small group of initial customers\nrather than devising a generic mainstream spec is radical. What follows is\nequally revolutionary.\nThe goal of the MVP is to build the smallest possible\nfeature set.\nOn the day the company starts, there is very limited customer input. All\nthe startup has is a vision of what the problem, product and solution seem to\nbe. Unfortunately, it’s either a vision or a hallucination. The company doesn’t\nknow who its initial customers are or what features they’ll want. One option\nis to start developing an entire full-featured first release of the product, with\nevery feature the founders can think of. We now know this results in wasted\nengineering effort, time and cash, as customers don’t use, want or need most\nof the features developed without their input.\nAnother path is to put Product Development on hold until the Customer\nDevelopment team can find customers who can provide adequate feedback.\nThe risk here is lost time and no product for customers to provide feedback\nagainst. A third, more productive approach is to develop the core features of\nthe product (incrementally and iteratively with agile engineering methods),\nwith the feature list driven by the vision and experience of the company’s\nfounders. This is a minimum viable product.\nThe goal of customer discovery is to test your understanding of the\ncustomer’s problem and see if your proposed solution will prompt him to use\nor buy the product based on its most important features alone. Most users\nwant finished products, but earlyvangelists are the perfect target for the MVP.\nTailor the initial product release to satisfy their needs. If no one thinks your\nMVP solution is interesting or sufficient, iterate or pivot until an adequate\nnumber say “yes.”\nThe shift in thinking to an incremental and iterative MVP as opposed to\na fully featured first product release is important. Engineers tend to make a\nproduct bigger and more perfect. The MVP helps them focus the most\nimportant and indispensable features. Your goal in having an MVP is not to\ngather feature requests to change the product or to make the feature set larger.\nInstead, the goal is to put the MVP in front of customers to find out whether\nyou understood the customer problem well enough to define key elements of\nthe solution. Then you iteratively refine the solution. If, and only if, no\ncustomers can be found for the most important features of the MVP, bring\ncustomers’ additional feature requests to the product development team. In\nthe Customer Development model, feature requests to an MVP are by\nexception and iteration rather than by rule. This eliminates the endless list of\nfeature requests that often delay first customer ship and drive product\ndevelopment teams crazy.\nMVPs for Web/Mobile Are Different\nWeb/mobile businesses conduct customer discovery differently from those in\nthe physical channel. They can reach hundreds or thousands more customers\nby combining online and face-to-face interactions. They place a greater\nemphasis on customer acquisition, activation, and referrals. Web/mobile\nminimum viable products can be developed faster and delivered earlier,\naccelerating the discovery process. When delivered, they can conduct more\ntests with customers, with more granular customer-response data. This results\nin a faster iteration of the problem statement, the proposed solution, and the\nMVP itself.\nUse the Business Model Canvas as The Customer\nDiscovery Scorecard\nOften there’s a lack of a shared and clear understanding of the business\nmodel throughout the company. This customer discovery step uses Alexander\nOsterwalder’s business model canvas to diagrammatically illustrate how a\ncompany intends to make money. As shown in Figure 4.2 the canvas\nrepresents any company in nine boxes, depicting the details of a company’s\nproduct, customers, channels, demand creation, revenue models, partners,\nresources, activities and cost structure. (We described the business model\ncanvas in detail in the Customer Development Manifesto.)\nBusiness Model Canvas (Figure 4.2)\nIn this phase you’ll develop a one- or two-page brief about each of the\nfollowing boxes in the business model canvas:\nMarket Size: how big the opportunity is\nValue Proposition, Part 1: the product/service, its benefits and minimum\nviable product\nCustomer Segments: who the customer is and what problems the\nproduct solves\nChannels: how the product will be distributed and sold\nCustomer Relationships: how demand will be created\nValue Proposition, Part 2: market-type hypothesis and competitive set/\ndifferentiation\nKey Resources: suppliers, commodities, or other essential elements of\nthe business\nKey Partners: other enterprises essential to success of the business\nRevenue Streams: revenue and profit sources and size\nWhen you first draft your initial hypotheses your canvas begins to fill\nup, looking like Figure 4.3.\nSample Business Model Canvas—Initial Hypotheses (Figure 4.3)\nBut in addition to using the business model canvas as a static snapshot\nof the business at a single moment, frozen in time, Customer Development\nuses the canvas as a “scorecard” to track progress in searching for a business\nmodel.\nOnce a week update the canvas to reflect any pivots or iterations,\nhighlighting in red the changes from the last week.\nThen after you and your team agree on the changes to your business\nmodel, integrate them into what becomes your new canvas for the week (the\naccepted changes in red are then shown in black). During the next week any\nnew changes are again shown in red. Then the process repeats each week –\nnew changes showing up in red. Then a new canvas used for the week.\nThis method highlights the changes over time for your and the team’s\nreference. Figure 4.4 shows how the canvases will look over time.\nUsing the Business Model Canvas as a Weekly Scorecard (Figure 4.4)\nHad they read this book, and gotten out of the building, the folks at\nIridium might have saved billions by learning just how small the market for\ntheir business had become. It would have allowed them to search for\nalternatives and survival.\nTo sum up the customer discovery philosophy: whether there’s\nproduct/market fit by finding earlyvangelists, understanding their needs, and\nverifying that the initial minimum viable product solves a problem they’ll\neagerly pay to have solved. And if not, use near-continuous customer\nfeedback to drive agile, frequent changes in product and business model\nalike.\nAs you complete the hypothesis development, your business model\ncanvas quickly becomes multi-dimensional. You are really developing three\ninitial canvases:\nCore elements of the business model itself (value proposition, channel,\netc.)\nHypotheses you have for each element of the business model (such as\n“people will want these features, “or “customers will buy our product\nbecause...”)\nAnd a layer outlining the key pass/fail tests you will use to get face-toface with customers and use their feedback to convert your hypotheses\ninto facts.\nOverview of Customer Discovery\nCustomer Discovery: Overview of the Process (Figure 4.5)\nCustomer Discovery has Four Phases\nPhase 1 deconstructs the founders’ vision into the nine parts of the business\nmodel canvas (product, customers, channels, demand creation, revenue\nmodels, partners, resources, activities and cost structure). Then your team\nwrites one-page briefs about each of the hypotheses, including the list of\nexperiments or tests you’ll need to conduct to prove or disprove each one.\nIn Phase 2 you conduct experiments to test your “problem” hypotheses. This\nhelps you understand how important the problem is and how big it can\nbecome. You do so by testing most elements of the business model, including\nthe value proposition, pricing, channel strategy, and sales process. Your goal\nis to turn hypotheses into facts or discard them if they’re wrong, and replace\nthem with new hypotheses. In the process, you’ll gain a deep understanding\nof customers’ business, workflow, organization, and product needs. When all\nthe facts are in, update your results on the canvas.\nWeb-based products and channels often implement much of Phase 2\nonline in near-real time.\nIn Phase 3, you test your “solution,” presenting your value proposition\n(product, pricing, features, and other business model components) and the\nminimum viable product to customers and compare their responses to the\n“pass/fail” goals you developed earlier. For a web-based product, the\nMVP is a live site, a live demo, or a feature or piece of functionality or\ncontent. The goal is not to sell the product, but to validate how well you\nunderstood the problem in Phase 2 when you heard customers say, “Even\nthese minimum features solve our problems,” or, “I need this product.”\nIdeally, customers ask, “When can I get it?”\nOnline, customers should engage and interact, spend time on it or\nwith it, appear in droves, come back again and again, and bring their friends.\nIn Phase 4 you stop and assess the results of the experiments you’ve\nconducted and verify that you have:\na full understanding of customers’ problems, passions, or needs\nconfirmed the value proposition solves problems, passions or needs\ndetermined that a sizable volume of customers exists for the product\nlearned what customers will pay for the product\nmade certain the resulting revenue should deliver a profitable business\nWith your product features and business model validated, decide\nwhether you have learned enough to go out and try to sell a select your\nproduct to a few visionary customers, or whether you need to go back to\ncustomers to learn some more. If, and only if, you are successful in this step\ndo you proceed to customer validation.\nThat’s customer discovery in a nutshell. The remainder of this section\ndetails each of the phases just described.\nNow let’s get started.\nOverview of the Customer Validation Process\n\nCHAPTER 5\nIntroduction to Customer Validation\nAlong the journey we commonly forget its goal.\n—Friedrich Nietzsche\nE.PIPHANY’S FOUNDING HYPOTHESES WERE typically pretty straightforward\nand “investable” in the mid-1990s, when software companies were\nautomating everything from accounts payable to network security, sales force\nprocesses and even wine-cellar inventories. “Why not automate the marketing\ndepartment?” asked the founders, meeting in their modest living room. “After\nall, most of the tasks like press releases and data sheets and customer letters\nare repeatable processes.” Venture capital was raised and the company began\nto build its product based on the founders’ vision.\nHowever, the company’s initial idea of who the customer was and the\nproblem they wanted to solve was just plain wrong. The company’s later\nsuccess was due to the four passionate entrepreneurs’ willingness to listen to\ncustomers and to the three painful pivots driven by customer feedback.\nThe Browser Breakthrough\nDuring the ’90s, large corporations acquired different software applications to\nautomate each part of their enterprise—finance, customer support,\nmanufacturing, and sales among them. But the data these applications\ncollected were accessed via reporting tools from the IT organization. More\nimportant, the data existed in “virtual silos,” with each functional system\nwalled off from the other. The finance system didn’t talk to the sales system,\nwhich didn’t know that the manufacturing system even existed. Queries like\n“Compare the sales data of green dresses versus blue ones with current\ninventory for each by store, and contrast the gross margin by region to\ncalculate discounts” were virtually impossible to answer to because they\nrequired combining data from three incompatible applications. As a result, it\ncould often take days or even weeks to get a simple inventory-detail report.\nE.piphany’s then-radical notion was to provide managers\nanytime/anywhere drill-downs and analysis in real time, without IT, through\na revolutionary new technology called a web browser. One of the company’s\nkey hypotheses was that the product should be a great fit for companies with\nlots of customers, tons of data on each one, and a recurring need for fast new\ndata-driven, microsegmented marketing campaigns.\nAn Epiphany at E.piphany\nEarly on, E.piphany assembled an advisory board. A key adviser was the VP\nof database marketing at Schwab. She was incredibly generous with her time\nand said the system might work in their application. She introduced the\ncompany to five other database marketing executives, who essentially said,\n“If you get a system working at Schwab, we’ll have to buy one as well.” You\ncouldn’t get much better than that. E.piphany had found its first\nearlyvangelist and first market.\nBut each time Schwab’s people looked at the system’s technical details,\nthey politely said our product was missing a key feature for database\nmarketing. It took two meetings before the founders realized they understood\nher problem, all right, but the solution—the underlying database schema of\nthe software—was missing the most important feature for solving it. It didn’t\ninclude “householding,” and without this feature, she could never buy the\nE.piphany system. (Householding, well-known among database marketers,\nrecognizes that two or more people at the same physical address live together\nand, in Schwab’s case, often invest together. This feature was crucial to\ndirect-marketers who didn’t want to send multiple or differing ads to the\nsame address.) And no amount of sales and marketing hand-waving was\ngoing to fix the problem.\nIt was a major mistake. Until this meeting, the founders hadn’t\nunderstood the customer problem well enough to provide the correct solution.\nE.piphany’s co-founders, Ben Wegbreit and Steve Blank, joined the\nSchwab VP, and her engineering team in a deep technical discussion of what\nthe software needed to do for Schwab’s business and what was needed. Ben\nasked five or 10 questions, everybody nodded and the meeting ended. On the\nlong ride back to E.piphany’s living-room office, Steve asked, “Ben, how do\nwe solve Schwab’s problem?”\nAfter a moment of silence, he replied, “Show them page 6 of our\nproduct spec.”\n“What do you mean page 6? Our spec only has five pages!”\nBen looked at Steve and smiled. “Not anymore.”\nThey had just pivoted the product and refined the minimum feature set.\nE.piphany’s first order from Schwab came the week after they demo’ed\nhouseholding. Other orders followed soon after. A week later, the founders\nsat down to figure out what other feature they would toss out to make room\nfor this one.\nE.piphany would go through two additional equally painful pivots\nbefore its initial public offering, but that “householding” pivot sold the\nfounders on the “power of the pivot” value.\nThe meeting and car ride from Schwab to the company headquarters\nillustrates the customer validation process every startup needs: a method for\nvalidating the business model with real customers and orders.\nCustomer validation turns hypotheses into facts about basic questions\nlike:\n• Do we understand the sales/user acquisition process?\nIs it repeatable?\nCan we prove it’s repeatable? (If our business model is single-sided\ncommerce, the only acceptable proof is enough full-price orders.)\nCan we get these orders/users with the current product?\n• Have we tested sales and distribution channels?\n• Are we confident we can scale orders/users into a profitable business?\n• Have we correctly positioned the product and the company?\nThe Customer Validation Philosophy\nCustomer validation attempts to “test sell” at every stage. It runs a continuing\nseries of quantitative pass/fail tests to determine whether there’s strong\nenough product/market fit to justify scaling sales and marketing spending.\nMost of your testing effort will be asking people to give you an order or\nengage with your app or website. At this point, you’re testing the entire\nbusiness model, not its individual components, even as you learn more details\nabout some, like price or channel.\nJust as customer discovery was disorienting for experienced marketers,\nthe customer validation process turns the world upside down for experienced\nsalespeople and, in particular, those with sales responsibility. All the rules\nsales executives learned while selling in physical channels at large companies\nare not applicable to startups. In fact, they’re positively detrimental. It’s not\nall about the launch party!\nIn the customer validation step, you are not going to hire and staff a\nsales team. You are not going to execute to a sales plan or “the sales\nstrategy.” The reality is that you don’t know enough yet to do any of these\nthings. At the end of customer discovery, you have in hand firm hypotheses\nabout who will buy, why they will buy, and at what price they will buy. But\nuntil those hypotheses are validated—with customer orders—they’re all little\nmore than educated guesses, even with the work invested to develop them.\nFrom Business Model Canvas to the Sales Roadmap\nIn customer discovery you tested some of the hypotheses of your business\nmodel:\nValue proposition: You affirmed it with a few dozen to a few hundred\npeople\nCustomer segments: You have a hypothesis about customer archetypes\nCustomer relationships: You tested several “get, keep and grow”\nactivities\nChannel: You understand your key channel partners, and some have\nexpressed interest\nRevenue model: The company has an idea of how to price its offering\nA sales roadmap uses all you’ve learned from customer discovery to\nguide the creation of a sales funnel specifically for your company. It answers:\nWho influences a sale? Who recommends a sale?\nWho is the decision-maker? Who is the economic buyer? The saboteur?\nWhere is the budget for purchasing the type of product you’re selling?\nHow many sales calls are needed to make one sale?\nHow long does an average sale take from beginning to end?\nWhat is the selling strategy? Is this a solution sale?\nIf so, what are “key customer problems?”\nWhat’s the profile of optimal visionary buyers, the earlyvangelists every\nstartup needs?\nWhere will the traffic come from? Will it stick?\nWill the product be strong enough to grow virally?\nUnless a company has proven answers to these questions, few sales will\nhappen, and those that do occur will result from heroic single-shot efforts. Of\ncourse, on some level, most sales VPs realize they lack the knowledge they\nneed to draw a detailed sales roadmap, but most believe they and their newly\nhired sales team can acquire this information while simultaneously selling\nand closing orders. This is because most executives new to startups confuse\nsearching for a business model with the execution of a known business model.\nA sales roadmap is part of the search for a business model. Only after it’s\nbuilt can it be executed. Startups can’t learn and discover while they’re busy\nexecuting. As we can see from the rubble of any number of failed startups,\nattempting to execute before you have a sales roadmap in place is pure folly.\nBuilding a Sales Roadmap Versus Building a Sales\nForce\nGiven how critical the validation step is, a CEO’s first instinct is to speed up\nthe process by spending more on customer acquisition or adding salespeople.\nThe reality is, this doesn’t speed up the validation phase. In fact, it most often\nslows it down. Instead, you’ll build a roadmap to figure out how to get\nrepeatable sales (by explicitly testing product/ market fit). Once that’s done,\nthen build a sales organization.\nDeveloping a sales roadmap is part of the search for\na business model.\nIn an existing market, customer validation may simply validate that the\nsales VP’s rolodex or contact list is relevant, and that product performance\nmetrics the company identified in customer discovery were correct. In a resegmented, clone or new market, even a rolodex of infinite size (or tripling\nthe AdWords budget) won’t substitute for a proven business model and a\ntested sales roadmap.\nFor an experienced sales or business development executive, these\nstatements about customer validation are heretical. All the actions in\nCustomer Development we consider to be mistakes are what traditional sales\nprofessionals have been trained to do. It seems counterintuitive and\ndisorienting. So let’s look more closely at why the first sales in a startup are\nso different from later-stage sales or selling in a large company.\nFounders Must Lead the Customer Validation\nTeam\nFounders who complete customer discovery often mistakenly ease up and\ndelegate customer validation activities to Sales, Business Development,\nMarketing or Product Management. This is a bad idea. Middle and junior\nmanagers aren’t likely to be good at customer validation, which requires\ncreative searching, probing, and turning on a dime—not execution of a\nrepeatable process.\nWhy must the founders lead? First, founders and only founders call the\nshots on pivoting. To do so, they must hear about flaws in the product or\nbusiness model directly from the customers. Nothing else has the same\nimpact. Anyone other than a founder who learns of a serious product or\nbusiness-plan flaw faces two challenges: he or she doesn’t have the authority\nto pivot, and he or she seldom has the courage to report bad customer\nfeedback to the founder.\nIn web/mobile channels, where there’s much more feedback to\nprocess, the founders still make the call about pivots, but the company needs\nto have data junkies, A/B testers, statisticians, and SEO/PPC experts, as well\nas at least one or two wildly creative online marketers. (This might be\nphysically embodied in the founder and one or two amazing people.) This\nteam will measure, assess, manage and improve the acquisition, or Get\nCustomers, funnel. As they’re getting “out of the building” digitally, a\ncustomer development team also leaves physically for face-to-face customer\nvalidation, and for deal-making that drives traffic or referrals.\nValidation Proceeds at Different Speeds in Different\nChannels\nIt takes far more time to set up visits in a physical channel with prospects in\ncellphone companies in Asia and Africa than to get customer feedback\nelectronically for a website. And more customers can be reached via\nweb/mobile channels than can ever be met face-to-face.\nCustomer validation for web/mobile startups always proceeds faster\nwith many more iterations than it does with physical channels and goods.\nWhy? It’s all bits that can be changed. Regardless of speed, the fundamental\nprinciples of customer validation are identical across all channels.\nMake Early Sales to Earlyvangelists\nIn customer validation you will target Earlyvangelists as your first paying\ncustomers. (If you can’t sell to them, it doesn’t get better over time.)\nConstrain Spending in Customer Validation\nA typical failure scenario for startups is premature scaling, when there are\nmore salespeople in the field burning cash than are needed while your\nbusiness model is still unproven. Or running expensive demand-creation\nactivities before you’re sure who your customers really are. Too often those\nsales people are fired and their marketing programs killed when the startup\nfaces a major pivot after scaling too early. Customer validation delays salesand-marketing hiring and spending until validation is nearly complete. This\nconstraint is central to the process, which assumes startups will fail and\niterate often. The spending constraint keeps enough cash in the bank to fund\nmultiple pivots on the road to success.\nPrioritize What Needs to be Validated\nPrioritizing the business model elements that need validating is essential at\nthe start of customer validation. Every startup business model has a zillion\nmoving parts. Validation can’t possibly measure and affirm every variable or\nthe founders will be 100 years old by the time they’re ready to scale—or,\nworse, exit—the business.\nThe business model canvas is an excellent guide here. Most startups will\nfocus on the four core elements: value proposition, customer relationships,\nchannel, and revenue model. This list works for many businesses but not all.\nMulti-sided markets need to prioritize all sides of the market. Think about the\nfive or fewer things that will make this a huge, successful business—or not.\nWhy Accountants Don’t Run Startups\nWith all the process steps involved, it’s sometimes hard to remember that the\nCustomer Development process isn’t a giant focus group. The goal is not to\nadd up all the customer feedback and vote on what features to implement.\nFounders who are artists at heart run startups—the true purpose of Customer\nDevelopment is to inform their vision. (In a new market, there’s no data at\nall!) A great entrepreneur may consider all the customer data, listen to his\ninstincts and say, “Here’s why I’m going to ignore what we just heard.”\nAnd Finally: Don’t Be Afraid to Let Go When\nLightning Strikes\nOccasionally, fast-scaling web/mobile startups with viral or network-effect\ndrivers find the business suddenly blasting off, even if this book doesn’t\nsuggest that it should happen yet. This occurred at Google, YouTube,\nFacebook, and Twitter, to name an elite few. If you’re lucky enough to hit a\nconsumer nerve as hard as they did, put this book down and hold on to the\nrocket ship. After all, that’s what entrepreneurs do! (Skim the book another\ntime on your private jet or yacht or Sunfish.)\nThe Customer Validation Philosophy, in Summary\nCustomer discovery first tested your hypotheses about the company’s\nbusiness model with a relatively tiny group of customers who were asked for\nopinions, not orders. Discovery itself didn’t deliver any proven, hard facts\nabout who would buy or how scalable the business was.\nCustomer validation goes to the next step and determines whether a\nproduct/market fit can be validated by orders or usage. It does so by further\ndeveloping the MVP as well as the company’s sales and marketing plans and\nmaterials. Then it gets founders out of the building (physically, virtually, or\nboth) to test the MVP and every other key business model hypotheses,\nincluding product features, pricing, channel, and positioning. How? By\nasking for orders (or downloads, logons, or clicks)!\nTest the MVP. How? By asking for orders.\nCustomer validation is complete when the company has answers to these\nthree questions:\n1. Can the business scale? Will a dollar spent on customer acquisition\nyield more than a dollar’s worth of incremental revenue, page views,\ndownloads or clicks?\n2. Is there a repeatable and scalable sales roadmap? Does the company\nknow the right prospects to call on or acquire, and what to say to them to\nconsistently deliver sales?\n3. Is the sales funnel predictable? Do the same sales programs and tactics\nconsistently deliver an adequate, profitable flow of customers through\nthe funnel?\nNow let’s get started.\nOverview of the Customer Validation Process\nCustomer Validation: Overview of the Process (Figure 5.1)\nCustomer Validation has Four Phases\nPhase 1 consists of six “get ready to sell” activities; product positioning,\nsales/ marketing materials for “test selling” efforts, the hiring of a sales\ncloser, the creation of a distribution channel plan, refining a sales roadmap,\nand creating an advisory board. These activities make your team the best\nprepared early stage venture ever to hit the streets.\nCompanies in web/mobile channels also have six “get ready to sell”\nactivities: Product Positioning, assembling Acquire/Activate Plans, building\nthe high-fidelity MVP, building the metrics toolset, hiring a “data chief” and\ncreating an advisory board. They help deliver lean, cost-effective customer\nacquisition programs.\nPhase 2 gets founders out of the building to put the product to the ultimate\ntest: will customers validate your business model by buying your product?\nYou’ll attempt to actually sell customers an unfinished and unproven product\nwithout a professional sales organization. Getting feedback is as important as\ngetting orders. Startups in the physical channel do this with brochures,\nPowerPoints, sales materials and, where possible, product demos or mockups.\nDozens if not hundreds of meetings help refine the product presentation and\nchannel plans, validate the sales roadmap, prove the predictability of the sales\nfunnel, and validate that the business model is repeatable, scalable and\nprofitable in a real-world test.\nWeb/mobile startups “go live” and get out of the building virtually to\nsee if their plans and tools to acquire customers actually attract customers\nwho activate or buy. Do more than a handful of real customers behave as the\nhypotheses suggest they will? Acquisition and activation activities are\nmeasured and optimized.\nStartups in multi-sided markets (physical or web/mobile) need to get out\nof the building to test each side of the market. Web/Mobile marketers first\ntest users and then validate a different set of hypotheses (value proposition,\nsegment, revenue model, etc.) with the “payers,” who are marketers or\nadvertisers willing to pay to reach people using the site for free.\nPhase 3 happens once you have a couple of orders under your belt and\nenough customer information to develop and refine your product and\ncompany positioning. The positioning is tested in meetings with industry\npundits and analysts and face-to-face with the expanded customer audience.\nWeb/mobile startups refine their “Get” program tactics. Then they\nconduct initial product positioning, next they gather and organize the\ncustomer behavior data collected in Phase 2: customer responses to “Get”\nactivities and metrics summarizing their initial on-site behavior. They collect\nfeedback about the MVP itself and the effectiveness of acquisition tools.\nPhase 4 stops all activity for long enough to conduct a detailed pivot-orproceed analysis and verify that, regardless of channel, customer validation is\ncomplete and the company knows how to scale. If so, it’s ready to reap the\nrewards for founders and investors alike. But first there are lots of tough\nquestions and hard work to verify.\nIn sum, the question is simple: “is this a business worth doing,” and\ndevoting several years of backbreaking work? Will it generate enough\nrevenue, growth and profits to achieve the founders’ and investors’ goals?\nAnd has the team learned enough to make it happen?\nOdds are overwhelming that the optimum business model won’t be\nfound on the first or second try in validation.\nThe moment customer validation is over is when it’s clear that there are\nreal orders, users, or clicks—not surveys or chats. Customer validation\nconfirms that customers will accept the minimum viable product, proves that\nthe customers exist, figures out how to reach them predictably, and crafts a\nscalable plan to engage and sell many more. It’s often called the “epiphany\nmoment.”\n\nCHAPTER 6\nCustomer Validation: The Toughest\nQuestion of All: Pivot or Proceed?\nTHIS IS THE MOST CRITICAL, MOST GUT-WRENCHING phase of customer\nvalidation: honestly determining whether there’s a scalable, profitable\nbusiness model ahead. Is the company ready to go forward to the customer\ncreation step, when millions of dollars are often spent to fuel rapid customer\ngrowth? This step literally “calls the question” about the company’s future\ndirections. It’s time to study all the test results, all the customer learning and\nall the insights you’ve had from the facts you’ve gathered. Its time to see if\nthe company is ready to start spending money to scale, and that the result will\nbe a great, profitable company.\nThere are three steps to answering the crucial “pivot or proceed” question:\nAssemble and review all key discovery and validation findings\nReview the business model hypotheses and their interactions with one\nanother\nFocus on the “metrics that matter” in the financial model\nPivot or Proceed: Assemble Data Findings\nBy this point, the team has assembled a massive amount of hard data:\nindustry research, customer segments, customer feedback, marketing\nprogram results, channel and cost input and much more. The data needs to be\nverified, with any gaps, discrepancies, or anomalies filled in along the way. A\nfew examples:\nThe company needs 10,000 customers in order to be profitable, but the\nmarket isn’t that large\nCustomer acquisition or channel costs are too high, rendering the\ncompany unprofitable\nThe sales roadmap is too long and complex, making the cost of sales\nway too high\nDespite best efforts, referrals just aren’t delivering additional customers\nThese anomalies are relatively easy to spot when all the data is collected\nin one room. They often call for further customer, channel, or product\ndevelopment discussions. At times, they drive a business model pivot.\nThe best way to “translate” piles of data, is to make\nit as visual as possible.\nBuild a War Room\nThe best way to “translate” piles of data, reports and questionnaires is to\nmake it as visual as possible. For best results, lock the founding team in a\nroom for a day or two to walk step by step through each hypothesis. Cover\none wall with a blown up “final” business model canvas. Cover the other wall\nwith the hypotheses themselves, sorted to keep the pieces of each hypothesis\ntogether (remember, many hypotheses have multiple parts). Use another wall\nfor supporting diagrams, and allow space for the most recent canvas and\nperhaps one or two earlier iterations. Leave a large whiteboard available for\nkeeping score of questions and changes and for the key “metrics that matter”\nnumbers that emerge (discussed in detail in Step 3). While not every diagram\nis appropriate for your startup, review:\na work-flow map of the prototypical customer that diagrams how\ncustomers do their jobs or live their lives both with and without the new\nproduct\nan organizational/influence map showing whom consumers or\nbusinesspeople interact with, how often, and how those people influence\nbuying decisions.\ncustomer archetypes: how they earn and spend their money and use their\ntime\na market map showing where your customers will come from\na channel or sales roadmap diagramming how sales will happen\na fully updated business model canvas (along with a few earlier\nversions)\nReview the Data\nThe most important hard data to review includes:\ncustomer feedback, particularly from sales report cards evaluating\ncustomer enthusiasm for the product and its potential sales revenue over\ntime\nmarket size and market share estimates\nchannel feedback and revenue potential summaries\npricing, customer acquisition costs, and any major product cost changes\ndetailed information about the industry, the customers, and their\nbehavior\ncompetitive product and pricing information\nresults of your web “get, keep and grow” tests\ndetails of your customer acquisition costs and viral coefficient and the\nlatest stats on page views per visit, visit frequency, user growth, and\nretention optimization\nuser-testing results, showing the rate of improvement for activation,\nconversion, retention and growth activities\nThe team, often including investors, should review all the materials to\nensure that all the learning from discovery and validation has been integrated\ninto the latest versions of the hypothesis documents and into an updated\nversion of the business model canvas that will be discussed in the next step.\nThe key activity at this stage is to look at the intersections of, or interactions\namong, the business model components, since no doubt many components\nhave changed along the way. The process is a healthy one, and the results\nfuel the next steps of the pivot-or-proceed process.\nLook at the intersections of, or interactions among\nthe business model components.\nThe Business Model Checklist (Figure 6.2) gives you and your\nmanagement team the questions you should be asking and worrying about.\nPrint them out. Keep them handy. And worry “Am I going to bet my\ncompany that I got them right?”\nPivot or Proceed: Validate Your Business Model\nIt’s been a long road but you’ve converted most of your business model\nhypotheses from customer discovery into facts. You’ve done so by extensive\ntesting through face-to-face customer interactions. So, if the customerrelationships hypothesis said one of every five acquired customers will\nactivate and pay for the service or app, this actually happened in validation,\nwith hundreds if not thousands of customers. Or you’ve proven that people\nreturn to the product or app three times a week for an average of 20 minutes\nper visit or spend $100 a month visiting once.\nReview Business Model Hypotheses (Figure 6.1)\nThe team should assemble data collected in the last phase in its “war\nroom” use the checklist to walk through the business model hypotheses, box\nby box, and ascertain that there are factual, definitive answers to at least\nevery question on the checklist.\nIn this final phase of customer validation the company asks itself the\nsame questions it asked in Phase 4 of customer discovery. But at this point, it\nshould have much more quantitative, irrefutable proof of the answers, since\nyou’ve spoken to far more customers and conducted many more tests.\nWeb/mobile startups have a unique set of business model hypotheses\nthat they need to validate, particularly in the “Get/Keep/Grow” Customer\nRelationships area. These questions include:\nHas the company proven it can acquire and activate a steadily-increasing\nnumber of customers at a cost in line with the cost structure?\nAre the customers being acquired demonstrating that they will spend\nand “stick” with the company at rates that will deliver the revenue plan?\nAnd are customers referring other good quality customers in sufficient\nnumbers to deliver these often-free new customers, reducing the average\nacquisition cost?\nIn multi-sided markets, are customers visiting often enough,\nparticipating actively enough, and staying active long enough to help the\ncompany generate the revenues it needs to succeed?\nThe Business Model Canvas as a Scorecard\nHopefully you’ve been taking regular snapshots of your business model\ncanvas – either week-by-week snapshots, or at least at each major pivot. If\nyou’ve done it this way you now essentially have a film strip of the\nentrepreneurial process.\nAs you can see from Figure 6.1, each stage of discovery and validation\nrefined the canvas. Experiments were run, learning caused iterations and a\nfew pivots, and all were documented in a new canvas (reread here).\nNow that you have your canvases up on the wall use them as a point of\ndiscussion.\nThe answers to “Is this a business?” can be found in\nthe results of the multitude of tests you’ve\nconducted throughout the validation process.\nThe answers to “Is this a business?” can be found in the results of the\nmultitude of tests you’ve conducted throughout the validation process. As is\noften the case, when the results aren’t convincing enough, or when they don’t\ndeliver the traffic or financial targets of the business model, it’s time to iterate\nor pivot, and retest to see if the new approach improves the results. After all,\nthe company will very shortly be spending millions of dollars in the customer\ncreation phase, where results are expected to be far more predictable, and\nmuch more is at risk. While this may seem ambitious and unreasonable, the\ncloser a company is to this “fact-based plan,” the greater its chances for\nbusiness and fund-raising success.\n\nBusiness Model Checklist (Figure 6.2)\nPivot or Proceed: Validate the Financial Model\nThis step answers one key question: do all the tests point to a scalable, sizable\nbusiness? And can it happen before the company runs out of money?\nIn this step, you’ll figure out whether you have a potentially thriving\nbusiness, a hobby, or a tax loss.\nAnswering the question doesn’t require pounds of Excel spreadsheets or\n50-item budgets. It relies more on the facts you’ve developed by testing your\noriginal hypotheses with the only people who have the answers, your\ncustomers, and with a short list of numbers, the metrics that matter.\nA mere handful of numbers define the difference\nbetween a scalable, profitable business and a\nfailure.\nA mere handful of numbers define the difference between a scalable,\nprofitable business and a failure. Successful entrepreneurs will be able to\nrecite, adjust, and recompute this handful or so of key numbers about\ncustomers, product costs, and revenue growth while they sleep. Meanwhile,\nthey’re always focused on the two metrics that matter most: how many\nmonths’ worth of cash remain in the bank? And how fast are we burning\nthrough what’s left?\nWe guarantee that this different approach to finance will get you thrown\nout of just about every business school in the country, but it’s all that’s\nneeded at this stage to determine whether your business model passes the\nvalidation test and is ready to move on from validation to scale in customer\ncreation.\nMetrics that Matter\nSince page 1 of this book you’ve been using the business model canvas to\norganize your testing. In this section we’re going to use the canvas to\norganize your financial model. This is a radically different approach\ncompared to more typical use of 5-year revenue forecast spreadsheets. Think\nof it as bringing your “report card” home to Mom and Dad—hopefully, a\nreport card full of A’s and A+’s, since B and C responses do not a great\ncompany make. Some elements of the business model represent revenue or\ncosts, while others fuel growth. Physical and web/mobile channel costs vary\nwidely, as do rates of sale and growth, so one last time we’ll examine the\nmetrics three different ways:\nIn a physical channel, less than a dozen numbers usually tell the entire story:\nValue proposition: What are product cost, market size, attainable market\nshare, and customer impact of network effects?\nCustomer Relationships: What are customer acquisition costs, prospect\nconversion rates, customer lifetime value, and customer switching costs\nthat the company may have to pay?\nMarket Type: As discussed in Chapter 3, different market types drive\ndifferent revenue curves to consider in longer-term revenue predictions\nCost Structure: What are the basic operating costs of the business?\nChannel: What are the costs of selling through the channel?

When will the company run out of cash?\nA Few Words about Burn Rate\nVenture capitalist Fred Wilson suggests some burn-rate guidelines for\nventure funded web/mobile businesses that may be helpful to entrepreneurs\nof all stripes. Wilson’s advice looks at burn rate based on the company’s\ngrowth stage.\nCustomer discovery, which he calls the “building product” stage, should\nkeep the burn rate between $50,000 and $75,000 a month, which should\nfund a team of three or four engineers building the MVP as well as the\nfounding team, rent, operating costs and the like\nCustomer validation, Wilson’s “building usage” stage, shouldn’t exceed\na burn rate of $100,000 a month. This stage begins when product/market\nfit is achieved and fuels the “get customers” and MVP iteration\ndiscussed in this chapter\nCustomer creation, Wilson’s “building the business” stage, should\nideally hold the burn rate to $250,000 a month as the company builds a\nteam, expands marketing activities, and starts generating material\nrevenues\nThese are guidelines, and there are zillions of exceptions.\nAssemble all your test results to provide a forecast for the coming year,\nwhich begins on Day One of Step 3 of Customer Development, the customer\ncreation process.\nWe doubt there have been many startups where the year-one financial\nresults of customer creation matched the “metrics that matter.” But any VC,\nuncle or rich neighbor is going to want to know why you think an investment\nin your startup will deliver startup-size returns. If at the end of this step the\nnumbers are ugly—yup, you guessed it—turn back to the beginning of\ndiscovery, or at least customer validation, and start revising and retesting\nyour hypotheses.\nThree things to consider before you dive into Metrics That Matter:\nUse the time frames that make the most sense for your startup.\nGenerally, the longer the physical-channel sales cycle (think enterprise\nsoftware), the longer the “space” between calculations should be. Here\nwe used a quarter-by-quarter forecast\nAn analysis like this can—and should—often stop the pivot–or-proceed\nprocess in its tracks if the computation forecasts that the company will\neither run out of money within the year or won’t be able to raise enough\nfunds to survive the first year of customer creation\nDon’t be in a hurry at this critical step. As an entrepreneur, if you take a\npile of money to move forward here and fail, it will at least cost you a\nsignificant portion of your founders’ equity, and it will often cost you\nyour job\nMetrics that Matter Scenarios\nMetrics matters are a radically new approach to startup math. They’re best\nillustrated with a series of examples. The three spreadsheet scenarios on the\nnext pages illustrate how you can use “Metrics that Matter” to evaluate your\nbusiness. The three examples are:\na physical product sold in a physical channel\na web/mobile product sold in the web/mobile channel\nand a multisided web/mobile market\nMetrics that Matter: Example 1\n“EZ Gardener” in a Physical Channel\nLet’s take a look at Table 6.1 what the metrics that matter for a physical\nchannel would look like in spreadsheet form.\nHere’s a simple example of a rough quarter-by-quarter cash-burn\ncomputation for our hypothetical $30 (suggested retail) EZ Gardener all-inone gardening-tool set, sold in garden stores and by mass merchants. Our\ntiming is the coming year. (The spreadsheet starts Day One of the customer\ncreation process.)\n“Metrics That Matter”: Physical Channel Model (Table 6.1)\nNote: the leftmost numbers refer to commentary in descriptive text that\nfollows.\nA few things about the hypothetical business factored into the numbers\nabove:\nThis “friends and family” funded venture begins customer creation with\n$500,000 in the bank. Like most physical-channel marketers, EZ\nGardener also promotes online. But they read this book, followed\ndirections, and are “getting the most important channel right first,” so\nthey’re not selling product online yet\nIn year two, as the product’s newness wears off, the price drops.\nProduct development was completed earlier offshore, so there are no\nmore development costs until we see how this product sells\nRevenue never scales dramatically, since the market type is “resegmenting/niche market”\nWhat Metrics Matter?\nThere are 11 metrics that matter in this spreadsheet. Following the left-hand\ncolumn of the spreadsheet, let’s explore the origin of each number as well as\nits source a little more closely:\n1. Total number of units sold: This number is estimated (ideally by\nquarter) from customer validation report cards used with buyers and\nchannel partners. Compare these numbers with your estimates of total\naddressable (or if known, serviceable) market and your market share\nestimates. Use the two sets of numbers to estimate the number of units to\nbe sold in each quarter. If customers make multiple purchases within a\nyear, factor it in.\n2. Average retail selling price: How much the consumer will pay, on\naverage, for the product. This number, developed in the value proposition\nhypothesis, should be validated in the competitive analysis and\nthroughout customer and channel validation conversations. It’s shown\nhere as the price per unit and is often the average selling price, since retail\npricing may vary by channel.\n3. Gross sales across all channels: Total retail-dollar sales for the product\nper quarter. Relatively straightforward to compute, since the company is\nusing only one sales channel. Remember to consider “guaranteed sale”\nsituations where retailers can return unsold merchandise for full credit.\n4. (Less) channel discount (40%): What percentage of the product’s retail\nprice will the channel take as its cost of sales? Deduct it from the retail\nprice and apply it to all channel revenue as computed in No. 3. We’ve\nassumed a fairly typical chain-store margin here. This revenue will never\nreach the company’s coffers, so deduct it now to get to net company\nrevenue.\nChannels are notorious for charging suppliers for\nadvertising, promotion, and shelf space.\n5. (Less) other channel costs: Channels are notorious for charging\nsuppliers for advertising, promotion, and even shelf space. There may\nalso be costs of independent sales reps or brokers who “sell in”\nmerchandise to the channel. In the first year, the company may want to,\nor be forced to, purchase special promotions in order to get shelf space in\nan important retail channel. Estimate these costs based on channel-partner\ndiscussions.\n6. NET COMPANY REVENUE: The net channel revenue (No. 6) is the\nGross Sales (No. 3) minus the channel discount (No. 4) and other channel\ncost (No.5).\n7. (Less) sales costs (reps, trade shows): How much does it cost the team\nto reach the garden product channel cost? In addition to specific customer\nacquisition costs, the company will spend money on a sales force, sales\nand marketing materials, attendance at trade shows and more. These costs\nshould be identified in the customer-relationships box and perhaps also in\nthe cost structure box.\n8. (Less) product costs: What does it cost to build and make the product?\nDeveloped primarily from the value proposition and cost structure boxes,\nthis is an estimate combining two sets of costs:\n• in this example the cost of developing the product is fully paid for\n• the manufacturing cost of the physical product itself\n9. (Less) current operating costs: Compute the costs of “turning on the\nlights” at the company every day, which should be a relatively static\nnumber: meager founder salaries, other payroll, rent, equipment, utilities,\nlegal, and the like. This number usually shifts the least, so worry about it\nless than others. The spreadsheet increases it modestly late in the year and\nin the second year, as is typical.\n10. CASH BURN FOR PERIOD: Did we make or lose money this quarter?\nHow much? Start with the net company revenue (No. 6) and subtract all\nthe costs beneath it, Nos. 7, 8, and 9. The result of that equation is the\n“cash burn,” or the reduction in the company’s bank account each quarter.\nIn the example above, the company is losing money, or “burning cash,”\nuntil the fourth quarter, when customer growth and reduced productdevelopment costs improve the company’s cash flow quite dramatically.\n11. CASH REMAINING: Start by counting the money in the bank on Day\nOne of the quarter. Our hypothetical company began its first year of\ncustomer creation with $500,000 in the bank. Reduce it by the quarter’s\ncash burn to determine how much will be left at quarter’s end.\nIf These Were Your Numbers, What’s a Founder to\nDo?\nThis is a “nice little business,” and while it will make a lovely living for its\nfounders and a nice return for its investors, it’s hardly a scalable business like\nthe many heroes of Silicon Valley. But even though this company is returning\nas much pretax profit in year two as it had in the bank on day one of year one,\nit’s basically going nowhere fast. It’s a one-product company, and the only\nway it got strong revenue growth was by reducing its retail price—never a\ngood sign.\nSome things the founders and board should really be discussing:\nAre there any potential dramatic changes to the business model that can\nhave significant impact on the company’s future growth prospects?\nWhat about overseas markets? Are they a growth opportunity?\nHow can the company capitalize on its one modest success. Are they\nbuilding a brand enough, and creative enough, to perhaps launch other\nproducts both in and beyond the garden area. They might start with\n“EZWeeder” and “EZhoe” first, and perhaps expand to “EZgrass” or\n“EZflowers” to take maximum advantage of their brand, credibility and\nchannel relationships to scale the company broader and faster?\nCan they extend beyond the garden, maybe adding “EZcooker” or\n“EZcleaner” or “EZcleanup” perhaps? Regardless of the new products,\nthe company would need to spend some serious product development\ndollars and spend heavily on marketing (especially if moving beyond the\ngarden) with no assurances of further success. (They actually need to\ndevelop a whole new set of hypotheses)\nUnless the company invests in new product development, this business\nis more of a hobby than a scalable business\nHold these thoughts—and others—for the final section of this phase, the\npivot-or-proceed discussion. Next, look at the second of three business\nmodels for a software product sold in the web and mobile channels.\nMetrics that Matter: Example 2\nExpense Reporter Sold via Web/mobile Channels\nLet’s take a look at Table 6.2, another $30 retail product, downloadable\nXpensePro software, sold through the web/mobile channels only.\n\n“Metrics That Matter”: Web/Mobile Sales Model (Table 6.2)\nNote: the leftmost numbers refer to commentary in descriptive text that\nfollows.\nIn this scenario, our hypothetical company is selling XpensePro only as\na web or mobile app download directly from its website and via app stores.\nAs in the previous example, things are factored into the numbers above:\nProduct-development cost is heavy at first and then declines.\nIncremental product unit costs are practically zero, since the product is a\ndownload\nRevenue never scales dramatically, since the market type is “resegmenting/niche market,” but the year-to-year revenue increases are\nsignificant enough to promise downstream success\nThis angel-funded business starts with $300,000 cash remaining. More\nmoney will be hard to get\nWhat Metrics Matter?\nThere are five metrics that matter in this spreadsheet:\n• Revenue comes from three channels\nDirect revenue from web sales, net of acquisition cost\nDirect mobile sales revenues, after subtracting referral incentives\nRevenue from the appstore channel, after subtracting channel fees\nand marketing costs\n• Cash burned or made during the period\n• Cash remaining at the end of the quarter\nBecause the business is operating in three distinct channels, each of\nwhich operates differently, it takes 17 different numbers to create the above\nfive metrics, but the board just needs to focus on five rather than 17. If one’s\never out of whack or way off budget, drill down into the supporting details\nnumbers that make that number up: unit sales, gross direct revenue, cost of\ncustomers or sales, and net revenue from the channel.\nFollowing the left-hand column of the spreadsheet, let’s explore the origin of\neach number and its source:\nWeb Sales:\n1. Direct web unit sales: How many web apps are downloaded from the\ncompany’s site. Customers are unlikely to make multiple purchases\nwithin a year.\n2. Gross direct revenue: Multiply the number of units (No. 1) by the\naverage selling price of $30.\n3. (Less) customer acquisition cost: The cost to make a sale over the web\nOn average, $6 worth of AdWords, incentives, e-mail and the like to\nacquire one customer. Multiply $6 by the number of solid units (No. 1).\n4. Net web revenue total: Subtract the customer acquisition cost (No. 3)\nfrom the gross direct revenue from website sales (No. 2).\n5. Direct mobile unit sales: A few customers will find and download the\napp’s mobile version at the company website (most will find it at the app\nstores). Calculate the quarterly units using the process described in EZ\nGardner metric #1.\nOn the surface, this looks like a really lovely\nbusiness.\n6. Gross revenue/direct mobile units: Multiply the number of mobile units\nsold directly to customers (No. 5) by $30, the average selling price.\n7. (Less) referral incentive: The customer-relationships hypothesis\nindicates that a third of the company’s direct sales will come from\nreferrals by happy customers encouraged by a $4 incentive. Take 1/3 of\nthe directsales web (No. 1) and mobile (No. 5) units and multiply by $4.\n8. DIRECT mobile revenue total: How much cash winds up in the\ncompany’s bank from this channel? Multiply units (No. 5) by\nrevenue/unit (No. 6) and then subtract the referral incentive (No. 7) to\nfind the answer.\n9. CHANNEL app-store sales (units): Calculate units using the channel\nmethod outlined in EZ Gardner unit sales #3.\n10. CHANNEL gross revenue: multiply the channel units sold (No. 9) by\nthe retail price of $30.\n11. (Less) market/app-store 30% fee: Every download sold will cost the\ncompany an app store fee of 30 percent, or $9. Multiply units (No. 9) by\n$9.00 and subtract it from channel revenue (No. 10).\n12. TOTAL NET APPSTORE revenue: Subtract the app-store fee (No.\n11) from channel revenue (No. 10) to find the amount of cash that will\nwind up in the company’s bank from app-store sales.\n13. TOTAL NET revenue (all channels): Add three revenue numbers—\nNo. 4 (direct web revenue), No. 8 (direct mobile revenue), and No. 12\n(net channel revenue)—to compute the company’s net sales.\n14. (Less) product/product-development costs: What does it cost to build\nand make the product? Compute your ongoing product development\ncosts, plus download and bandwidth charges. There’s no physical cost of\nthe product itself.\n15. (Less) current operating costs: Compute the costs of turning on the\nlights at the company every day, as in Example 1, line 9.\n16. CASH BURN FOR PERIOD: Did we make or lose money this quarter?\nHow much? Follow the process for calculating cash burn outlined in\nSpreadsheet 1, line 10.\n17. CASH REMAINING: Follow the process in Spreadsheet 1, No. 11.\nIf These Were Your Numbers, What’s a Founder to\nDo?\nOn the surface, this looks like a really lovely business. It plans to generate\n$746,000 in positive cash flow in its first year of customer creation, and to\nroughly triple that cashflow in its second year. But can a business doing $2.5-\nmillion in revenue after four years really make investors and founders happy?\nThat’s not for us to decide, and the numbers don’t tell us whether they spent\n$500,000 and a year—or $5,000,000 and five years—to get to the start of the\nspreadsheet, so it’s hard to applaud or bash the outcome.\nSeems like the next board meeting should pull out the latest business\nmodel canvas and look for some game-changing growth opportunities, almost\nno matter what. The company isn’t spending all that much money on product\ndevelopment or staff costs (those numbers are relatively flat), and it’s almost\nturning into a cash cow long before it should be turned out to pasture.\nAfter all, almost any business that can get almost 100,000 new\ncustomers in a year should be trying to figure out how to either add a zero to\nthat number in a year or two, or at least double it, perhaps, in the second year.\nThe company’s year two plan seems unambitious at first glance, even though\nthe profits double.\nMeanwhile, on the downside:\nThe $4 incentive (No. 7) might deliver too few sales and need to be\nbeefed up, changing net revenues adversely\nApp-store (No.12) approval process could delay launch in the biggest\nchannel, hurting revenues\nMore staff (No. 15) might be needed for support, channel relations, or\nwho-knows-what\nMobile sales direct to consumers (No. 5) could be a total flop, hurting\nthat revenue\nEven though the numbers look pretty good in the spreadsheet, hold the\nhigh-fives and look at ways to improve them anyway. After all, they’re still\nestimates based on customer validation proof—they’re not money in the bank\nby any means. Review the “what’s a founder to do” section under\nSpreadsheet 1 to explore ways to reduce the cash burn where it makes sense.\nHold all these thoughts—and others—for the final section of this phase, the\npivot-or-proceed discussion.\n\n“Metrics That Matter”: Multi-sided/Ad-Supported Model (Table 6.3)\nNote: the leftmost numbers refer to commentary in descriptive text that\nfollows.\nMetrics that Matter: Example 3\nA Multi-sided Market Example\nHere’s a third way to look at a totally different business model for the exact\nsame product, XPensePro software. Let’s explore a multi-sided market,\nwhere the product is identical but it’s absolutely free to users. Advertisers\neager to reach businesspeople with active expense accounts will pay to reach\nthe audience, and company revenues come from advertising and sales of email lists, the other “side” in this multi-sided market example.\nA multi-sided market, where the product is\nidentical but it’s absolutely free to users.\nIn this scenario, our venture-backed multi-sided market company is\noffering its products to users for free, provided that they agree to receive two\ne-mails per week from advertisers. The product is a digital download, but\nconsiderable resources are expended selling ads to the other side of the\nmarket. (It’s interesting to note how dissimilar these metrics that matter are\nwhen compared with the other two business models.) As in the previous\nexample, several things are factored into the numbers above:\nOur VC-backed example has a $10-million war chest\nProduct-development cost is heavy at first and then declines\nProduct costs are practically zero, since the “product” is a download.\nRevenue never scales dramatically, since the market type is “resegmenting/niche market,” but the year-to-year revenue increases are\nsignificant enough to promise downstream success\nMuch of the cost of advertising and e-mail sales is factored into the\nrevenue numbers, which are net of network or rep commission costs\nIt still costs real money to acquire users through PR, e-mail, and other\nactivities, even for a free product. As the company iterates and becomes\nsmarter, its acquisition cost declines in the second year\nMetrics that Matter/Add It All Up\nThere are 16 “metrics that matter” in this spreadsheet because we need to\nmonitor revenue and costs on both sides of the multi-sided market. (The\ncompany pivoted and eliminated cash sales of its product in this scenario.)\nFollowing the left-hand column of the spreadsheet, let’s explore the origin of\neach number as well as its source a little more closely:\n1. New activated users : How many people will download the free app and\nbegin actively using it. Active is defined as generating at least the average\nnumber of page views (No. 4).\n2. New user acquisition cost @ $3: On average, the customer acquisition\ncosts to generate one active user (No. 1). Some will come virally for free,\nothers will cost $6 or more.\n3. Total active users: Average active monthly users during the quarter.\n4. Average page views per user per quarter: Actual user clicks on the site\nwill generate this number by dividing the number of active users (No. 3)\ninto total page views (No. 5). This is an important measure of the\nbusiness health and growth.\n5. Total page views per quarter: Multiply the total users (No. 3) by the\naverage page views per user (No. 4) to begin to understand available\nadvertising-sales opportunities for the period.\n6. Less attrition: Lots of users abandon things they download but don’t\nhave to pay for, so watching this number (generated by instrumentation)\nis important. We’ve defined attrition as a user who hasn’t generated a\npage view a week for two consecutive months.\n7. TOTAL CPMs to sell: subtract attrition (No. 6) from total page views\n(No. 5) and divide by 1,000 for the “salable CPMs” needed (ad sales are\nbased on cost per thousand, or CPM). The +/- 7% average gets worse in\nyear two as more competitors emerge.\n8. Average CPM x 4 ads/page: Competitive analysis and “buy-side”\ncustomer validation research will determine what CPM advertisers are\nwilling to pay to reach this audience. Assuming four ads on each page,\nmultiply the average CPM by 4 to compute the average revenue per 1,000\npages viewed. In this example, we’ve already deducted the cost of sales,\nwhether it’s commissions for sales reps or network ad sales. The CPM\nincreases (Q3-4) as the site gets more attractive to advertisers.\n9. TOTAL ADVERTISING REVENUE: multiply the number of M’s (No.\n7) or total CPMs available for sale by the 4x average CPM (No. 8) to\ncompute advertising revenue. The figure grows dramatically as the\nnumber of users and their site traffic rise.\nThe business model looks so strong and\ncompelling...\n10. E-mail-list rental revenue: An estimate based on competitive analysis\nand buy-side customer validation research. This starts out small and at\nvery low rates (per thousand) and, both CPM and volume build as the\naudience becomes large enough to be attractive to advertisers.\n11. TOTAL REVENUE: This ad-supported multi-sided marketer has only\ntwo sources of revenue. Add the advertising revenue (No. 9) to the email-list rental revenue (No. 10).\n12. (Less) user acquisition cost: Subtract the number from Line 2 here.\n13. (Less) product/product-development cost: Computed from customer\nvalidation and cost structure boxes of the business model. While this\ndeclines later in the first year as the initial product matures, the budget\nincreases in the second year to add features that will help the company\ncontinue attracting new customers.\n14. (Less) current operating costs: Compute the costs of turning on the\nlights at the company every day, as the EZ Gardner example, line 9 on\npage 442.\n15. CASH BURN per period: Subtract the three cost centers (Nos. 12, 13\nand 14) from the total revenue (No. 11) to compute the quarterly cash\nburn.\n16. Cash remaining/end of quarter: Subtract the cash burned (or collected)\nduring the quarter from the checkbook balance as of the first day of the\nquarter to calculate the cash remaining at quarter’s end. This number\nbecomes attractive rather quickly in this model.\nIf These Were Your Numbers, What’s a founder to\ndo?\nThere’s an old rule in startups that a spreadsheet is worth 48.5x the paper it’s\nprinted on. But if this spreadsheet set of “metrics that matter,” is anywhere\nclose to accurate, our founders and investors at Expensereporter may indeed\nhave a homerun on their hands.\nIn this case, the business model looks so strong and compelling that the\nfounders have two clear priorities. Job #1 is to play strong defense, and make\ncertain that they deliver on all the key numbers in the plan (which, as you\nrecall, are already turned into immutable facts through two grueling stages of\nCustomer Development). That process starts with a step-by-step revalidation\nof every single number on the page, to be sure there are no mistakes. Next\nstep: a detailed “worst case” analysis.\nAs every business should, the founding team here should expand this\none set of metrics into three: a worst case and a high case, on both sides of\nthe hypothetical set of metrics shown here. And since the business is totally\ndependent on advertising revenue, they should quickly return to their channel\nvalidation efforts and probe further to make sure they’re as valid as everyone\nbelieves. They should also focus on reducing user attrition.\nWith all that accomplished, review the analyses from Spreadsheets 1 and\n2 about reducing costs and optimizing activation and revenue. Then, just in\ncase, put a case of great French Champagne in the office fridge!\nSome Final Thoughts About the Financial Model\nMarket Type Affects Revenue Streams. Each of the four market types has a\ndistinctive sales-growth curve shaped by the degree of difficulty involved in\ntransitioning from sales to the earlyvangelists to sales to mainstream\ncustomers. Obviously in new markets, it typically takes considerable time for\nthe product to catch on beyond earlyvangelists, who aren’t typically highvolume mainstream buyers. So success with early sales doesn’t guarantee fast\nrevenue scaling.\nThe sales-growth curves for a new market and an existing market\ngraphically illustrate the difference. Even after finding and successfully\nselling to earlyvangelists, the rate of sales differs in later years because of the\ndifferent adoption rates of mainstream customers.\nRevenue Growth in New and Existing Markets (Figure 6.3)\nEstimating revenue in an existing market is relatively simple: Look at\nthe incumbents and calculate the increasing percentage of market share the\nstartup will grab each year.\nEstimating a new market’s size might seem impossible, since it doesn’t\nexist yet. What to do? Estimate the opportunity based on proxies and adjacent\nmarkets. See if there are any comparable companies. Have others grown as\nfast as the estimate? Why will this startup perform similarly?\nRevenue Growth in a Resegmented Market (Figure 6.4)\nThe sales curve in a re-segmented market is somewhat easier to\nestimate. It’s generally similar to that of a new market in that it takes time to\ngather a head of steam. There are three steps to assessing a re-segmented\nmarket: assess the size of the existing market, figure out how large your\nstartup’s “segment” is, and calculate the adoption rate, or the time it will take\nfor that segment to recognize the new product as the solution of choice.\nCount only the segment that will switch, and beware of long-term contracts,\nservice contracts, and “sunk costs” such as training and installation, all of\nwhich are often “lock-ins” or hidden barriers to switching.\nRevenue growth curves depend on Market Type!\nDemand Curve Affects Revenue: The “demand curve” seeks the optimum\nintersection between sales volume and net profit. For example, if a physical\nproduct is most efficiently manufactured in lot sizes of 5,000, can that\ninventory be sold in a reasonable time when current unit sales are 50 a\nmonth? A startup selling new electric cars for $29,000 will generate massive\ndemand. But if they cost $45,000 to manufacture, the company will go\nbankrupt very quickly. Consider:\nthe actual price per unit, for multiples, and for subscriptions\nhow pricing can be used to attract more users\nhow pricing can create larger or more frequent purchases by the same\nuser; volume discounts, free shipping, loyalty points and similar pricing\nmechanisms are used for what’s typically called “market basket”\noptimization\nhow pricing can be used to enhance profitability or volume\nhow the company can forward-price the product to intersect the\neconomies-of-scale curve (as in, “If we could build 10,000 at a time, our\nproduction cost drops 32 percent”)\nWhen to Bring in the Accountants\nEventually, prospective investors, banks, and others will want to see the\ntraditional P&L, forecast, and more, and that’s fine. Once the metrics that\nmatter are firmly understood to make sound business sense and are validated,\nalmost any finance type (or high school math student) can convert them into a\nVC-ready multiyear P&L spreadsheet, balance sheet, and cash-flow statement\n(the “usual stuff” everyone is accustomed to seeing) with ease.\nOn rare and welcome occasions, metrics that matter actually don’t\nmatter at all. If customer acquisition and activation are proceeding at warp\nspeed month after month or the economy is hot, investors may ignore most of\nthe other metrics, throw caution to the wind, and vote to scale the company\nrapidly. This seldom happens, but we hope it happens to you. It can happen\nmore often in frothy vertical markets, as it did in social networking and other\nmulti-sided markets or strong IPO markets,. But nine times out of 10, the\nmetrics that matter do matter quite a bit when it comes time to spend serious\ninvestor dollars.\nAdding it all up\nThis phase is a vital make-or-break analysis of how well the business model\nshould work. But remember that the numbers are still only educated guesses,\nvalidated—we hope—through extensive customer discovery and validation\neffort with scores if not hundreds of customers.\nPivot or Proceed: Re-Validate the Business Model\nIt’s the perfect time to take one last look at the key business model\ncomponents, for several reasons. In a few days, a great deal will change if the\nvote is “go forward” to the customer creation step. Customer creation is a\nradically different stage during which the company suddenly shifts from\n“searching for a business model” to “executing one.” It’s no longer\ncelebrating mistakes and wrong turns. It shifts full-throttle into “execute”\nmode, with revenue targets and timetables to hit, product and plans to deliver,\nand more granular and precise accountability to investors and board\nmembers.\nThe company is about to spend a great deal of money far faster, and\nirrevocably, as it works ambitiously to deliver its chosen business model.\nWith that comes the typical “career risk” for founders, which always prompts\ninvestors to ask if the seemingly manic “founder type” should be replaced by\na “seasoned” leader with proven execution skills. Massive amounts of money\nare about to be spent on a single, focused bet that the business model, as\ndeveloped, has a high likelihood of scaling to profit and success. Boards and\ninvestors are suddenly less forgiving and typically far less welcoming of\nreports like “That idea was wrong” and “That didn’t work as we hoped” than\nthey were during the earlier “search” phases.\nLong story short, it’s time to revisit the core business model elements\none last time.\nBest Bets\nYou’re almost done. You’ve run the numbers in the last section and are still\nfeeling like your business is a winner. But have you picked the best value\nproposition? Is your product delivery schedule right? Are you confident\nyou’ve gotten the optimum revenue model and costs? And have you missed\nany best moves on the overall business model? Here are a few last things to\ncheck.\nMake Sure the Value Proposition is Right\nAfter going through the “metrics that matter” in the last section, are you\nabsolutely convinced you have the right value proposition? You’re about to\nlive with it for awhile. If you don’t feel that it’s going to win the marketplace\nnow, it doesn’t get better over time. It may be time to reconfigure, repackage\nor unbundle the product. This requires a loop all the way back to customer\ndiscovery. Once there, use the core technology to develop another product,\nconfiguration, distribution method or price and then modify product\npresentations and return to Phase 3 (product presentation) and do it again.\nYes, it hurts, but it hurts far less than failure.\nMake Sure the Product Delivery is Right\nEven with selling success, check the product delivery timing with the\nproduct-development team. Schedules inevitably change, seldom for the\nbetter. Can the company still deliver what was just sold and do so as\npromised, or was the sale actually vaporware? If vaporware, at best the\ncompany secured a few pilot projects. Continuing to sell as if nothing has\nchanged is a bad idea. As schedules slip, hard-won earlyvangelists weaken,\nand references evaporate quickly. The good news is, if this happens (it\nhappens often), the situation is still recoverable. There aren’t many people to\nfire, and the burn rate is low. (As discussed earlier, it’s always important to\nhave enough cash to get this phase wrong at least once.) The solution is to\nshut down any additional selling for a while, admit mistakes, and turn pilot\nprojects into something useful—first for the customer and then as a\nmarketable product.\nMake Sure the Revenue is High and Costs are Low\nThere’s nothing worse than leaving money on the table or spending more\nthan you needed to. The best way to answer these questions and more is to\n“walk” slowly through the business model one more time.\nStart with the value proposition. Are there too many features or not\nenough variety? Would a lower price sell far more units or sell the same\nnumber at a lower acquisition cost? What if the product were free, or\nfree to those bringing three or five or 10 other customers along?\nIn the customer-relationships hypothesis, is there rock-solid confidence\nin the plan, or might a freemium or multi-sided alternative deliver\nbolder, faster growth? Will that costly AdWords effort deliver the\nplanned result?\nCan a different channel deliver fewer sales and more profit?\nWill partners deliver the revenue growth you need and expect?\nAre there higher level business model patterns you may have missed?\nMake Sure Your Business Model is Right\nGrab a fresh business model canvas and a pack of Post-it notes. Explore\nalternatives seriously. The team is about to put a big pile of chips, probably\nmillions, on “red” or “black,” as in “pass” or “fail.” Is everyone confident the\nchoice is the right?\nChanging direction at this juncture is a bold move indeed. It’s not what\nthe investors expected, especially after a long, grueling process of customer\ndiscovery and validation. Then again, bold moves are the work of great\nentrepreneurs. And even though a pivot at this point leads to more customer\nvalidation and more time, it’s far better to pivot now than to forge ahead at\nfull speed and full spend if it’s possible that there’s a better idea out there\nsomewhere.\nFurther validate the business model, not just looking for enhancements\nin revenue opportunity and places to reduce cost, but looking for “game\nchangers.” Can you change a product sold by features into a brandedexperience that becomes a “got-to-have-it” fashion? Can you change a\nrevenue model from a unit sale into a network effects model? Look for the\nnon-obvious business patterns. Even if the team is certain the current model\nis the best way forward, now’s the time to bring in your advisory board and\nhave them throw stones (painful as it is) at your canvas. Do they see a huge\nmove that you missed? No doubt the financial model review just completed\nraised at least a handful of questions and perhaps pointed to some\nopportunities. Revisit the business model checklist questions. Are any of the\nanswers different? Does the team want to have more money in the bank or\nspend less? Where can savings be effected or additional dollars efficiently put\nto good?\nIf the team has turned over every possibility in its review, looking both\nat radical changes and modest improvements in the business model, and\nconfidence still carries the day, it’s time to move on to the ultimate question:\npivot or proceed?\nThe Toughest Startup Question: Pivot or Proceed?\nThis is the moment of truth when the team and the investors will vote on\nwhether to begin spending massive amounts of money to execute the business\nmodel. To vote honestly, the team needs to take a hard, honest look at the\npivot-or-proceed analyses developed in this phase.\nAs grueling as the customer validation process is, it’s quite likely that\nthe company will require another turn of the wheel before everyone can\nenthusiastically vote to move forward. Don’t despair—this need to pivot\narises almost every time, and often calls for a return all the way to customer\ndiscovery.\nHubris is the evil twin of a passionate entrepreneur.\nThe alternative is even more painful. In the past, investors magically\nassumed flawless execution and fired executives who failed. It’s time to\nreflect, thinking seriously about the company’s genuine chances for scalable,\nprofitable success. It’s a hard decision, particularly for self-confident\nentrepreneurs who pride themselves on their tenacity, and problem-solving\nabilities. “I’m an entrepreneur. I make things happen against all odds” just\ndoesn’t cut it when staring at the hard facts and statistics. Don’t confuse\nhubris with passion or facts.\nDid validation really convert opinions to facts, or is everyone just\nmoving the goalposts to reach customer creation? The next step seriously\ncranks up the company’s cash burn rate, sharply diminishing if not\nextinguishing available cash or runway.\nDid the product sell well and easily? Is it absolutely, unequivocally clear\nthat when more money is spent to acquire customers, they’ll arrive at a\nsteady, predictable, profitable pace? This question in particular probably\nsends 90 percent of startups back into the depths of Customer Development\nto refine and retest components of the business model.\nIf the “ramp” to more customers, revenue and profits isn’t proved to be\npredictable in test results, it’s also a reason to pivot. Using everything you\nlearned in customer validation, go back to Phase 1 of this step (get ready to\nsell) and try it again. Sorry. This isn’t easy to do.\nIf everything checks out (again, it seldom does the first time around), the\nend of customer validation is a major milestone. Customer problems are\nunderstood, a set of earlyvangelists has been found, and the company has\ndelivered a product its customers want to buy, developed a repeatable and\nscalable sales process, and demonstrated a profitable business model.\nHopefully, all the learning is captured in writing and the business model\ndiagram is updated. Fund-raising, while never easy, will be far easier than at\nthis point than it was before.\nWhen you’ve answered “yes” to that taxing list of questions, you\ndeserve a night off, if not a week. Congratulations! The company is prepared\nto move full speed ahead to the customer creation process.\nWhat’s Next?\nThe first two steps of Customer Development are where entrepreneurs live or\ndie in the search for a repeatable and scalable business model. When a\ncompany has successfully exited Customer Validation, there’s a library full\nof business-building texts available to help execute the business model. So, at\nleast for now, if you’re eager to execute the next two steps—Customer\nCreation and Company Building—return to the original Four Steps to the\nEpiphany, or turn to a more targeted text for fine-tuned support.\nWhatever you do next, the successful completion of Customer\nValidation is a momentous step in the life of your startup. You have\ncompleted an arduous, challenging journey. Our warmest, most sincere\ncongratulations.

This book is a stepby-step how-to guide that details a process for building a successful,\nprofitable, scalable startup. It has more in common with a car repair manual\nthan it does with your favorite page-turner. Don’t attempt to read this book in\na single sitting or long weekend. It will be your companion—and, we hope,\nyour very best friend—for the six to 30 months or more that it often takes to\nbegin building a successful, scalable startup business.\nOrganization\nThis book is organized in four distinct sections. The first, Getting Started,\nfeatures the “Customer Development Manifesto,” a series of 14 guiding\nprinciples for startups deploying the Customer Development process.\nDon’t read too much at a time.\nThe next section, Step One, “Customer Discovery,” turns the founders’\nvision into a business model canvas and then into a series of hypotheses.\nThose hypotheses are turned into experiments, and tested with customers to\nsee if your understanding of the customer problem and proposed solution\nmesh.\nStep Two, “Customer Validation,” expands the scope of the business\nmodel testing to see if you can get enough orders or users to prove that you\nhave a repeatable and scalable business model.\nInterspersed throughout is a series of Checklists that help you track your\nprogress at every stage of the Customer Development process. Use the\nchecklists at the end of each step (yes, there’s one for each) to make sure you\nhave completed all the key tasks outlined in that step. Download them, share\nthem, and circulate them to team members. But most important, use them to\nbe sure you have completed each step—before you move on to the next.\nPaths Through This Book\n• Read the glossary first. Customer Development has a language all its\nown.\n• Before you dive into the details, read the Customer Development\nManifesto.\n• If you are familiar with Customer Development, skim Chapters 1-2,\nstart with Chapter 3, “the business model hypotheses.”\n• If you want to align co-founders, initial employees, investors and\nadvisors around the Customer Development philosophy, have them\nread The Startup Owner’s Manual Strategy Edition.\n• If you want a high-speed overview and little more, there are two\napproaches:\n(a) skim the checklists at the end of each step, which will give you a\nsense of all the tasks you must complete to implement Customer\nDevelopment; or\n(b) flip through the book, looking for “jumbo quotes” like this:\nThis book is not a novel... It’s a reference manual.\nThese quotes highlight the 100 or so “big ideas” found throughout the\nbook and offer a “CliffsNotes” or “Twitter” sense of the text.\n• If you want a detailed checklist of the things founders need to get right,\nstart with Chapter 3, “the business model hypothesis,” and use the\nchecklists in at the end of each step.\n• If your startup is well under way, you might want to start at Chapter 6,\n“Pivot or Proceed,” to gauge your progress. Then you can jump to\nChapter 11, “Metrics that Matter,” to see if you’re ready to scale.\n• To develop and test a web/mobile minimum viable product (MVP),\nread: Design Tests, Build Your Low Fidelity MVP, Low Fidelity\nMVP Problem Test, and Optimize Getting More Customers.\n• To focus on web/mobile marketing (how to “get,” “keep” and “grow”\ncustomers), read:\nHypotheses: Customer Source/Wiring, Channels, and Customer\nRelationships.\nBuild Your Low Fidelity MVP, Low Fidelity MVP Problem Test,\nTraffic/Competitive Analysis, High Fidelity MVP Test, and\nMeasure Customer Behavior.\nGet Ready to Sell: Craft Positioning Statement, Acquire/ Activate\nCustomers Plan, Create a High Fidelity MVP, Build a Metrics\nTool Set, and Hire a Data Analytics Chief.\nGet Out of the Building: Prepare Optimization Plans/Tools,\nOptimize Getting More Customers, Optimize “Keep” and\n“Grow”), Test Sell Traffic Partners.\n• Educators who want to teach Customer Development or the experiential\nLean LaunchPad class should read:\nOur website, www.steveblank.com, with links to our syllabi used at\nStanford, Berkeley and the National Science Foundation.\nBefore the class meets, have the students read:\n— The Customer Development Manifesto in Chapter 1\n— An Introduction to Customer Discovery in Chapter 2\nEach week’s lectures are organized around each of the individual\nhypotheses in Phase 1.\nFor the Lean LaunchPad class, have students read:\n— Get Out of the Building and Test the Problem in Chapter 4.\n— Get Out of the Building and Test the Product Solution in\nChapter 5.\nAll classes should read:\n— Pivot or Proceed, in Chapter 6.\n— Metrics that Matter, in Chapter 11.\nA Few Helpful Tips\nUSE the book, don’t just read it!\nUse the checklists. There is one for every step.\nDon’t read too much at a time. This is a reference manual. It’s\nexhausting when read as a book.\nScan ahead. It gives you context for what you are currently doing. If\nyou’re starting work on Chapter 3, for example, quickly scan Chapter 4 first\nso you understand how what you’re doing now supports what comes next.\nFor a helpful online tool to monitor your team’s progress in the\nCustomer Development process visit\nhttp://www.zoomstra.com/foundersworkbook/.\nEntrepreneurship is not a cookbook or a checklist. At the end of the day,\nfounders are artists. Don’t expect everything to work like the book. It’s\nimpossible for this book to address every entrepreneurial decision and every\ntype of startup. You’re outside the building not only looking for facts, but for\ninsight and inspiration. Not every piece of advice fits every situation you’ll\nencounter. And not every piece of advice will always work. That’s what\nentrepreneurs are for.\nI\nGetting Started\nChapter 1:\nThe Customer Development Manifesto\nCHAPTER 1\nThe Customer Development\nManifesto\nBEFORE DIVING HEADFIRST INTO THE DETAILS of the Customer Development\nprocess, it’s crucial to review the 14 rules that make up The Customer\nDevelopment Manifesto. Embrace them. Review them regularly with the team\nand (maybe after the IPO) consider perhaps even etching them in marble at\nworld headquarters.\nRule No. 1:\nThere Are No Facts Inside Your Building, So Get\nOutside.\nOn Day One, the startup is a faith-based enterprise built on its founders’\nvision and a notable absence of facts. The founders’ job is to translate this\nvision and these hypotheses into facts. Facts live outside the building, where\nfuture customers (prospects, really) live and work, so that’s where you need\nto go. Nothing is more fundamental to Customer Development, and nothing\nis harder to do. It’s much easier to write code, build hardware, have meetings\nand write reports than it is to find and listen to potential customers. But that’s\nwhat separates the winners from the losers.\nFacts live outside the building, where future\ncustomers live and work...\nIn Customer Development, the founders gather firsthand experience\nabout every component of the business model. The team can support the\nfounders, but firsthand experience by definition cannot be delegated. This\ncustomer research must be done by founders because:\nKey customer feedback points are random, unpredictable, and often\npainful to hear. Employees hate to deliver bad news to higher-ups\nEmployees have far less at stake and seldom listen as acutely, and they\ndon’t get heard adequately when they report back. It’s too easy to\ndismiss their findings as “hearsay” or to ignore critical points of\nfeedback\nConsultants have even less at stake than employees and often color their\ncommentary to either tell the client what he wants to hear or deliver\nmessages that can lead to extended consulting relationships. This is also\nsecond- or third-hand feedback and too diluted or diffused to provide\nvalue\nOnly a founder can embrace the feedback, react to it, and adeptly make\nthe decisions necessary to change or pivot key business model components.\nRule No. 2:\nPair Customer Development with Agile\nDevelopment\nCustomer Development is useless unless the product\ndevelopment organization can iterate the product\nwith speed and agility.\nCustomer Development is useless unless the product development\norganization can iterate the product with speed and agility. If Engineering\nbuilds the product using waterfall development, it will be deaf, dumb and\nblind to customer input except during a short period when it’s specifying the\nproduct. The rest of the time, engineers are locked into an implementation\ncycle, unable to change the product features without intolerable delay. By\ncontrast, a startup engineering organization using an agile methodology is\ndesigned to continually take customer input and deliver a product that iterates\nreadily around an MVP or its minimum feature set.\nIn this book, agile engineering/development refers to the rapid\ndeployment, iterative development and continuous discovery processes that\nhardware or software companies can use. We don’t advocate any particular\nflavor, just its necessity. The Customer Development process provides the\ncontinuous customer input to make agile work.\nBefore the company even starts, the founders need to reach a deep and\ninexorable commitment to the customer/agile development partnership.\nRule No. 3:\nFailure is an Integral Part of the Search\nOne of the key differences between a startup and an existing company is the\none that’s never explicitly stated: “startups go from failure to failure.”\nIn contrast, existing companies have learned what works and doesn’t.\nFailures in an existing company are an exception. They happen when\nsomeone screws up. In a startup, you’re searching, not executing, and the\nonly way to find the right path is to try lots of experiments and take a lot of\nwrong turns. Failure is part of the process.\nIf you’re afraid to fail in a startup, you’re destined\nto do so.\nFailures are not truly failures, per se but an integral part of the startup\nlearning process. You’ll be running dozens if not hundreds of pass/fail tests\n—on your pitch, your features, your pricing, and on and on—so get ready to\naccept failure and move on. When something isn’t working, successful\nfounders orient themselves to the new facts, decide what needs fixing, and act\ndecisively.\nThe Customer Development process demands frequent, agile iteration,\nfollowed, of course, by testing of the iteration that often leads to another\niteration or pivot, which leads to more testing and...\nIf you’re afraid to fail in a startup, you’re destined to do so.\nRule No. 4:\nMake Continuous Iterations and Pivots\nThe strategy of embracing failure in Customer Development demands\nfrequent, agile iteration and pivots. A pivot is a substantive change in one or\nmore of the nine boxes of the business model canvas. (For example, a pricing\nchange from freemium to subscription model or a customer segment shift\nfrom boys 12-15 years old to women 45-60.) Or it can be more complex,\nsuch as a change of target customer or user. Iterations, meanwhile, are minor\nchanges to business model components (e.g., changing pricing from $99 to\n$79).\nGroupon’s legendary $12 billion pivot is a perfect\nexample.\nWhen a company is limping along, only a dramatic change to one or\nmore business model components can get it back on the road to success.\nGroupon’s legendary $12 billion pivot (their IPO valuation) is a perfect\nexample. Groupon was started from a company called the Point. It was\nstruggling, at best, as a social media platform working to get people together\nto solve problems, but was about to run out of money.\nThe most effective campaigns on The Point were those that saved people\nmoney by grouping or bundling their purchases. The founders started\nblogging various deals from different businesses each day. They called this,\n“Get Your Groupon.com.” Groupon’s first offer hit in October of 2008: buy\ntwo pizzas for the price of one in the shop on the first floor of its Chicago\nheadquarters. Twenty people bought the deal and the company was well on\nits way to its $12-billion pivot.\nPivots are driven by the learnings and insight from a continuous stream\nof “pass/fail” tests you run throughout discovery and validation.\nThe best startup founders don’t hesitate to make the change. They admit\nwhen hypotheses are wrong and adapt.\nRule No. 5:\nNo Business Plan Survives First Contact with\nCustomers So Use a Business Model Canvas\nThere’s only one reason for a business plan: some investor who went to\nbusiness school doesn’t know any better and wants to see one. But once it has\ndelivered financing, the business plan is fundamentally useless.\nEntrepreneurs often mistake their business plan as a cookbook for execution,\nfailing to recognize that it is only a collection of unproven assumptions. At its\nback, a revenue plan blessed by an investor, and composed overwhelmingly\nof guesses, suddenly becomes an operating plan driving hiring, firing, and\nspending. Insanity.\nThe difference between a static business plan and a\ndynamic model could well be the difference between\nflameout and success.\nThe difference between a static business plan and a dynamic business\nmodel could well be the difference between a flameout and success. Startups\nshould dump the business plan and adopt the flexible business model.\nA business model describes the flow between key components of the\ncompany:\nvalue proposition, which the company offers (product/service, benefits)\ncustomer segments, such as users, and payers, or moms or teens\ndistribution channels to reach customers and offer them the value\nproposition\ncustomer relationships to create demand\nrevenue streams generated by the value proposition(s)\nresources needed to make the business model possible\nactivities necessary to implement the business model\npartners who participate in the business and their motivations for doing\nso\ncost structure resulting from the business model\nThe business model canvas (see Figure 1.1) presents a visual overview\nof the nine components of a business on one page. In this book, Alexander\nOsterwalder’s business model canvas serves as the scorecard for the customer\ndiscovery process described in Step One. Osterwalder’s book Business Model\nGeneration (Wiley, 2010) provides the structure for the canvas.\nBusiness Model Canvas (Figure 1.1)\nAs a startup moves through the Customer Development process, it will\nuse the business model canvas as a scorecard, by posting the hypotheses\nabout each component of the model and then revising the hypotheses as the\nfounders gather facts. Think of your first version of the business model\ncanvas as the starting point showing the hypotheses that must be confirmed in\nface-to-face or online interaction with customers. More often than not, the\ncustomers will reject components of the business model, saying, “I’d rather\nbuy that from a retailer,” or, “The product needs to have these features to be\nimportant to me.” As customers approve or dispute the business model\nhypotheses, the company either accepts the customers’ approval or pivots to\nchange its business model to better target the opportunity.\nUsing the business model canvas as a guide makes it easier to figure out\nwhere and how to pivot, since the team can visually diagram its alternatives\nand see what it needs to change. Each time the founders iterate or pivot (see\nRule No. 4) in response to customer feedback, they draw a new canvas\nshowing the changes. Over time, these multiple canvases form a “flip book”\nthat shows the evolution of the business model. Agile startups can end up\nwith a six-inch-thick stack of business model diagrams they can burn at the\nIPO-celebration bonfire.\nMuch more about how to use business model diagrams to “keep score”\nthroughout the customer discovery process can be found in Chapter 2.\n...hypothesis is just a fancy word for “guess.”\nRule No. 6:\nDesign Experiments and Test to Validate Your\nHypotheses\nInitially, hypothesis is just a fancy word for “guess.” To turn hypotheses into\nfacts, founders need to get out of the building and test them in front of\ncustomers. But how do you test? And what do you want to learn from the\ntests? Testing and learning require you to be thoughtful on constructing and\ndesigning your tests. We call this “designing the experiments.”\nCustomer Development experiments are short, simple, objective\npass/fail tests. You’re looking for a strong signal in the signal/noise noise\nratio, something like five of the first 12 customers you call on saying “I need\nthis right now, even if it’s still buggy.” Early tests aren’t necessarily precise,\nbut should give you a “good enough” signal to proceed.\nThe Customer Development Insight Cycle (Figure 1.2)\nStart by asking yourself, “What insight do I need to move forward?”\nThen ask, “What’s the simplest test I can run to get it?” Finally, think about,\n“How do I design an experiment to run this simple test?”\nOne of the things that trips up engineering founders is thinking that\nthese tests have to be actual code, hardware or the real product. Most of the\ntime you can mock-up the web page or create a demo or physical prototype to\nelicit valuable learning.\nRule No. 7:\nAgree on Market Type. It Changes Everything\nOne of the radical insights guiding this book is that not all startups are alike.\nOne of the key ways in which they are different is in the relationship between\na startup’s new product and its market. These product/market relationships\ngenerally fit one of these descriptions:\nbringing a new product into an existing market\nbringing a new product into a new market\nbringing a new product into an existing market and trying to:\nre-segment that market as a low-cost entrant or\nre-segment that market as a niche entrant\ncloning a business model that’s successful in another country\nWhat confused entrepreneurs for decades is that the traditional product\nintroduction model works when introducing a product into an existing market\nwith a known business model (i.e., known customers, channels and markets).\nHowever, since the majority of startups are not pursuing known markets\n(those in new or re-segmented categories), they don’t really know who their\ncustomers will be. These types of startups are searching for a repeatable and\nscalable business model.\nMarket type influences everything a company does.\nMarket type influences everything a company does. Strategy and tactics\nthat work for one market type seldom work for another. Market type\ndetermines the startup’s customer feedback and acquisition activities and\nspending. It changes customer needs, adoption rates, product features and\npositioning as well as its launch strategies, channels and activities. In sum,\ndifferent market types require dramatically different discovery, MVPs, and\nsales and marketing strategies.\nIn existing markets, where customers exist, marketing is relatively easy:\nusers can describe the market and the attributes that matter the most to them.\nThe new product or service typically runs faster, does something better or\ncheaper, or otherwise improves on a customer-defined attribute. Users, the\nmarket, and competitors are known, and competition involves comparing the\nproduct and its features with others.\nIn a new market, a company lets customers do something they couldn’t do\nbefore by creating something that never existed before. Or it dramatically\nlowers costs to create a new class of users. By definition, new markets have\nno customers yet, so there’s nobody to know what the product can do or why\nthey should buy. This makes getting feedback and creating demand\nparticularly challenging, since the product is unknown to users and the\nmarket is undefined and unknown, and costly to develop.\nThe key isn’t competing, but instead understanding whether a large\ncustomer base exists and whether customers can be persuaded to buy. A\nclassic founder error in a new market is the “fast-burn” spending of sales and\nmarketing funds, a practice that may be appropriate when selling to existing\ncustomers in a known market, but makes no sense in a new market. The newvs.-existing axis is at the core of the market-type definition.\nRe-segmenting an existing market is useful when the incumbent is too\ndifficult to attack head-on (like Amazon, Facebook, or Microsoft). A resegmentation strategy is based on the startup’s market and customer\nknowledge, ideally identifying a market opportunity that incumbents are\nmissing, which usually takes one of two forms: a low-cost strategy or a niche\nstrategy. (Unlike differentiation, segmentation forges a distinct spot in\ncustomers’ minds that is unique, valuable, and in demand.)\nLow-cost re-segmentation is just what it sounds like. Are there\ncustomers at the low end of an existing market who will buy “good enough”\nperformance at a substantially lower price?\nNiche re-segmentation looks at an existing market and asks whether\nsome segment of this market would buy a new product designed to address\nmore specific needs. Can some sizable portion of the market be convinced\nthat a characteristic of the new product is radical enough to change the rules\nand shape of an existing market. See Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne’s\nwork on “Blue Ocean Strategy” for another way to think of re-segmenting a\nmarket.\nCloning an existing business model is a powerful technique when an\nexisting business has been proven in one country but has not yet been\nintroduced in another. Startups in Russia, India, Indonesia, Brazil, Japan and\nChina (each with its own large local market and language and cultural\nbarriers) can adopt, borrow, or copy a successful American business model\nand customize it for local language and buying preferences. (Soon ideas from\nthose countries will be cloned in the U.S.)\nFor example, Baidu in China and Yandex in Russia are the equivalent of\nGoogle in their respective markets. And Qzone, RenRen, PengYou and\nKaixin are the Facebooks of China, while Vkontakte and Odnoklassniki play\nthe same role in Russia.\nStartup companies generally enter one of these four market types and\nultimately must commit to one. The consequences of a wrong market-type\nchoice will prove to be severe in the customer creation stage. While market\ntype is ultimately a “late-binding decision,” a working hypothesis helps frame\nearly customer discovery issues. Market-type decision-making is explored in\ngreater detail in Chapter 2.\n...the few financial metrics to track: cash-burn rate,\nnumber of months’ worth of cash left...\nRule No. 8:\nStartup Metrics Differ from Those in Existing\nCompanies\nWe now have several centuries’ worth of performance metrics for existing\nbusinesses—P&Ls balance sheets, cash-flow forecasts and line-of-business\nanalyses, plus scores of others. Here’s hoping your startup becomes big\nenough to need them someday. In the past (not so long ago), we used these\ntools with startups because we didn’t know what else to measure. We now\nknow that startup metrics should focus on tracking the startup’s progress\nconverting guesses and hypotheses into incontrovertible facts rather than\nmeasuring the execution of a static plan. It’s critical that board and\nmanagement continuously test and measure each hypothesis until the entire\nbusiness model is worth scaling into a company.\nIf the company is venture-backed, management and investors must agree\non a set of metrics that truly matter and work toward a report or “dashboard”\nthat essentially replaces the P&L, cash flow, and balance sheet as\ncenterpieces of early board meetings.\nStartup metrics track the results of pass/fail tests and the iterations they lead\nto:\nHave the customer problem and product features been validated?\nDoes the minimum feature set resonate with customers?\nWho in fact is the customer, and have initial customer-related\nhypotheses on the likes of value proposition, customer segments, and\nchannels been validated through face-to-face customer interaction?\nCustomer-validation questions might include: average order size,\ncustomer lifetime value, average time to first order, rate of sales pipeline\ngrowth, improvement in close rate, and revenue per salesperson.\nIn addition to the startup metrics above, the relatively few financial\nmetrics that a startup board should be tracking are cash-burn rate, number of\nmonths’ worth of cash left, short-term hiring plans, and amount of time until\nthe company reaches cash-flow break-even.\nMake sure decisions are fact-based, not faith-based.\nRule No. 9:\nFast Decision-Making, Cycle Time, Speed and\nTempo\nSpeed matters at startups where the only absolute certainty is that the bank\nbalance declines every day. While Rule No. 4 addresses iterations and pivots,\nit doesn’t specify how long they should take. Unequivocally, the faster the\nbetter, since the faster these “learn, build, pivot” or “iterate, build” cycles\nhappen, the greater the odds of finding a scalable business model with the\ncash on hand. If cycles happen too slowly, the startup runs out of cash and\ndies. The biggest impediment to cycle time is psychological: it requires the\nadmission of being wrong or even of suffering a short-term tactical defeat.\nWhile pivots and iterations are about speed outside the building, speed\nalso matters inside the company. Most startup decisions are made in the face\nof uncertainty. There’s seldom a clear-cut, perfect solution to any\nengineering, customer or competitor problem, and founders shouldn’t\nagonize over trying to find one. This doesn’t mean gambling with the\ncompany’s fortunes on a whim. It means adopting plans with an acceptable\ndegree of risk and doing so quickly. (Make sure these decisions are factbased, not faith-based.) In general, the company that consistently makes and\nimplements decisions rapidly gains a tremendous, often-decisive competitive\nadvantage.\n...startups should make reversible decisions before\nanyone leaves the CEO’s office.\nStartup decisions have two states: reversible and irreversible. A\nreversible decision could be adding or dropping a product feature or a new\nalgorithm in the code or targeting a specific set of customers. If the decision\nproves a bad one, it can be unwound in a reasonable period of time. An\nirreversible decision such as firing an employee, launching a product, or\nsigning a long lease on expensive office space is usually difficult or\nimpossible to reverse.\nStartups should as policy, make reversible decisions before anyone\nleaves the CEO’s office or before a meeting ends. Perfect decision-making is\nboth unimportant and impossible, and what matters more is forward\nmomentum and a tight, fact-based feedback loop to quickly recognize and\nreverse bad decisions. By the time a big company gets the committee to get\nthe subcommittee to pick a meeting date, most startups have made 20\ndecisions, reversed five, and implemented the other 15.\nLearning to make decisions quickly is just part of the equation. Agile\nstartups have mastered another trick: tempo—the ability to make quick\ndecisions consistently and at all levels in the company. Speed and tempo are\nintegral parts of startup DNA, and a great startup’s tempo is often 10 times\nthat of a large company.\nRule No. 10:\nIt’s All About Passion\nA startup without driven, passionate people is dead the day it opens its doors.\n“Startup people” are different. They think different. In contrast, most people\nare great at execution. They work to live, do their jobs well, and enjoy their\nfamily, their lives, their hobbies and often even enjoy mowing the lawn.\nThey’re terrific at executing fixed tasks, and it’s a wonderful life for almost\neveryone.\nThe people leading almost every successful startup in history are just\ndifferent. They’re a very tiny percentage of the world population, and their\nbrains are wired for chaos, uncertainty, and blinding speed. They’re\nirrationally focused on customer needs and delivering great products. Their\njob is their life. It’s not 9-to-5, it’s 24/7. These are the people who found\nhigh-growth, highly-successful scalable startups.\nStartups demand execs who are comfortable with\nuncertainty, chaos and change.\nRule No. 11:\nStartup Job Titles Are Very Different from a Large\nCompany’s\nIn an existing company, job titles reflect the way tasks are organized to\nexecute a known business model. For example, the “Sales” title in an existing\ncompany means there’s a sales team repeatedly selling a known product to a\nwell-understood group of customers, using a standard corporate presentation\nwith an existing price list and standard terms, conditions and contract. The\n“Sales” title in an existing company is all about execution around a series of\nknowns.\nCompared with big companies, startups need executives whose skills are\n180 degrees different. Startups demand execs who are comfortable with\nuncertainty, chaos and change—with presentations and offers changing\ndaily, with the product changing often, with probing and gaining insights\nfrom failure rather than high-fiving a success. In short, they need the rare\nbreed:\nopen to learning and discovery—highly curious, inquisitive, and creative\neager to search for a repeatable and scalable business model\nagile enough to deal with daily change and operating “without a map”\nreadily able to wear multiple hats, often on the same day\ncomfortable celebrating failure when it leads to learning and iteration\nWe suggest replacing traditional execution-oriented sales, marketing and\nbusiness development titles with a single title: the Customer Development\nteam. At first, this “team” will consist of the company’s founder(s), who talks\nwith customers to gain enough insights to develop the minimum viable\nproduct. Later, as the startup moves into customer validation, the team may\ngrow to include a dedicated “sales closer” responsible for the logistics of\ngetting early orders signed. The closer shouldn’t be confused with a\ntraditional sales VP. To succeed in this process, the team must have:\nthe ability to listen to customer objections and understand whether they\nare issues about the product, the presentation, the pricing or something\nelse (or the wrong type of customer)\nexperience in talking to and moving between customers and engineers\nconfidence amid a state of constant change, often operating “without a\nmap”\nthe ability to walk in their customers’ shoes, understanding how they\nwork and the problems they face\nSome would say this checklist isn’t bad for identifying great entrepreneurs.\nRule No. 12:\nPreserve All Cash Until Needed. Then Spend.\nThe goal of Customer Development is not to avoid spending money but to\npreserve cash while searching for the repeatable and scalable business\nmodel. Once found, then spend like there’s no tomorrow. This paragraph is\nworth deconstructing:\nPreserve cash: When a startup has unlimited cash (Internet bubbles,\nfrothy venture climate), it can iterate on its mistakes by burning more dollars.\nWhen money is tight, without dollars to redo mistakes, it’s crucial to\nminimize waste. The Customer Development process preserves cash by not\nhiring any sales and marketing staff until the founders turn hypotheses into\nfacts and discover a viable product/market fit.\nWhile searching: Customer Development observes that at the start, the\ncompany and its business model are based solely on hypotheses, not facts,\nand that the founders need to get out of the building to turn these hypotheses\ninto customer data. This “get out of the building” approach, combined with\nrapid iteration and pivots, is central to the model’s customer discovery and\nvalidation steps.\n...preserve cash while searching for the repeatable\nand scalable business model...\nRepeatable: Startups may get orders that stem from board members’\ncustomer relationships, engineering one-offs, or heroic single-shot efforts by\nthe CEO. These are great, but they aren’t repeatable by a sales organization.\nSearch not for the one-off revenue hits but rather for a pattern that can be\nreplicated by a sales organization selling off a price list or by customers\nregularly visiting the website.\nScalable: The goal is not to get one customer but many—and for each\nadditional customer to add incremental revenue and profit. The test is: Does\nthe addition of one more salesperson or more marketing dollars bring in more\ngross profit (or users or clicks) than you invested? Who influences a sale?\nWho recommends a sale? Who is the decision-maker? Who is the economic\nbuyer? Where’s the budget for purchasing this type of product? What’s the\ncustomer acquisition cost? Affirming the repeatable, scalable sales model is\nthe customer validation step of Customer Development, its most important\nphase. Has the team learned how to sell a target customer? Can this happen\nbefore the startup runs out of money?\nSearch not for the one-off revenue hits but rather\nfor a pattern...\nBusiness model: A business model answers the basic questions of how\nthe company makes money. Is this a revenue play, or is it a freemium model\nseeking users? Something else? Who’s the customer?\nSpend like there’s no tomorrow: The goal of an investor-backed startup\nis not to build a lifestyle business. The goal is to reach venture scale (10\ntimes the return on investment or more). When management and board agree\nthat they’ve found a repeatable and scalable sales model (i.e., have a\nproduct/market fit), then invest the dollars to create end-user demand and\ndrive those customers into the sales channel.\nRule No. 13:\nCommunicate and Share Learning\nAn integral part of Customer Development’s “learning and discovery”\nphilosophy is sharing everything that’s learned outside the building with\nemployees, co-founders and even investors.\nThe traditional way to do this is via weekly company meetings to keep\nemployees informed and board meetings to let the investors understand the\nprogress made in the search for the business model. But technology in the\n21st-century has taken us to places we never could get to before. We can now\ncommunicate all we’re learning in near-real time to everyone who needs to\nknow.\nWe strongly recommend that the founders keep and share all their\nactivities in the customer discovery step via a blog, CRM or product\nmanagement tool. A powerful tool to help founding team members and their\ninvestors and advisors communicate about progress in evolving their business\nmodel and sharing or discussing customer discovery has been developed in\nconcert with the authors and can be found at LaunchPadCentral.com. It\nrecords hypotheses the startup started with, who the team has talked to, the\nquestions asked, the tests conducted, what’s been learned, and questions for\nadvisors or investors. While this may seem burdensome, it takes less time\nthan having a weekly coffee with an advisory board member. What results is\na communications tool allowing outsiders to view the company’s progress up\nclose and to offer suggestions and course corrections.\nRule No. 14:\nCustomer Development Success Begins With BuyIn\nCustomer Development’s “learning and discovery” philosophy can be\nimmensely disorienting to a founder, engineer or investor who has spent his\nor her career executing a plan. For Customer Development to succeed,\neveryone on the team—from investor or parent company to engineers,\nmarketeers and founders—needs to understand and agree that the Customer\nDevelopment process is different to its core. If the engineering VP is talking\nwaterfall development or the board demands a rigid timetable, Customer\nDevelopment is destined for disaster. Everyone must accept the process,\nrecognizing that this is a fluid, nonlinear search for a business model that can\nsometimes last for years.\nThe Customer Development process is different to\nits core.\nCustomer Development changes almost every aspect of startup behavior,\nperformance, metrics, and, as often as not, success potential. It’s not just a\n“nice to do” while executing the revenue model in the back of the business\nplan. Customer Development reinvents the business model on the fly,\niterating often and pivoting whenever indicated. Founders need to have the\ncommitment of the team and board before embarking on Customer\nDevelopment. Ensure that all understand and agree that it’s iterative,\nnecessary, and worthwhile and that it changes the benchmarks and metrics\nalong the way.\nComments such as “The product is already spec’ed, and we can’t change\nthe features since development is already underway,” or “We already have\nthe factory (or sales team or marketing materials) built,” or “We have to\nlaunch to make the numbers in the plan,” are all red flags. To succeed at\nCustomer Development, the company must abandon the old model’s\nemphasis on execution of a fantasy business plan. Instead it must commit to a\nCustomer Development process stressing learning, discovery, failure, and\niteration in the search for a successful business model. If you’re ready for this\nprocess, this book will tell you how to do it.\nSummary: The Customer Development\nProcess\nThe Customer Development process reflects the best practices of winning\nstartups. It is the only approach for web-based businesses where failure is\ncertain without constant customer feedback and product iteration as they\nsearch for their audiences. Customer Development’s fast cycle times and\ninherent cash conservation gives all entrepreneurs more chances to pivot,\niterate, and succeed before the bank account runs dry. Describe this model to\nentrepreneurs who have taken companies all the way to a lucrative exit and\nbeyond, and heads nod in recognition.\nWhile each step has its own specific objectives, the process as a whole\nhas one overarching goal: discovering the repeatable, scalable, and ultimately\nprofitable business before running out of cash. This transforms the company\nfrom a set of founding hypotheses into a moneymaking endeavor.\nCustomer Development is damn hard work. You\ncan’t fake it.\nCustomer Development is damn hard work. You can’t fake it. You can’t\njust do the slides or “do” the process in a weekend. It’s a full-time, full-bodycontact sport. It’s a long-term commitment to changing the way a startup is\nbuilt.

Founded by Motorola and a global partnership of\n18 companies in 1991, Iridium planned to build a mobile telephone system\nthat would work “anywhere on Earth,” from ships in the middle of the ocean\nto the jungles of Africa to remote mountain peaks where no cell towers\nexisted.\nHow? With an out-of-this-world business plan. First, the company\nbought a fleet of 15 rockets from Russia, the U.S. and China. Next, it\nlaunched an armada of 72 private satellites into orbit, where they acted like\n500-mile-high cell towers providing phone coverage to any spot on Earth.\nSeven years after Iridium’s founding, its satellites were in place. But nine\nmonths after the first call was made in 1998, the company was in Chapter 11\nbankruptcy. When Iridium crashed back to Earth, it ranked as one of the\nlargest startup failures on record. What went wrong?\nWhen Iridium was founded in 1991, worldwide cell-phone coverage was\nsparse, unreliable and expensive. Cell-phone handsets were the size of lunch\nboxes. Iridium put together a business plan that made assumptions about\ncustomers, their problems and the product needed to solve those problems.\nOther assumptions about sales channel, partnerships, and revenue model all\nadded up to a set of financial forecasts that Iridium would soon be printing\nmoney.\nOne of the largest startup failures on record as they\nexecuted their business plan.\nBut in the seven-plus years it took Iridium to go from concept to launch,\ninnovation in mobile- and cell-phone networks moved at blinding speed. By\nthe time Iridium launched, there were far fewer places on the planet where\ncell-phone service was unavailable. Traditional cell-phone companies\nprovided coverage in the most valuable parts of the world. Prices for cell\nservice shrunk as fast as phone handsets did. In contrast, Iridium’s satellite\nphone was bigger than a brick and weighed about as much. Worse, Iridium’s\ncell phone couldn’t make calls from cars or buildings, since it required lineof-sight “connection” to the satellites. Instead of 50 cents per minute for a\nregular cell call, Iridium’s calls cost $7 a minute, plus $3,000 for the handset\nitself.\nIridium’s potential market shrunk nearly every day. Instead of a massive\nworldwide market of potential users, it had drawn only a small group willing\nto pay its prices and put up with the product’s many limitations. But\nIridium’s business model assumptions and plans were firmly fixed as if it was\nstill 1991. The company spent $5 billion building a business over eight years\nwithout ever focusing on four key questions:\nHave we identified a problem a customer wants to see solved?\nDoes our product solve this customer problem or need?\nIf so, do we have a viable and profitable business model?\nHave we learned enough to go out and sell?\nAnswering these questions is the purpose of the first step in the\ncustomer discovery process. This chapter explains how to go about it.\n(Twenty years later, Iridium emerged from bankruptcy. In 2000, an\ninvestor group bought $6 billion worth of its assets for $25 million. After a\nlong climb back, the company celebrated its 500,000\nth customer in September\n2011.)\nCustomers don’t behave like your business plan.\nThe Customer Discovery Philosophy\nA startup begins with the vision of its founders: a vision of a new product or\nservice that solves a customer’s problems or needs and of how it will reach\nits many customers. Customer discovery lowers the odds of spending zillions\nand getting zeros in return as the Iridium team did. So the No. 1 goal of\ncustomer discovery amounts to this: turning the founders’ initial hypotheses\nabout their market and customers into facts.\nGet Out of the Building\nFacts exist only outside the building, where customers live, so the most\nimportant aspect of customer discovery is getting out of the building, in front\nof customers. And not for a few days or a week, but repeatedly, over weeks if\nnot months. This critical task can’t be assigned to junior staffers and must be\ndriven by founders. Only after the founders have performed this step will\nthey know whether they have a valid vision or just a hallucination.\nSounds simple, doesn’t it? But for anyone who has worked in\nestablished companies, the customer discovery process is disorienting. All the\nrules about new-product management in large companies are turned upside\ndown. It’s instructive to enumerate all things you are not going to do:\nunderstand the needs and wants of all customers\nmake a list of all the features customers want before they buy your\nproduct\nhand Product Development a features list of the sum of all customer\nrequests\nhand Product Development a detailed marketing-requirements document\nrun focus groups and test customers’ reactions to your product to see if\nthey will buy\nWhat you are going to do is develop your product for the few, not the\nmany. Moreover, you’re going to start building your product even before you\nknow whether you have any customers for it.\nOn a startups first day, there’s limited—if any—\ncustomer input.\nFor an experienced marketing or product management executive, these\nideas are not only disorienting and counterintuitive but heretical. Why aren’t\nthe needs of all potential customers important? What is it about a first\nproduct from a new company that’s different from follow-on products in a\nlarge company? What is it about a startup’s first customers that make the\nrules so different?\nSearch for the Problem/Solution Fit\nThe customer discovery process searches for problem/solution fit: “have we\nfound a problem lots of people want us to solve (or a need they want us to\nfill)” and “does our solution (a product, a website, or an app) solve the\nproblem in a compelling way?” At its core, the essence of customer discovery\nis to determine whether your startup’s value proposition matches the\ncustomer segment it plans to target.\nProblem/solution fit is virtually identical to what’s sometimes called\n“product/ market fit,” as the previous paragraph indicates. As a result, we use\nthe terms somewhat interchangeably throughout the book. Do realize,\nhowever, that in multi-sided markets, there may be multiple value\npropositions and multiple customer segments. But problem/solution fit is\nonly achieved when the revenue model, pricing, and customer acquisition\nefforts all match up with the customers’ needs.\nDevelop the Product for the Few, Not the Many\nIn existing companies, the goal of traditional product management and\nmarketing is to develop a market-requirements document (MRD) for\nengineering that contains the sum of all possible customer feature requests,\nprioritized in a collaborative effort among Product Management, Marketing,\nSales, and Engineering. Marketing or Product Management hosts focus\ngroups, analyzes sales data from the field, and looks at customer feature\nrequests and complaints. This information leads to the adding of requested\nfeatures to the product specification, and the engineering team builds them\ninto the next product release.\nWhile this process is rational for an established company entering an\nexisting market, it’s folly for startups. Why? Startups aren’t small versions of\nlarge, existing companies where there’s plenty of customer knowledge and\ninput. In established companies, the MRD process ensures that engineering\nwill build a product that appeals to existing customers in a known market,\nwhere customers and their needs are known. On a startup’s first day, there’s\nlimited—if any—customer input for creating a formal product specification.\nIn a startup, the first product is not designed to satisfy a mainstream\ncustomer. No startup can afford to build a product with every feature a\nmainstream customer needs all at once. The product would take years to get\nto market and be obsolete by the time it arrived. Instead, successful startups\nsolve this conundrum by focusing development and early selling efforts on a\nvery small group of early customers who have bought into the startup’s\nvision. These visionary customers will give the company the feedback\nnecessary to add features to the product over time.\nEarlyvangelists are willing to make a leap of faith\nand buy an early product.\nEarlyvangelists: The Most Important Customers of\nAll\nEnthusiasts who spread the good news about your product to friends, family\nor co-workers are often called evangelists. But a new word is needed to\ndescribe the early adopters—the visionary customers—who buy unfinished\nand untested products, because they want to “first,” whether it’s for the sake\nof gaining a competitive edge or winning bragging rights. We call these early\nadopters earlyvangelists. Unlike “mainstream” business or consumer-product\ncustomers who want to buy a finished, completed, tested product,\nearlyvangelists are willing to make a leap of faith and buy an early product\nfrom a startup. Every industry has a small subset of visionaries willing to take\na leap of faith on an early product.\nOne of the mistakes that startup founders make is to give away or\nheavily discount early alpha/beta products to blue-chip customers. In singlesided markets (where the user is the payer) earlyvangelists will be happy to\npay for early access to the product. If they won’t, they aren’t earlyvangelists.\nTheir willingness to pay is a critical part of the customer discovery process.\nYou’ll use it to test the entire buying process.\nEarlyvangelist Characteristics (Figure 2.1)\nIn web/mobile apps, where multi-sided markets (separate users and\npayers) are often found, earlyvangelists can be users or payers. But even as\nnonpaying users, these earlyvangelists are willing or eager accelerators of\nyour viral growth.\nEarlyvangelists are willing or eager accelerators of\nyour viral growth.\nIn both physical and web/mobile channels, earlyvangelists display these\ncommon characteristics (see Figure 2.1):\nThey have a problem or need.\nThey understand they have a problem.\nThey’re actively searching for a solution and have a timetable for\nfinding it.\nThe problem is so painful that they’ve cobbled together an interim\nsolution.\nThey’ve committed, or can quickly acquire, budget dollars to purchase.\nThink of earlyvangelists’ characteristics along a scale of customer pain.\nEarlyvangelist customers will be found only at the top of the scale—those\nwho have already been looking for a solution, built a home-grown solution\n(whether in a company by building a software solution or at home by taping\ntogether a fork, a light bulb and a vacuum cleaner) and have or can acquire a\nbudget. These people are perfect earlyvangelist candidates. They can be\nrelied on for feedback and initial sales; they’ll tell others about the product\nand spread the word that the vision is real. Moreover, they can be potential\nadvisory board candidates (more about advisory boards in Chapter 5).\nBuild a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) First\nThe idea that a startup builds its product for a small group of initial customers\nrather than devising a generic mainstream spec is radical. What follows is\nequally revolutionary.\nThe goal of the MVP is to build the smallest possible\nfeature set.\nOn the day the company starts, there is very limited customer input. All\nthe startup has is a vision of what the problem, product and solution seem to\nbe. Unfortunately, it’s either a vision or a hallucination. The company doesn’t\nknow who its initial customers are or what features they’ll want. One option\nis to start developing an entire full-featured first release of the product, with\nevery feature the founders can think of. We now know this results in wasted\nengineering effort, time and cash, as customers don’t use, want or need most\nof the features developed without their input.\nAnother path is to put Product Development on hold until the Customer\nDevelopment team can find customers who can provide adequate feedback.\nThe risk here is lost time and no product for customers to provide feedback\nagainst. A third, more productive approach is to develop the core features of\nthe product (incrementally and iteratively with agile engineering methods),\nwith the feature list driven by the vision and experience of the company’s\nfounders. This is a minimum viable product.\nThe goal of customer discovery is to test your understanding of the\ncustomer’s problem and see if your proposed solution will prompt him to use\nor buy the product based on its most important features alone. Most users\nwant finished products, but earlyvangelists are the perfect target for the MVP.\nTailor the initial product release to satisfy their needs. If no one thinks your\nMVP solution is interesting or sufficient, iterate or pivot until an adequate\nnumber say “yes.”\nThe shift in thinking to an incremental and iterative MVP as opposed to\na fully featured first product release is important. Engineers tend to make a\nproduct bigger and more perfect. The MVP helps them focus the most\nimportant and indispensable features. Your goal in having an MVP is not to\ngather feature requests to change the product or to make the feature set larger.\nInstead, the goal is to put the MVP in front of customers to find out whether\nyou understood the customer problem well enough to define key elements of\nthe solution. Then you iteratively refine the solution. If, and only if, no\ncustomers can be found for the most important features of the MVP, bring\ncustomers’ additional feature requests to the product development team. In\nthe Customer Development model, feature requests to an MVP are by\nexception and iteration rather than by rule. This eliminates the endless list of\nfeature requests that often delay first customer ship and drive product\ndevelopment teams crazy.\nMVPs for Web/Mobile Are Different\nWeb/mobile businesses conduct customer discovery differently from those in\nthe physical channel. They can reach hundreds or thousands more customers\nby combining online and face-to-face interactions. They place a greater\nemphasis on customer acquisition, activation, and referrals. Web/mobile\nminimum viable products can be developed faster and delivered earlier,\naccelerating the discovery process. When delivered, they can conduct more\ntests with customers, with more granular customer-response data. This results\nin a faster iteration of the problem statement, the proposed solution, and the\nMVP itself.\nFor web/mobile startups, here’s how the MVP is used in the discovery\nprocess:\nDeveloping the Minimum Viable Product for a Web/Mobile Product\n(Figure 2.2)\nUse the Business Model Canvas as The Customer\nDiscovery Scorecard\nOften there’s a lack of a shared and clear understanding of the business\nmodel throughout the company. This customer discovery step uses Alexander\nOsterwalder’s business model canvas to diagrammatically illustrate how a\ncompany intends to make money. As shown in Figure 2.3 the canvas\nrepresents any company in nine boxes, depicting the details of a company’s\nproduct, customers, channels, demand creation, revenue models, partners,\nresources, activities and cost structure. (We described the business model\ncanvas in detail in the Customer Development Manifesto.)\nBusiness Model Canvas (Figure 2.3)\nIn this phase you’ll develop a one- or two-page brief about each of the\nfollowing boxes in the business model canvas:\nMarket Size: how big the opportunity is\nValue Proposition, Part 1: the product/service, its benefits and minimum\nviable product\nCustomer Segments: who the customer is and what problems the\nproduct solves\nChannels: how the product will be distributed and sold\nCustomer Relationships: how demand will be created\nValue Proposition, Part 2: market-type hypothesis and competitive set/\ndifferentiation\nKey Resources: suppliers, commodities, or other essential elements of\nthe business\nKey Partners: other enterprises essential to success of the business\nRevenue Streams: revenue and profit sources and size\nWhen you first draft your initial hypotheses your canvas begins to fill\nup, looking like Figure 2.4.\nSample Business Model Canvas—Initial Hypotheses (Figure 2.4)\nBut in addition to using the business model canvas as a static snapshot\nof the business at a single moment, frozen in time, Customer Development\nuses the canvas as a “scorecard” to track progress in searching for a business\nmodel.\nOnce a week update the canvas to reflect any pivots or iterations,\nhighlighting in red the changes from the last week.\nThen after you and your team agree on the changes to your business\nmodel, integrate them into what becomes your new canvas for the week (the\naccepted changes in red are then shown in black). During the next week any\nnew changes are again shown in red. Then the process repeats each week –\nnew changes showing up in red. Then a new canvas used for the week.\nThis method highlights the changes over time for your and the team’s\nreference. Figure 2.5 shows how the canvases will look over time.\nUsing the Business Model Canvas as a Weekly Scorecard (Figure 2.5)\nHad they read this book, and gotten out of the building, the folks at\nIridium might have saved billions by learning just how small the market for\ntheir business had become. It would have allowed them to search for\nalternatives and survival.\nTo sum up the customer discovery philosophy: whether there’s\nproduct/market fit by finding earlyvangelists, understanding their needs, and\nverifying that the initial minimum viable product solves a problem they’ll\neagerly pay to have solved. And if not, use near-continuous customer\nfeedback to drive agile, frequent changes in product and business model\nalike.\nAs you complete the hypothesis development, your business model\ncanvas quickly becomes multi-dimensional. You are really developing three\ninitial canvases:\nCore elements of the business model itself (value proposition, channel,\netc.)\nHypotheses you have for each element of the business model (such as\n“people will want these features, “or “customers will buy our product\nbecause...”)\nAnd a layer outlining the key pass/fail tests you will use to get face-toface with customers and use their feedback to convert your hypotheses\ninto facts.\nOverview of Customer Discovery\nCustomer Discovery: Overview of the Process (Figure 2.6)\nCustomer Discovery has Four Phases\nPhase 1 deconstructs the founders’ vision into the nine parts of the business\nmodel canvas (product, customers, channels, demand creation, revenue\nmodels, partners, resources, activities and cost structure). Then your team\nwrites one-page briefs about each of the hypotheses, including the list of\nexperiments or tests you’ll need to conduct to prove or disprove each one.\nIn Phase 2 you conduct experiments to test your “problem” hypotheses. This\nhelps you understand how important the problem is and how big it can\nbecome. You do so by testing most elements of the business model, including\nthe value proposition, pricing, channel strategy, and sales process. Your goal\nis to turn hypotheses into facts or discard them if they’re wrong, and replace\nthem with new hypotheses. In the process, you’ll gain a deep understanding\nof customers’ business, workflow, organization, and product needs. When all\nthe facts are in, update your results on the canvas.\nWeb-based products and channels often implement much of Phase 2\nonline in near-real time.\nIn Phase 3, you test your “solution,” presenting your value proposition\n(product, pricing, features, and other business model components) and the\nminimum viable product to customers and compare their responses to the\n“pass/fail” goals you developed earlier. For a web-based product, the\nMVP is a live site, a live demo, or a feature or piece of functionality or\ncontent. The goal is not to sell the product, but to validate how well you\nunderstood the problem in Phase 2 when you heard customers say, “Even\nthese minimum features solve our problems,” or, “I need this product.”\nIdeally, customers ask, “When can I get it?”\nOnline, customers should engage and interact, spend time on it or\nwith it, appear in droves, come back again and again, and bring their friends.\nIn Phase 4 you stop and assess the results of the experiments you’ve\nconducted and verify that you have:\na full understanding of customers’ problems, passions, or needs\nconfirmed the value proposition solves problems, passions or needs\ndetermined that a sizable volume of customers exists for the product\nlearned what customers will pay for the product\nmade certain the resulting revenue should deliver a profitable business\nWith your product features and business model validated, decide\nwhether you have learned enough to go out and try to sell a select your\nproduct to a few visionary customers, or whether you need to go back to\ncustomers to learn some more. If, and only if, you are successful in this step\ndo you proceed to customer validation.\nThat’s customer discovery in a nutshell. The remainder of this section\ndetails each of the phases just described.\nNow let’s get started.\n\nCHAPTER 3\nCustomer Discovery, Phase One: State\nYour Business Model Hypotheses\nTHE DIAGRAM ABOVE IS AN OVERVIEW OF PHASE 1 of customer discovery.\nNote that hypotheses for physical products often differ from web/mobile\nproducts. Where the hypothesis issues differ, each is described separately,\nphysical startups in the upper, lighter-tinted row and web/mobile startup\nconsiderations in the lower, darker row.\nThis phase starts by developing a rough market size estimate to size the\nopportunity for your new venture. Next, the rest of customer discovery uses\nthe business model canvas to record short summaries (hypothesis briefs) of\ninitial hypotheses about your business. The canvas provides a picture of the\nbusiness model on a single page, serving as a reference for team members\nand a scorecard keeping track of pivots and iterations as the company’s\nbusiness model changes.\nThe hypothesis briefs provide the detail, but remain short and to the\npoint, with enough clarity to ensure that all team members understand their\nmeaning. No hypothesis brief should be more than two pages, and as a rule,\nbullet points are far more helpful than paragraphs or even sentences. Almost\nevery hypothesis concludes with the experiments you’ll use in phases 2 and\n3, when you’re out of the building talking to customers to prove or disprove\nthe hypothesis. Sometimes you’ll even need to get out of the building to do\nsome research just to figure out what tests to conduct and the kinds of results\nto shoot for.\nInitially, some briefs may seem shockingly empty. Not to worry—these\nbriefs serve as an outline. The team will return to them often, filling in the\nblanks and modifying original hypotheses with new facts learned along the\nway.\nMarket Size Hypothesis\nThis brief is an outlier—it doesn’t directly map onto the business model\ncanvas. But because there’s nothing worse than spending years in a startup\nonly to discover that it can never grow to more than a few million dollars in\nrevenue, the market size hypotheses help you size the opportunity of your\nstartup market. Estimating market size helps determine whether the payoff\nfrom your new venture is worth the toil, sweat and tears, or whether you’re\nabout to do your first pivot.\nAligning investor and founder objectives clearly at the outset is good\n“life insurance” for founders, since few disconnects cost founders their jobs\nmore quickly than disputes over goals and gold.\n...few disconnects cost founders their jobs more\nquickly than disputes over goals and gold.\nThe thinking applies regardless of whether it’s in the physical or\nweb/mobile channel. With one exception: buyable startups founded for a fast\nsale to a larger-platform player like Facebook or Google. Buyable startups\nshould consider the size of what ís often a microsegment of a large market.\nMarket opportunities are fueled by three ingredients: a large number of\npotential active users or customers, clear future-user growth in a market with\nrapid and predictable growth, and the opportunity to attract active customers\nor users.\nTAM, SAM and Target Market\nMarketers and their investors typically think of market size as three numbers;\nTAM (total addressable market), SAM (served available market) and target\nmarket. The TAM for makers of a new smartphone app might be the 1 billion\ntotal smartphone owners worldwide, but if the application is available only in\nEnglish or works only on an iPhone, the SAM or potential market served is\nfar smaller. And the target market might be Apple App Store customers, so\nyour next step would be to estimate what percentage of those shoppers might\nactually buy. Each estimate further narrows the target market.\nTAM = how big is the universe\nSAM = how many can I reach with my sales channel\nTarget Market (for a startup) = who will be the most likely buyers\nTAM, SAM and Target Market (Figure 3.1)\nEstimating TAM and SAM and target market is a good starting point for\nthe market size hypothesis. Customers will help turn these hypotheses into\nfacts.\nA top-down estimate is a first step. Use industry-analyst reports, marketresearch reports, competitors’ press releases, university libraries—and\ndiscussions with investors and customers to “size” the overall market. Use\nwhatever metric is most appropriate—units, dollars, page views, eyeballs,\nwhatever.\nA note of caution: First-time entrepreneurs are seduced by market size\ndata from research firms. They should keep in mind that market research\nfirms are excellent at predicting the past. (If they were geniuses at predicting\nthe future, they’d be running hedge funds.)\nTherefore, a bottom-up estimate is usually more realistic for startups.\nToy makers, for example do this quite easily: there are roughly 2 million girls\nborn in the U.S. each year, and half can’t afford a $90 doll, so the U.S. target\nmarket for a new doll for girls age 6 to 8 is at most 3 million.\nMarket research firms are great at predicting the\npast.\nIn assessing an existing or re-segmented market, be sure to consider the\nadjacent markets that customers might switch from. Millions of BlackBerry\nusers traded in their RIM devices when Apple’s iPhone arrived, for example.\nWill the startup’s new product have the competitive power to encourage\nswitching? Count only the switchable subset and beware of long-term\ncontracts, service contracts, and “sunk costs” like training or installation, all\nof which are often hidden barriers to switching.\nOf course, nobody can compute a new market’s size today, since it\ndoesn’t exist yet. What to do? Estimate the opportunity based on proxies and\nadjacent markets. See if there are any comparable companies. Have others\ngrown as fast as the estimate? Why will this startup perform similarly?\nSizing the web/mobile market\nWhile some like to quote web/mobile market sizes in terms of eyeballs, page\nviews, downloads, referrals, or hours, at the end of the day it’s still about\nrevenue. What confuses new entrepreneurs is that web/mobile markets may\nbe multi-sided—the users (who may not pay) may be measured in eyeballs,\npage views, downloads, referrals, or hours, but there had better be payers\nwho offer dollars for access to those users.\nFor example, market size could be calculated by multiplying the number\nof eyeballs by the dollars that each eyeball is worth to a payer.\nGathering a massive, growing audience efficiently and cost-effectively\nis job No. 1 for most web/mobile products (e-commerce is often an\nexception, as are niche vertical sites). This is the time to develop an initial\nhypothesis about where that audience might come from and how big it can\nbecome. At this stage, most web/mobile startups follow the\nGoogle/Facebook/YouTube strategy: gather a (hopefully massive) audience\nfirst and be sure it “sticks.” Monetize it later.\nGathering a massive, growing audience efficiently\nand cost-effectively is job No. 1.\nCalculating the audience without understanding who will pay money to\naccess that audience is a mistake. In a multi-sided market, you need to\nestimate all sides of the market, particularly the side that will pay.\nAn easy way to gauge the “size” of a web market involves the free use\nof Google tools. Brainstorm all the keywords that prospective customers\nmight use to find your product or site—“multiplayer monster games,”\n“computer games with monsters,” “creatures and online games” and on and\non. The Google keyword tool summarizes how many people are searching for\neach keyword. Make some allowances for overlap or duplication in a month\nand this is yet another way to develop an estimate of market size. It’s\nespecially effective at identifying whether you’re in a market that’s too small\nto pursue—one where the total number of searches is measured in thousands,\nfor example.\nAnother way to approach the market-sizing question is the “30/10/10”\nlaw of web/mobile “physics,” first posited by leading venture capitalist Fred\nWilson. Wilson observed that, across his entire portfolio of mobile apps,\ngames, social and music services, this law applies consistently:\nThirty percent of registered users and those downloading mobile apps\nwill use the service each month.\nTen percent of registered users and those downloading mobile apps will\nuse the service each day.\nConcurrent users of a real-time service will seldom exceed 10 percent of\nthe number of daily users.\nIndustry research will also help immensely in the market-sizing\nexercise. Learn how to research your market in Phase 2, Customer\nUnderstanding, which describes web-specific research tools and tactics.\nChecklist 3: Market Size\nGoal: Estimate the total market opportunity for the company\nReference: Chapter 3, Market Size Hypothesis\nEstimated market size:\nTAM or Total Available Market\nSAM or Served Available Market\nTarget Market\nEstimate current product and follow-on products\nAppropriate metric for measuring determined\nUnits/dollars/page views/other measures?\nPer member for subscription services/per page view for advertisingsupported businesses?\nResearch conducted to “size” the overall market\nRead industry analyst reports, market research reports, competitors’\npress releases, etc.\nTalk with investors and customers\nIf assessing an existing or resegmented market, adjacent markets that\ncustomers might switch from are considered\nWill the startup’s product encourage switching?\nOnly the switchable subset counted (Beware of long-term lock-ins\nfrom incumbents)\nGrowth computed for all customer sources over 3-5 years\nIf assessing a new market, the opportunities are estimated based on\nproxies and adjacent markets\nAre there comparable companies?\nHave others grown as fast as the estimate?\nWhy will this company perform similarly?\nExit criteria:\nWritten sense of market size, estimate of how much the company can\ncapture\nPass/Fail tests identified\nValue Proposition 1: “Low Fidelity” MVP\nHypothesis\nThe MVP brief is a concise summary of the low fidelity web/mobile\nfeatures that will work as a stand-alone product.\nThe first two MVP steps—crafting the company’s long-term vision and\nlisting the product’s features and benefits—are virtually identical to those\noutlined in the following Physical MVP section, so they aren’t repeated here.\nReview those steps and develop those hypothesis statements before starting\nhere.\nThe low fidelity MVP tests whether you’ve\naccurately identified a problem that customers care\nabout.\nIn web/mobile channels, the MVP plays an even more important role\nthan it does in the physical channel. It exposes the product to prospects as\nearly as possible, even as continuous deployment adds new features,\nfunctionality or graphics. A low fidelity MVP can be as simple as a single\nweb page used to gather customer feedback about the problem the product\nwill solve. For web-based startups using agile development and continuous\ndeployment, the delivery date for the low fidelity MVP is basically Day One.\nIdeally, though, it’s a snapshot of the product as it exists on that day in the\nagile development process, in its “quick and dirty” form, even though that\nform will evolve almost every day.\nEven the earliest MVP versions should include some way for interested\nusers to register or self-identify, typically by leaving their e-mail addresses to\nreceive updates. These early users will be helpful throughout the customer\ndiscovery process and beyond.\nWeb/Mobile channels will test both a low fidelity and a hi-fidelity MVP.\nThe low- and hi-fidelity MVPs are used very differently: the low fidelity\nMVP tests whether you’ve accurately identified a problem that customers\ncare about (based on user visits to your site, e-mail received, demos played,\netc.), while the hi-fidelity MVP, detailed in Phase 3, will later test whether\nthe product is on the right path to solving that problem (based on orders\nreceived, users’ stays on the site, users’ recommendations to others, etc.).\nLater, during customer validation, when the hi-fidelity MVP is exposed to\nmany more customers, it should look and operate much more like a finished\nproduct. Taken together, the low and high fidelity MVP tests help establish\nproduct/market fit.\nWrite a User Story instead of a Feature List\nA “user story” is important in web/mobile channels, where intense\ncompetition and millions of online products and properties often make\nproduct differentiation harder to “nail.” For example: There are thousands of\nwebsites for nurses, and a user story can help explain the need for a new one.\nHere’s one: Until now, operating-room nurses had trouble talking to one\nanother about their stresses and “doctor problems” for fear of spawning\ngossip or incurring the wrath of HR. Now “ORNurse,”\n“Nurseconfidential.net” allows these specialized nurses to:\ninteract and chat anonymously with their peers nationwide and beyond\npose questions to fellow nurses in similar situations and collect a variety\nof advice\nobtain advice anonymously from legal, HR, and clinical professionals\nsend private messages to people they’d like to talk with personally\npost anonymous comments about specific doctors, problems, or patient\nsituations\nget a daily e-mail summary of what’s going on at the site\nWhile this isn’t exactly a “feature list,” it provides a good sense of the\nproduct vision, its features and benefits, and why the site will attract a hardto-reach audience.\nChecklist 4: Product Vision\nGoal: Team agreement on the long-term vision and 18-month schedule\nReference: Chapter 3, Value Proposition Hypotheses/Product Vision\nVision\nWhat’s your long-term vision for your company?\nWhat do you ultimately want to change or solve?\nAre you going to do it with a series of products?\nHow do you expand into adjacent markets?\nDo you need to get people to change their behavior?\nWhat will the world look like 3 years after you arrive on the scene?\nFive years?\nPut together a short narrative in bullets about your strategy\nDelivery Dates\nMVP Delivery Date and features\n18-month product vision and delivery dates\nLong Term Product Strategy\nWill your product create network effects?\nCan you price it with a predicable model?\nCan you create customer lock-in/high switching costs?\nCan you have high gross margins?\nDoes it have organic demand versus requiring marketing spend?\nList product enhancements anticipated up to 18 months\nList key follow-on product enhancements\nExit criteria:\nVision\nNarrative\nLong-term product strategy\nUpdate your business model canvas\nPass/Fail tests identified\nChecklist 5: Product Features And Benefits\nGoal: Explain what the product is and why people will buy and use it\nReference: Chapter 3, Product Features/Benefits Hypothesis and LowFidelity MVP Hypothesis\nWhat problem or need are you solving?\nWhat do you think the biggest pain is in how customers work/play?\nIf they could wave a magic wand and change anything what would it\nbe?\nHow does the product solve those problems or needs?\nWhat do people do today to solve their problem?\nProduct Benefits List\nList the benefits through the customer’s eyes\nSomething new? Better? More? Faster? Cheaper? Etc.\nUnderneath the features above, summary benefits for each\nWill these Benefits be accepted as such or do they need explanation?\nDescribe the Minimum Viable Product (MVP)\nWhat do you want to learn?\nFrom who?\nWhat is the smallest feature set?\nCreate a One-Page User Story\nInclude product vision, features, benefits\nExit criteria:\nDescribe the product’s features and benefits\nDescribe the MVP\nCreate a User Story describing what job the product will do\nUpdate your business model canvas\nPass/Fail tests identified\nNote to reader: These following guidelines, geared for physical channel\nstartups, are invaluable to web/mobile startups as well.\nValue Proposition Hypothesis (Part 1/Physical)\nStart this step by filling out your canvas with the value proposition\nhypothesis: the product or service being offered to customers. You’ll include\ndetails about the product, its features and benefits, as well as the company’s\nlong-term product vision and its initial minimum viable product. Think of the\nvalue proposition as a contract between the customer and your company\nwhere the customer “hires” your startup to solve a problem.\nWrite a series of briefs that capture the founders’ hours of thinking,\ntalking, and brainstorming about the product in three separate, specific areas:\nProduct Vision\nProduct Features & Benefits\nMinimum Viable Product (MVP)\nThe product development team produces much of the product brief, one\nof the few times it’s asked to engage in a paper exercise. They put key value\nproposition hypotheses down on paper and turn them into briefs agreed to by\nall executives..\nProduct Vision\nThis portion of the value proposition brief captures your vision for what you\nwant your successful company to become.\nOver time, successful companies are usually more than a single product.\nWhat’s your long-term vision for your company? What do you want to\nultimately change? Are you going to do it with a series of products? How do\nyou expand into adjacent markets? How do you get people to change\nbehavior? What’s the world look like three years after you arrive on the\nscene? Five years after?\nShape a long-term vision with a short narrative told in bullet points. For\nexample in the 1990s, a financial software company might have described its\nuser story this way:\nConsumers hate to reconcile their checkbooks\nWe think we can develop a computer program that emulates a\ncheckbook.\nIt will automate all the hard and tedious parts of home banking\nConsumers can use it to pay bills by connecting to the Internet\nMillions of people will start using home computers to do something they\nnever did before\nToday small businesses use bookkeepers to keep their books\nAfter we succeed in automating consumers we will expand into financial\nsoftware for small businesses\nMillions of small businesses will start using computers to do something\nthey never did before\nSuddenly, the company vision is clear with a few simple bullet points.\nThe vision is critical because the Customer Development team has to paint a\npicture for earlyvangelists of what the product will look like a year or two\ninto the future.\nOnly because earlyvangelists are buying into your\ntotal vision will they spend money for an\nincomplete, buggy, barely functional first product.\nIn the long-term vision, the product team specifies the delivery date for\nthe MVP and for follow-on products or enhancements to the product as far\nout as the team can see (18 months to three years). In startups, this request\nusually elicits a response like, “How can I come up with future dates when\nwe barely know the first MVP delivery date?” Reassure your anxious product\ndevelopment team that this first pass at a schedule isn’t set in stone.\nOnly because earlyvangelists are buying into your total vision will they\nspend money for an incomplete, buggy, barely functional first product. The\nvision should convince everyone involved that this is an opportunity worth\nthe investment of millions of dollars and years of work. Ironically, few\nstartups end up with products that look like their initial vision.\nFinally, it’s never too early to think about strategic issues:\nWill it create network effects? A single fax machine was useless but\nbecame more valuable as more people acquired them\nCan you price it with a predictable pricing model—i.e., subscriptions\nversus one-time sales?\nCan you create customer lock-in/high switching costs? Think of trying\nto get your data from Facebook or from your doctor’s office\nCan you have high gross margins?\nDoes it have organic demand versus marketing spend? Companies with\norganic demand have business models that don’t require expensive\nmarketing. Think Google, eBay, Baidu, Skype, etc.\nProduct Features and Benefits\nThis portion of the value proposition brief captures what the product is and\nwhy people will use or buy it.\nWhile many engineers think new products are all about product features,\nthe product is just one of many elements of a successful startup. The product\nfeatures list is a one-page document consisting of one- or two-sentence\nsummaries of the top 10 (or fewer) features of the complete product vision.\n(If there’s some ambiguity in describing a particular feature, include a\nreference to a more detailed engineering document.)\nEssentially, the feature list is Product Development’s contract with the\nrest of the company. The biggest challenge will be deciding what features\nwill ship in what order. Developing the MVP will start the prioritization\nprocess. Once you get out of the building, customers will guide the process as\nthey begin interacting with the earliest version of the MVP.\nThink of features as the things engineering is building, and think of\nbenefits as the problem you’re solving for the customer.\nThink of benefits as the problem you’re solving for\nthe customer.\nOnce you have the feature list, you shape a product benefits list by\ndescribing the specific product benefits as seen through customers’ eyes.\n(Something new? Something better? Faster? Cheaper?) Then develop a “user\nstory.” This short narrative explains what job the product will do. How will it\nsolve a problem that customers are eager to fix, or fulfill a need they have?\nIdeally, the product solves a mission-critical problem, delivers a compelling,\nexciting consumer benefit, or addresses an unspoken need. (Saves money or\ntime? Relieves a symptom? Fun, relaxing, faster? Better? Cheaper?) A banksoftware company might describe its user story this way:\nCustomers always face long lines at our bank on Fridays and on the first\nand last days of the month when they come in to cash or deposit checks;\nthey get frustrated and often angry\nWe think we lose 5 percent to 8 percent of our customers as a result of\nfrustration\nWe can measure lost profits of about $500,000 a year, significant\nbecause it’s 7 percent of the total\nThis $150,000 software package halves the time it takes to make a\ndeposit and will be even faster in later versions\nWhen thinking about product features, remember that a value\nproposition can take the form of a higher-performance product or a less\nexpensive or more convenient product. It can address a market niche or\nsegment or solve problems in a new or different, faster or cheaper way.\nSometimes the product’s physical or visual design or even the brand itself\nmay be different enough to command attention. Products don’t always solve\nproblems, either. While most business products do, consumer goods more\noften serve needs in areas as diverse as online gaming, social networks,\nfashion, and cars.\nIt’s normal for marketers to want to describe the product benefits, but\nit’s likely that marketing doesn’t have facts about customers yet, just\nopinions. In a startup, the founders and Product Development are likely to be\nthe ones with the facts. So at this point, the marketing people would be wise\nto bite their tongues and listen to the product development group’s\nassumptions about the features and exactly how they’ll benefit customers.\nThese engineering-driven benefits represent hypotheses you’ll test against\nreal customer facts. In Phase 2, you’ll get out of the building to collect this\nfeedback directly from customers.\nMinimum Viable Product (MVP)\nThe MVP is the final portion of this first value proposition brief. It’s a\nconcise summary of the smallest possible group of features that will work as\na stand-alone product while still solving at least the “core” problem and\ndemonstrating the product’s value.\nThe MVP is:\na tactic for cutting back on wasted engineering hours\na strategy to get the product into earlyvangelists hands as soon as\npossible\na tool for generating maximum customer learning in the shortest\npossible time\nStart the MVP brief by defining what needs to be learned—and from\nwhom. Customer Development efforts will engage a very small group of\nearly visionary and passionate customers to guide product-feature\ndevelopment until a profitable business model emerges. The sooner the MVP\nis in their hands, the sooner feedback can arrive. Rather than asking\ncustomers explicitly about feature X, Y or Z, one approach to defining the\nMVP is to ask, “What is the smallest or least complicated problem that the\ncustomer will pay us to solve?”\nThis approach runs counter to the typical cry for more features, which is\noften based on what the competitors have or what the last customer visited\nhad to say. The MVP is the inverse of what most sales and marketing groups\nask of their development teams.\nA goal of Customer Development is to understand\nwhat not to ship.\nStartups tend to collect a list of features that, if added to the product,\nwould get just that one additional customer to buy. Soon a 10-page feature\nlist evolves just to sell to 10 customers. That’s a plan for failure. The goal of\nCustomer Development is not to collect features from customers. It’s to\nunderstand what not to ship. The perfect feature list is just one paragraph\nlong and can be sold to thousands or millions of customers. A core tenet of\nthe Customer Development Manifesto is “less is more.” Minimize the\nnumber of features not used by getting a MVP into customers’ hands as\nquickly as possible. An easy guideline: “no new features until you’ve\nexhausted the search for a business model.”\nCustomer Segments: Source/Wiring Hypothesis\nWhen you’re done with this brief, you’ll have developed a customer\narchetype and be able to say things like, “We believe most of our customers\nare age-18-to-25 tech-savvy young urban professionals who use Macs and\nspend two hours a day on Facebook” or “Twenty-five percent of my\ncustomers read Science and Nature magazine religiously and want a better\nway to order chemical reagents and lab supplies.” And you’ll be able to\nunderstand and draw a day in the life of a customer and draw a consumer web\ninfluence map.\nStart by reviewing the “customer segments/physical” hypotheses.\nThe Customer Archetype: a Guide to Who Your\nCustomers Are\nA customer archetype combines everything you know about your “most\ntypical” customers or users into one or more complete profiles. (Obviously\nnot every customer will look like this homogenized “average.” In fact, you\nmore than likely will have several archetypes.)\nCompile the picture by gathering statistics about customers’\ndemographics and behavior. (For help, see Customer Understanding in Phase\n3.) Use Google Trends, Google Insights, and Facebook ads to look at\nweb/mobile customer demographics. Use Crunchbase to look at who\ncompetitors are selling to. Interview people you think look most like your\npotential customers and understand who they are, what they do, and how they\nbehave. Search online for studies, news articles, and reports about your target\nconsumers. Study competitors’ media choices, press coverage and annual\nreports. Most important, continue to update the archetype as you learn more\nabout customers over time.\nA Guide to Using Customer/Archetypes to Drive Strategy (Figure 3.2)\nAre your target customers or users big executives, networking nannies,\nor teen gamers? Suburbanites or city dwellers? Single or married? Gather as\nmuch detail as possible. How old are they? How much do they earn? How\nmuch leisure time do they typically have and how much spending money?\nFocus on their web/mobile-device ownership or access: desktop, laptop, iPad,\nor smartphone—or all four? Are they loners or social-network heavyweights,\nand do they share sites and information generously with others? When\nthey’re online, are they alone at home or in a crowd at school? Use the\ndetailed example in Figure 3.2 as a guide when developing yours.\n“A Day-in-the-Life”: a Guide to What Customers\nDo\nHow much time do your customers spend online in a typical 24-hour day? Is\nit at their desk, on a laptop, or on a handheld while driving? Your success\ndepends on becoming a regular part of the customer’s day, whether for\ninformation, social networking, play, or e-commerce. But what’s the source\nof the “newfound” time they’ll spend on your new site or using your new\napp? Will they sleep less? Will they spend less time on Facebook or eBay?\nWill they spend less time goofing off at work to spend time at the new site?\nWhat’s the source of the “newfound” time they’ll\nspend on your new site or using your new app?\nBe sure to understand how they find out about new products. Are they\nreligious readers of TechCrunch or People, game-review sites or news feeds?\nDo they Tweet often, and do they read Tweets from two people or 50? Text\ntwice or 100 times a day, and to whom? Where do they go for information\nabout products in general and products like yours, and how often and for how\nlong?\nWhere will you find your customers? On the web, your customers can\nbe anywhere: at niche websites, reading blogs, on Facebook and other social\nnetworks, or on social news sites. The could be Tweeting or reading Tweets,\ntexting or engaging with other similar customers on forums, wikis, and more.\nA Guide to Using A Day-in-the-Life to Drive Strategy (Figure 3.3)\nCreate a “day in the life” scenario using 15- or 30-minute increments\nfrom wakeup to bedtime, paying close attention to time spent on web/mobile\ndevices, specifying not only which device but what your customer is actually\ndoing on the device and for how long: texting with friends, reading blogs\n(note which ones), playing mobile or social games (note which ones),\nshopping for shoes (note where), or posting pictures of her cat on Facebook?\nUse the detailed example in Figure 3.3 as a guide when developing\nyours.\nSummarize the archetype and day-in-a-life in a tight bullet-point format.\nUse those bullets to evaluate the potential value of activities you’ll use to\n“get” customers when developing the upcoming Customer Relationships\nhypothesis. Figures 3.2 and 3.3 offer an example for a company selling\ndownloadable gourmet-cooking lessons targeting working couples who cook\ntogether, and try to do it creatively.\nWhen the customer archetype and “day in the life” are complete, you\nnow know what your customers look like, what they do with their days, and\nhow to find them.\nThis example illustrates how the archetype and “day in the life” efforts\ncan focus “customer acquisition” activity. While there’s no such thing as\nperfect targeting in mass-marketing efforts, fine-tuning every “get customers”\nactivity to “fish where the fish are” helps maximize the return on every\ncustomer-relationships dollar you’ll spend.\nHere’s How to Create a Consumer Web Influence Map:\nIn the web/mobile world, influence maps are as daunting and complex as they\nare influential. Think of the number of ways a consumer can be influenced\nonline, and how your efforts can also influence the influentials themselves as\npart of the marketing process. “Dots” on the online influence map include\nblogs and chat rooms, authoritative websites, social networks, pundits, and\nreferral or reference sites. In addition to delivering direct exposure, these\ninfluencers are often significant sources of “natural search” clicks that bring\npeople to the website.\nConsumer Web Influence Map (Figure 3.4)\nFinally, recognize that in web/mobile apps, you may have multiple\ncustomer segments in a multi-sided market. In this case, “customers” can be\nusers who may pay nothing for the product or service but provide a value to\nthe supplier that it can resell to others. Google is the canonical “multi-sided”\nexample: billions of “customers” search at Google for free, and millions of\nadvertisers pay to reach them. Most social-network and content sites operate\nthis way.\nChecklist 6: Customer Segments\nGoal: Develop a hypothesis of who your customers are and what problems\nthey have that will drive them to use your product\nReference: Chapter 3, Customer Segments and Source Hypotheses\nDefine the Customer Problem\nDoes the customer have a latent, passive, active or vision\nproblem/need?\nDefine the Customer type\nDefine the distinctly different types of “customer”\nWho will be the actual day-to-day users of the product?\nWho are the influencers and recommenders?\nWho is the “Economic Buyer”? (i.e. whose budget will pay for it?)\nDo you think the Economic Buyer has an existing budget for this\nproduct or do they need to get one approved?\nWho are the “Decision Makers?”\nWho else needs to approve the purchase? And who can kill it?\nWhat are the Customer’s wants and needs?\nRated on a “problem recognition scale”\nDoes product solve a mission-critical company problem or satisfy a\nmust-have customer need?\nHow painful is this problem?\nDraw the Customer Archetypes\nDraw the Day in the life of a customer – before and after your product\nDraw the Organizational and customer influence maps\nList those who could influence a customer’s buying decision\nConsider the product’s influence on his daily life\nExit criteria:\nCustomer types and problem or need\nCustomer archetypes\nDepict a day in the life of a customer\nOrganizational and customer influence maps\nUpdate your business model canvas\nPass/Fail tests identified\nNote to reader: These following guidelines, geared for physical channel\nstartups, are invaluable to web/mobile startups as well.\nCustomer Segments: Who/Problem Hypothesis\n(Physical)\nThis brief describes who the customers are (the customer types) and what\nproblems, needs or passions they have. It includes five components:\ncustomer problems, needs or passions\ncustomer types\ncustomer archetypes\na day in the life of customer\norganizational map and customer influence map\nThe Customer Problem, Need or Passion\nProducts are sold because they solve a problem or fill a need. (See the bank\nteller story in Value Proposition.) Understanding problems and needs\ninvolves understanding their sources. Get out of the building to discover how\ncustomers experience the problem and why (and how much) it matters to\nthem. Understand the organizational impact problem, and the intensity of\npain it causes the company/family/consumer. Use a simple “problem\nrecognition scale” for each important type of customer (Figure 3.5).\nCustomers will express:\na latent problem: they have a problem but don’t know it\na passive problem: they know of the problem but aren’t motivated or\naware of the opportunity to change\nan active (or urgent) problem: they recognize a problem or passion and\nare searching for a solution but haven’t done any serious work to solve\nthe problem\na vision: they have an idea for solving the problem and even have\ncobbled together a home-grown solution, but are prepared to pay for a\nbetter one\nStudy the problem. Is your product solving a mission-critical company\nproblem or satisfying a must-have consumer need? Is your product a musthave or a nice-to-have? When your product solves a problem that costs\ncustomers sleep, revenue, or profits, things are definitely looking up. When\nit’s the hottest “new new thing” in town, whether that town is physical or\nvirtual, capitalize on the opportunity. The best startups discover a situation\nwhere customers have tried to build a solution themselves—they\nsimultaneously discover both a mission-critical problem and a customervisualized solution. Wow. Now simply convince the customer that if they\nbuild it themselves, they’re detouring into a different, usually non-core\nbusiness—your new business!\nThe best startups discover a situation where\ncustomers have tried to build a solution themselves.\nThen again, not every product solves problems. Some provide fun or\ninformation, others glamour or romance. Social networks don’t solve\nproblems but sure have millions of visitors—they fill consumer needs and\ndesires. Even if it’s fun or pure luxury, recognize that consumers require\njustification for a purchase.\nAfter identifying the customer types, craft a hypothesis about their\nemotional wants and desires. Describe how to convince these customers that\nthe product can deliver an emotional payoff: glamour, beauty, wealth,\nprestige, a hot date or lost pounds.\nCustomer Types\nWhether a customer is spending time on a social network, buying a stick of\ngum, or purchasing a million-dollar telecom system, every sale involves a set\nof decision-makers. Thus customer analysis starts with an understanding of\nwhat types of customers to approach. Chances are several people in a number\nof categories have problems that your product can solve or needs or\nambitions that it can satisfy. Customer discovery identifies and probes these\ndifferent needs. Customer types include:\nEnd Users: The day-to-day users of a product push the buttons, touch the\nproduct, use it, love it, and hate it. A deep understanding of their needs and\nmotivations is vital, recognizing that the end user may often have the least\ninfluence in the sales or adoption process. This is typically true in complex\ncorporate sales.\nCustomer Types (Figure 3.5)\nInfluencers: At times, the most powerful pressure on a customer’s buying\ndecisions may not be something the startup did directly but something done\nor said by someone who’s uninvolved. In every market or industry, online\nand off, a select group of individuals pioneers the trends, styles and opinions.\nAsk a famous dress designer when a movie star wears her dress to the Oscars.\nOr consider the effect of thousands of people clicking their Facebook “like”\nbutton or Tweeting about a product, ad or service. Sometimes the influencers\nare paid bloggers or pundits in market-research firms. They may be kids or\ncelebrities who wear the latest fashions. Include the target list of outside\ninfluencers and address how they’ll be reached. Free product, payments,\ncelebrity events, free computers and online memberships are among the many\noptions.\nRecommenders: They influence purchase decisions but differ from\ninfluencers because their opinions can make or break a sale. A recommender\ncould be a widely read blogger raving about a new online game, a department\nhead saying any new PCs should come from Dell, a hospital committee\napproving a new medical device, or a spouse with a particularly strong brand\npreference. It can also be an external force like Gartner Group, Forrester\nResearch, Martha Stewart or Consumer Reports.\nEconomic buyers: They sit further up the decision chain and often control or\napprove the purchase or budget. (Important people to know!) They can be\ncorporate VPs, office managers, insurance companies with issuing\nreimbursement codes, teens with allowances, or spouses with vacation\nbudgets.\nDecision-makers: They may be the economic buyers or reside even higher\nup in the decision-making hierarchy. Decision-makers wield the ultimate\npurchase authority and are sometimes called UDMs (ultimate decisionmakers) or VITOs (very important top officers) or perhaps “Mom,” “Dad” or\n“honey.” Be sure to understand their motivations.\nSaboteurs: They can lurk anywhere (as saboteurs do) and hold titles\nincluding CFO, CIO, child, spouse, or purchasing agent with “friends.” They\ncan be found in strategic planning departments or in your own home, where\ntheir veto can slow things dramatically. Find them. Identify patterns that\nreveal where they’re hiding in the decision process.\nLater, during customer validation, knowing all the players in detail will\nbe essential. For now, simply recognize that the customer is more\ncomplicated than a single individual.\nCustomer Archetypes\nRemember the axiom “A picture is worth a thousand words”? There’s no\nbetter way for the startup team to visualize its customer targets than to take\nthe time to depict each of the key customer types—the end user and the\ndecision-maker at a minimum (at least make a few sketches or doodles).\nCustomer archetypes help the team visualize who will buy or use the product\nand helps crystallize product strategy, customer acquisition, and more.\nCustomer Archetype (Figure 3.6)\nIn a business-to-business sale, does the end user work in an office, a\ncubicle or a boiler room? Is he or she a business traveler, a presenter, or a\nheads-down number cruncher? Is the decision-maker in a corner office, is she\na scientist in a research lab with a wall lined with prestigious degrees and\nawards, or is she on the factory floor?\nTo understand more about customer archetypes and how they’re used,\nreview a detailed discussion in the next section, “Customers/Source—\nWeb/Mobile.” Once you’ve read that, create a comprehensive view of each\nkey customer archetype, using the data you collected.\nConsumer archetypes are generally easier to create than business-tobusiness, where relationships are far more complex. Identify as many\nhypotheses about the buyer’s demographic and psychographic profile as\npossible. Is the buyer affluent, fashion-conscious, healthy and active?\nMarried with pets and toddlers or teens? In a house, an apartment, or a trailer\npark? These characteristics will influence many aspects of the business\nmodel, including customer relationships, channel, and revenue model.\nA Day in the Life of a Customer\nOne of the most powerful ways to understand your customers, whether\nthey’re consumer or business customers, is to discover how they “work” and\nwrite it down, delineating a day in their life.\n...discover how customers “work” and write it\ndown, delineating a day in their life.\nIn the case of businesses, this step requires a deep understanding of a\ntarget company on many levels. Let’s use selling software to a bank as an\nexample. How a bank works isn’t something you’ll discover by cashing a\ncheck. You want to know how the world looks from a banker’s perspective.\nTo begin with, how do the potential end users of the product (the tellers)\nspend their days? What products do they use? How much time do they spend\nusing them? How would life change for these users after they have your\nproduct? Unless you’ve been a bank teller, these questions should leave you\nfeeling somewhat at a loss, but how are you going to sell a product to a bank\nto solve tellers’ problems if you don’t understand how they work?\n(If you’re not an experienced salesperson, this whole notion of getting\nout of the building can sound intimidating. The “Get Out of the Building”\nsection of customer discovery, Chapter 4, describes how to set up your first\nmeetings.)\nNow run this exercise from the perspective of branch managers. How do\nthey spend their day? How would your new product affect them? Run it\nagain, this time thinking about bank presidents. What on earth do they do?\nWhat do they read? Who influences their decisions? How will your product\naffect her? And if you’re installing a product that connects to other software\nthe bank has, you’re going to have deal with the IT organization. How do the\nIT people spend their day? What other software do they run? How are their\nexisting systems configured? Who are their preferred vendors? Are they\nstanding at the door with confetti and Champagne waiting to welcome yet\nanother new company with yet another product?\nThe answers are easy. Asking the right questions is\nhard.\nBusiness products are generally purchased because they solve problems,\nso a deep understanding of the buyer is required. If you’re selling a retailer\npoint-of-sale tools, for example, can someone on your team work behind a\nbusy counter for a few days? There’s no better way to understand than to dive\nin. Learn how prospective users currently solve their problems, online or off,\nand how they’d do it differently using the new product. What will motivate\nthese customers to buy? Draw a vivid and specific picture of a day in the life\nof the customer, and do the research in the same place where they do their\nwork or have their fun, not in the company conference room or alone at a\nlocal Starbucks.\nFinally, back to our banking example, do you know about trends in the\nbanking industry? Is there a banking-industry software consortium? Are there\nbank software trade shows? Industry analysts? Unless you’ve come from\nyour target industry, this part of your customer-problem brief may include\nlittle more than lots of question marks. That’s OK. In customer development,\nthe answers turn out to be easy; it’s asking the right questions that’s difficult.\nYou’ll be going out and talking to customers with the goal of filling in all the\nblank spots on the customer-problem brief.\nFor a consumer product, the same exercise is applicable. How do\nconsumers solve their problems today? How would they solve their problems\nwith your product? Would they be happier? Smarter? Feel better? Do you\nunderstand what will motivate these customers to buy?\nYour final exam doesn’t happen until you come back to the company\nand, in meetings with the product development team and your peers, draw a\nvivid and specific picture of a day in the life of your customer.\nA Sample Organizational/Influence Map (Figure 3.7)\nOrganizational/Influence Maps\nNow having a deeper understanding of a customer’s typical day, you realize\nthat except in rare cases, most customers don’t work by themselves.\nConsumers interact with friends and family, while businesspeople interact\nwith their colleagues. List the people who could influence a customer’s\nbuying decisions and draw a tentative diagram of the prospective customer\nand all the influences surrounding him or her. Also depict the product’s\nimpact on their day-to-day work or personal life. Then build a map showing\npotentially influential people who surround the user. At a large company, the\ndiagram will be complex, with lots of initial unknowns.\nChannels Hypothesis\nThe distribution-channel brief describes how a web/mobile product gets\nfrom company to customers.\nBegin this hypothesis development by reading the introduction to the\nphysical channel section, just prior to this one. It addresses general channel\nstrategy and costs of various channels and how they affect revenue.\nWeb/mobile channels can reach billions of wired people worldwide via\ncomputer, tablet, or handheld device. These channels are “always on,” and\nnever sleep, often literally in the palm of a consumer’s hand and usually\nwithin arm’s reach 24 hours a day. The reach, persistence and accessibility of\nthe mobile channel has only just begun to affect the way people live, work,\nbuy, and do.\nA storefront or service solution accessible to literally billions of people\nevery single minute of every day is a marketer’s dream. Web/mobile products\ncan be built quickly and enable a near-instant presence at potentially minimal\ncost—as little as $5 a month for a small online Yahoo store, for example. The\ncompany retains complete control, keeps nearly 100 percent of the revenue\nfrom its direct sales, and can change pricing, promotion and more in mere\nmoments.\nBut the downside of this is that no customers “walk by” the website, and\nthe burden and cost of generating awareness, traffic, and sales falls entirely\non the company. (This is discussed in greater detail later in the customer\nrelationship hypothesis.) Whether it’s a website run by the company itself or\nAmazon.com or Apple’s App Store, success in the web/mobile channel is\nalmost entirely dependent on creating demand, attracting visitors to the site\ncost-effectively, and persuading them to engage with the product or buy it.\nWeb/Mobile Distribution Channel Choices (Figure 3.8)\nWeb/Mobile Channel Choices\nMuch like the physical distribution channel, each web/mobile channel has its\nstrengths, weaknesses, and costs. (Increasingly, physical products are sold\nboth online and in a physical channel.) As a startup you should pick the one\ndistribution channel that provides the optimum balance between the\ncompany’s value proposition, its costs and revenue model, and how\ncustomers prefer to buy. (You can add additional channels as you scale and\ngrow.)\nPick one distribution channel. You can add\nadditional channels as you scale and grow.\nDedicated e-commerce: Your company offers its products for sale directly\non your own “dedicated” e-commerce website (which can be hosted\nanywhere). Customers access the site via a web browser. Whether the product\nis physical or web/mobile, consumers and businesses can learn details, see\nproducts, compare features, and complete the transaction at the single URL.\nStrengths: Basic sites are easy to create, and deliver complete control of\nprice, product presentation, inventory and more.\nWeaknesses: Company must bear all challenges and costs of trafficbuilding and converting visitors to buyers.\nTwo-step e-distribution: This is how your company can reach many more\ncustomers by simultaneously selling your products on e-commerce sites that\nhelp generate awareness and demand. It is the most common web/mobile\nchannel, encompassing every conceivable retailer from Amazon.com\nBestBuy.com, the Android and Apple app stores to small e-commerce sites.\nDistribution costs vary, with Amazon.com at the high end, charging 55\npercent of retail prices to sell a physical book. For that hefty sum, this\nchannel maintains inventory, packs and ships the goods, and collects\npayment. As a rule, the more the retailer does to generate consumer demand,\nthe more it earns for making the sale.\nStrengths: Fastest way to get national distribution at a variable cost with\nlittle upfront spending.\nWeaknesses: Little control of on-site promotion or product visibility,\nexcept with extra spending.\nAggregators: The online equivalent of a physical shopping mall, usually in a\nsingle category. They aggregate consumers with common areas of interest\nand direct them through a web/mobile supermarket of products. Customers\naccess the site via a web browser. Hundreds of mortgages and related\nfinancial products are available through LendingTree.com, while\ncloudshowplace.com provides a buyer’s guide to hundreds of SAAS software\ntools, many of which can be purchased with a few clicks on the showplace.\nDiapers.com and Zappos (both owned by Amazon) aggregate baby and shoe\nproducts, respectively, from hundreds of manufacturers. Online trade shows\nfor business-to-business products work in a similar way, creating the look\nand feel of a typical trade show and selling booths to marketers who provide\ndemonstrations, white papers, and literature and can take orders in their\nvirtual “booths.”\nStrengths: Fast way to get national distribution at a variable cost with little\nupfront spending.\nWeaknesses: Hard to get visibility, on-site promotion and marketing; can\nbe very costly.\nPlatforms that Operate as Channels\nMobile-app commerce: A web/mobile application distribution platform\nbehaves in many ways just like a physical channel’s retail stores. Mobile apps\nand many web apps and games are sold on web/mobile platforms. For\nexample, Zynga’s Farmville and other online games use Facebook, with\nhundreds of millions of users, as a “platform.” Facebook offers its platform to\nthousands of other companies, turning its social network into a sales channel.\nApple and Google’s Android offer app stores that allow mobile users to buy\neverything from games to expense-account software for their iPhone or\nAndroid phones.\nDedicated marketplaces like the iPhone app store or the Android are the\nprimary “platform-as-channel” marketplace for smartphone app. The Apple\nApp Store charges 30 percent of retail pricing for downloadable iPhone\napplications. Smartphone apps dominated sales in this channel, but\nsalesforce.com opened its AppExchange for business-to-business applications\nand other companies will follow.\nStrengths: Massive reach in a fast-growing channel for games, software,\nshopping applications and more. It’s a channel that’s “always on” and\nquite handy (for literally many millions of consumers). This is an\nexplosive business opportunity.\nWeaknesses: Costly intermediaries, file-size constraints, productpresentation and payment challenges, operational complexity, extremely\ndifficult to get consumers’ attention or promote app or its marketing\nmessages.\nSocial commerce: Social networks like Facebook and Twitter have moved\nquickly to turn their platforms into commerce to monetize their vast\naudiences. Customers access the site via a browser or dedicated app.\nWeb/mobile currency and items for enhanced online gaming are already\nmaturing, with many more vertical markets following in its lucrative\nfootsteps.\nStrengths: Fast, potentially massive distribution; great for product\nlaunches, awareness-building, and fast cash.\nWeaknesses: Hard to create awareness and draw attention. Platforms take\n50 percent or more as a cost of sales.\nFlash sales: Flash sales offer a list of consumers deep discounts on branded\nmerchandise with offers expiring in 24 or 48 hours. Gilt.com, Groupon and\nscores of clones assemble massive e-mail and social networking lists of\nconsumers eager to obtain product discounts in specific categories or\ngeographies. These social-commerce sites deliver the revenue and a volume\nof customers.\nFlash sales can generate massive red ink in a hurry.\nStrengths: Fast, potentially massive distribution; great for product\nlaunches, awareness-building, and fast cash.\nWeaknesses: Often painfully expensive. End users often expect 50 percent\ndiscounts from retail price; manufacturer then pays 50 percent of its 50\npercent sales price to the social-commerce site. Can generate massive red\nink in a hurry.\nFree-to-paid channel: While it’s hard to say whether this is a platform, a\nchannel, or a demand-creation strategy, it’s an increasingly powerful way to\ncreate customer relationships, particularly among companies with\nweb/mobile products that require little or no customization. A few fastgrowing companies such as Zynga have used social networking to create vast\naudiences of free users of games like Farmville and MafiaWars. They provide\na certain amount of game play for free—sometimes even all of it—but sell\nlots of web/mobile goods for real cash as they “hook” their users on the\ngame.\nIf they don’t convert and pay, you’re dead.\nOther game companies offer free, limited versions widely or full\nversions for a limited time (“seven-day free trial with your credit card”) only\nto aggressively upsell free users to a more elaborate paid version. Recently,\nonline tax-software companies have begun offering free federal-tax-return\npreparation online for simple tax returns, only to create a channel from which\nthey can upsell people with more complex returns to prepare or charge them\nfor state and municipal returns.\nStrengths: Accelerates trial and adoption at relatively low cost. Terrific as\na launch strategy.\nWeaknesses: Free-to-pay is sexy but dangerous. You can get tons of users\nfast, but if they don’t convert and pay, you’re dead. Mapping profitable\nconversion of free to paid users makes or breaks the company.\nTests Can Help You Pick the Channel\nFor some products, the channel choice is obvious. There’s one channel for an\niPhone or iPad app, and another equally obvious channel for social games.\nMany products, however, will need to test both the cost-effectiveness and\nvolume potential of several channels to determine where to put their energy,\nfocus, and marketing dollars. A simple downloadable app, for example,\nmight simultaneously test as many as three channels: an app store, the\nfreemium model, and online retail. Design the test to spend roughly the same\namount of money on each one, and—at a bare minimum—look to generate at\nleast $2 in revenue if not more for every dollar spent on marketing (you can\nalways improve it later). Then see which program delivers customers at the\nlowest cost per customer, and which delivers the greatest absolute number of\ncustomers.\nMulti-Sided Markets Need Unique Channel Plans\nAt about the same time a physical channel company begins thinking about its\nsales channels, startups in multi-sided web/mobile markets should develop a\nhypothesis about their “other” side or, in this case, the “revenue channel.”\nMost multi-sided revenue channels function quite simply: they attract a\nlarge number of users and advertisers pay to reach them via textlinks, banner\nads, in-game visibility or traditional online advertising. So the goal now is\nrelatively straightforward, identify potential advertisers or agencies, and\nestimate how much they’re willing to pay, how the sales process works, and\nwhether the hypotheses about the revenue “side” of the market is valid.\nBeware the two deadliest advertising-related problems for multi-sided\nmarketers: small and indistinct audiences.\nThe more distinct the audience—and the harder it\nis to aggregate—the more valuable it will be.\nSmall audiences: Advertising agencies like to spend big piles of their\nclient’s money with as few insertion orders (the advertising equivalent of\na purchase order) as possible, and they want to reach massive numbers of\npeople with each one. Getting an insertion order or even the opportunity\nto make a sales pitch to an advertising agency generally requires monthly\npage views in the many millions. Make sure the “payer” channel’s\npotential is clear as part of the channel validation process.\nIndistinct audiences: The online advertising world is so littered with\nunsold inventory that many advertisers buy huge volumes of banners,\nskyscrapers and textlinks through online advertising “networks” that\naggregate dozens or hundreds of sites appealing to a specific group, such\nas teenagers. They collect all the unsold inventory at a very low,\ndistressed price and roll it into one package that often includes hundreds\nof millions of impressions for one or several advertisers.\nThe more distinct the audience—and the harder it is to aggregate—the\nmore valuable it will be. “Working mothers” and “generation Y”\nconsumers can be aggregated easily, for example, while very frequent\nfliers or luxury-car owners are harder to aggregate. Other high-value\naudiences: orthodontists, owners or renters of private aircraft, gamers\nwho spend more than $100 a month on gaming, and high-roller casino\ngamblers. The more distinctive a group, the more a multi-sided market\ncan charge the “other side” to reach the group with ads.\nChecklist 7: Channels\nGoal: Develop a hypothesis of your distribution channel\nReference: Chapter 3, Channel Hypotheses\nWhat channel will your users use to buy from you?\nDraw the Distribution Channel Diagram\nHow much will the channel cost (direct expenses or channel discounts)\nAre there indirect channel costs (presales support, promotional\ndollars...)\nWhat else is needed for customers to use/buy the product?\nHow do they acquire those pieces?\nWhat is the net revenue after channel costs?\nIs this a Multi-sided Market?\nHow will you address each side of the market?\nExit criteria:\nDistribution channel selected\nUpdate your business model canvas\nPass/Fail tests identified\nNote to reader: These following guidelines, geared for physical channel\nstartups, are invaluable to web/mobile startups as well.\nChannels Hypothesis (Physical)\nThe channel brief describes how the product gets from company to\ncustomers.\nThe difference between physical and web/mobile channels is dramatic.\nIn one, physical goods move from a loading dock to a customer or a retail\noutlet. In another, no human involvement is required, as the product is\noffered and sold online. (If the product itself is bits, it’s both sold and\ndelivered online.)\nPhysical channels have been around for centuries. They’re an\n“intermediate customer” the startup has to deal with, and the barriers can be\nsignificant: high cost, long lead times, lack of control, and lack of promotion,\nto name a few. However, the rewards can be great. In the 20\nth century,\nphysical distribution was especially important. Back then, the pinnacle of\ndistribution was to be sold at Walmart, which welcomes 20 million\nAmericans every day.\nConsider whether your product fits the channel.\nMost companies use both web/mobile and physical channels today. For\nexample, even with some 10,000 massive physical stores, Walmart also\ninvests heavily in walmart.com, an alternate channel, as most national\nretailers do. Most channel strategies, particularly for physical goods, today\ninvolve both physical and web/mobile channels. Whether a company uses a\nphysical or web channel, it must generate customer demand and drive it into\nthe sales channel. Physical and web channels employ very different demandcreation activities.\nConsider Whether Your Product “Fits” the\nChannel\nDifferent sales channels support different product price bands. For example, a\nsalesperson selling enterprise software needs to bring in more than $1.5\nmillion in annual revenue. On the other hand, few Smartphone applications\nsell for more than $10, minus the typical 30 percent app-store fee. Other etailers such as Amazon and bestbuy.com regularly sell products for hundreds\nif not thousands of dollars, sometimes keeping as much as half the gross\nrevenue for themselves.\nBe sure to factor all channel costs into the pricing hypothesis, since\nmany channels charge for distribution, promotion, and even sometimes for\nplacing products on the shelves or returning unsold merchandise to the\ncompany. Channel selection changes the company’s revenue model, often\ndramatically, so be sure to revisit and update the revenue stream hypothesis\nbased on the company’s costs and net revenue when making the channel\nselection. (Always compute the revenue stream on a “net” basis, reflecting\nonly revenue that will arrive in company coffers once the dust settles.)\nWhich Channel Should I Use?\nA tragic mistake many startups make is to overreach on initial channel\nefforts. Until the company completes customer validation, it should pick a\nsales channel representing the greatest potential and focus on it to the\nexclusion of all others. Your company is still testing and expanding its\nhypotheses and needs to focus on learning. Don’t try to launch a product via\ndirect sales, chain stores and direct mail all at once—it’s almost impossible to\nsucceed at all three. The big exception, of course: physical-channel launches\nwith simultaneous web-marketing (and sometimes sales) support.\nDecisions about channel and pricing are interrelated, so develop the\nchannel hypothesis while working simultaneously on the revenue and pricing\nhypothesis. For example, retail distribution cuts the company’s revenue\ndramatically while direct sales may deliver more sales dollars but do so more\nslowly. When considering which channels to adopt, keep these criteria in\nmind:\nAre there established buying habits/practices in the product category?\nDoes the channel strengthen the sales process? At what cost to the\ncompany?\nWhat are the price and complexity issues surrounding sale of the\nproduct?\nStartups seldom get the channel strategy right the first time. Most\ntechnology startups, for example, assume that a direct sales force is the way\nto go, a hypothesis that’s often proved wrong. It’s almost always smartest—\nand safest—to first observe existing buying patterns and habits for similar\nproducts and product categories, since customers are demonstrating their\npreferred channel by spending their money there.\nValue Proposition 2: Market-Type and Competitive\nHypothesis\nThe market-type brief describes which of the four market types the company\nfits into. (Refer to Chapter 1, Rule 7, in the Customer Development\nManifesto.) It also adds a competitive brief.\nRegardless of the channel they choose, startups adopt (or pursue) one of\nfour market types. The consequences of choosing the wrong market type are\nsevere (prematurely burning cash on marketing and sales before it’s needed),\nbut unlike decisions about product features, the market-type choice is a “latebinding” decision. While a final decision can be deferred until customer\ncreation, it’s wise to develop and test an initial market-type hypothesis while\nmoving through the customer discovery phase. In the next chapters, we’ll\ncome back to the market type selection process many times, and refine and\ndeepen the analysis after further discussing customers and market.\nIn this brief, seek a provisional answer to just one question: is the\ncompany entering an existing market, re-segmenting an existing market,\ncreating a new market or cloning a market?\nMarket type drives marketing spending, sales\ntiming and cash need.\nMarket Type\nFor some startups, the market-type choice is pretty clear. When entering a\nmarket that has a ton of competitors, whether it’s smartphones, social\nnetworks, glucose meters or airplanes, the choice has already been made for\nyou: it’s an existing market. On the other hand, if your company invents a\nnew class of product no one has ever seen before, it’s most likely in a new\nmarket. However, most companies have the luxury of choosing which market\ntype to use. So how to make the decision? A few simple questions begin the\nprocess:\nIs there an established, well-defined market with large numbers of\ncustomers? Do customers know the name of the market and do\ncompetitors exist? Does the product have an edge (better performance,\nfeatures, service) over competitors? If so, it’s an existing market\nWould some part of an existing market buy a product designed to\naddress its specific needs? Even if it cost more? Or even if it had worse\nperformance in an aspect of the product irrelevant to this niche? If so,\nthink re-segmented market/niche strategy\nAnother type of re-segmentation answers the question: Are there\ncustomers at the low end of an existing market who will buy “good\nenough” performance if they can get it at a substantially lower price? If\nyes, think re-segmented market/low-cost strategy\nWithout an established and well-defined market, there are obviously no\nexisting customers or competitors and a new market is being created\nStartups in Russia, India, Indonesia, Brazil, Japan and China (where\nthey have large local markets and language and cultural barriers) have\nan additional market type: the clone market. Can you adopt/borrow/copy\nan already-successful business model and company from the U.S. and\nadapt it to local language and buying preferences. (Not too long from\nnow, ideas from those countries will be cloned in the U.S.)\nWhen you talk to customers, they’ll have lots of opinions about where\nthe product fits. Don’t worry about wavering among the market-type choices.\nFor now, just look at each market type and pick the one that best fits the\ncompany’s vision today. Table 3.1 summarizes of the trade-offs.\nMarket Type Trade-Offs (Table 3.1)\nOne of the best tools for sorting out existing market entry strategies is\nderived from military operations research. It suggests a few simple rules that\ncompanies can use to analyze an existing market:\nIf a single company has 74 percent of the market, the market has\nbecome an effective monopoly. For a startup, that’s an unassailable\nposition for a head-on assault. (Think Google in search or Facebook in\nsocial networks.)\nIf the combined market share for the market leader and the secondranking company is greater than 74 percent and the first company is\nwithin 1.7 times the share of the second, it means a duopoly commands\nthe market. Its position is impervious to attack by a startup. (In the\ntelecom sector, Cisco’s and Juniper’s combined share of the core router\nmarket fits this description.)\nIf a company has 41 percent market share and at least 1.7 times the\nmarket share of the next-largest company, it’s the market leader.\nFor a startup, this too is a very difficult market to enter. Markets with a\nclear market leader offer an opportunity for re-segementation.\nIf the biggest player in a market has at least a 26 percent market share,\nthe market is unstable, with a strong possibility of abrupt shifts in the\ncompany rankings. Here there may be some existing market entry\nopportunities.\nIf the biggest player has less than 26 percent market share, it has no real\ninfluence on the market. Startups that want to enter an existing market\nfind these the easiest to penetrate.\nIf you decide to attack a market that has just one dominant player, you\nneed to be prepared to spend three times the combined sales and marketing\nbudget of that dominant player. (Ouch—so much for going head-on with\nGoogle or Facebook.)\nIn a market that has multiple participants, the cost of entry is lower, but\nyou still need to spend 1.7 times the combined sales and marketing budget of\nthe company you plan to attack. (To enter an existing market, you must steal\nmarket share from an incumbent, hence the war analogy.) Table 3.2\nsummarizes the existing market cost of entry.\nMarket Type—Cost of Entry (Table 3.2)\nCompetition in an Existing Market\nNow that you understand the type of market you’re in, the competitive\nlandscape becomes clearer. If you believe your company and product fit into\nan existing market, you need to understand how your product outperforms\nyour competitors’. In an existing market the customers can tell you what the\nbasis of competition is. It nearly always has to do with key product attributes,\nbut sometimes it’s other components of the business model—e.g., channel or\nprice. Strive for a product or feature or improvement that can get a customer\nto say, “I’ll pay anything for that.”\nPositioning the product against the slew of existing competitors is\naccomplished by adroitly selecting the basis of competition where you can\nwin. Remember it’s not always features. It can be convenience, services,\nbrand, etc., where the new entry is clearly better. Summarize the thinking in a\nbrief. When entering an existing market, good questions to address in the\nbrief include:\nWho are the incumbents and which ones drive the market?\nWhat is the market share of each competitor?\nHow many marketing and sales dollars will the market leaders spend to\ncompete?\nWhat will the cost of entry be against incumbent competitors?\nWhat performance attributes have customers said are important? How\ndo competitors define performance?\nWhat share of this market does the company want to capture in the first\nthree years?\nHow do the competitors define the market?\nAre there existing standards? If so, whose agenda is driving the\nstandards?\nDoes the company seek to embrace these standards, extend them, or\nreplace them? (If the answer is to extend or replace them, this may\nindicate a re-segmented market.) When you enter an existing market,\nthough, also fill out the competitive brief discussed later in this section\nto shape the positioning further\nOne way to plan your attack in an existing market is to refer to your\nbusiness model canvas. What jobs are your customers asking your product to\nfill? What problem is your value proposition solving?\nRe-segmenting an Existing Market\nIn an existing market, your startup is the weakest player with the least\nresources. Therefore, attacking the strongest players head-on is foolish. You\nwant to choose strategies that acknowledge your weaknesses and play to your\nagility. If there’s a dominant player with more than 74 percent market share,\ndon’t attack that market head-on. Why? Because you need three times the\nresources of the market leader. Instead, target your attack at the point where\nyour limited resources can make a difference. You’ll segment the existing\nmarket to create a submarket where your product can be unique or\nsubstantially different. Or if you can create a new market, you can define a\nspace the market leader doesn’t address at all.\nIf your enemy is superior in strength, evade him. If\nangry irritate him. Pretend to be weak, that he may\ngrow arrogant.\nIf the dominant player has between 26 percent and 74 percent market\nshare, pick your battles carefully. Remember the cost of a head-on attack:\nthree times the budget of a single competitor or 1.7 times that of a competitor\nin a crowded market.\nMost startups don’t have access to those financial resources. Therefore,\nre-segmenting the market or creating a new market is almost always the\ndefault when faced with a dominant incumbent. All the marketing tricks for\nnipping at the heels of an entrenched competitor can be used here. Most of\nthem were invented 2,500 years ago by Sun Tzu and described in his book\nThe Art of War. Paraphrasing about: “All warfare is based on deception. If\nyour enemy is superior evade him. If angry irritate him. If equally matched,\nfight, and if not, re-evaluate”.\nYour goal is to become No. 1 in something important to your customer.\nIt could be product attribute, territory, distribution chain/retailer, or customer\nbase. Keep segmenting the market (by age, income, region, etc.) and focusing\non the competitors’ weak points until you have a battle you can win.\nRemember, any company can take customers away from any other company\n—if it can define the battle. When re-segmenting an existing market,\npositioning rests on either:\n(a) finding a unique niche where some product feature or service\nredefines the market, creating a clear competitive advantage\n(b) being the “low-cost provider” or\n(c) combining differentiation and lower operating cost into a Blue Ocean\nStrategy that creates an uncontested market space and makes the\ncompetition irrelevant while creating and capturing new demand.\nSouthwest Airlines was among the first to re-segment air travel this\nway, followed by many copycat failures and much later by JetBlue.\nCirque du Soleil is an example of a Blue Ocean re-segmentation,\noffering product differentiation as well as lower operating costs\nIn an existing market, your startup is the weakest\nplayer with the least resources.\nWhen re-segmenting for a unique niche, address these questions in this brief:\nWhat existing markets are customers coming from?\nWhat are the unique characteristics of those customers?\nWhat compelling needs of those customers are unmet by existing\nsuppliers?\nWhat compelling product features will get customers to abandon their\ncurrent suppliers?\nWhy couldn’t existing companies offer the same thing?\nHow long will it take you to grow a market of sufficient size? What\nsize?\nHow will the company educate the market and create demand?\nGiven that no customers yet exist in the new segment, what are realistic\nsales forecasts?\nHow can this forecast be tested?\nCan parts of the business model be changed to differentiate the\ncompany?\nFor this type of startup, draw a “market map” (a diagram of how this\nnew market will look) as shown in Figure 3.9, to illustrate why the company\nis unique. Draw the market map with the startup in the center. A resegmented market assumes that customers flow from an existing market(s).\nDraw the existing markets that customers should flow from (remember that a\nmarket is a set of companies with common attributes). Draw the product\nfeatures and functions that, when assembled, best describe the new product\n(think Hershey bar, now with peanut butter and zero calories—each attribute\ndraws different customer groups).\nExample of a Market Map (Figure 3.9)\nWhen re-segmenting based on low cost, questions to address include:\nWhat existing markets are customers coming from?\nWhat are the unique characteristics of those customers?\nWhat price will it take (known as “switching cost”) to get those\ncustomers to spend time online with or buy from the new company?\nWhat features are customers willing to give up to get the lower price?\nHow can this hypothesis be tested quantitatively?\nFinally, visualize why thousands of new customers will believe in and\nmove to this market. And beware the “low-price provider” re-segmentation,\nsince competitors can reprice in a matter of days if not hours, eviscerating the\npositioning that everyone just bet the new business on.\nThe market map is particularly important for new web-based businesses.\nConsider how much time you expect consumers to spend on the site, whether\nfor personal accounting, online gaming or social networking. Then consider\nwhere the time will come from: will they abandon Site A or B, sleep less, or\ndo all their e-mail on the new social network? It’s a market map based on\nminutes, not dollars.\nWhere will the minutes come from, and how and why will they come to\nthe new company. For social networks, it’s the “Facebook question:” what\ncan people do on the new social network that they can’t or don’t already do\non Facebook, the market leader, and why will they do it elsewhere?\nIt’s the web/mobile equivalent of market share. Explain how and why\nconsumers will “trade in” time they currently spend elsewhere for time on the\nnew site. If a new online game won’t cut back on someone’s playtime with\nFarmville or Mafia Wars, where will he or she find the time to play an\nadditional new game? Figure it out and map the “time source.”\nWhat could be better than a market with no\ncompetitors?\nEntering a New Market\nWhat if there are no competitors? What if, after talking to all your early\ncustomers, you continue to hear, “There’s nothing else like what your\ncompany is offering”? What if, after looking at all the quantitative data, you\ncan’t find other companies with comparable products? Congratulations—\nyou’re creating a new market. At first glance, a new market has great appeal.\nA standing joke is that every new market has its own descriptive TLA (threeletter acronym). What could be better than a market with no competitors?\nAnd absence of competition typically means that pricing isn’t a competitive\nissue but an issue of what the market will bear. Wow, no competitors and\nhigh margins!\nA company creating a new market is a radically different type of\ncompany from one entering or reframing an existing market. While there are\nno market-share battles with competitors, there are also no existing\ncustomers. If there are no existing customers, even an infinite demandcreation budget at the point of product launch won’t garner market share.\nCreating a new market is about long-term customer education and adoption.\nNew-market entries are by far the most expensive demand-creation\nchallenges, particularly since the marketer can’t say “tastier than Yummies”\nor “faster than Porsche” or “cheaper than Brand X,” since no such\ncomparables exist. At the risk of sounding pedantic, creating a new market\nmeans a market doesn’t currently exist—there are no customers. When\nentering a new market, good questions to address include:\nWhat are the markets adjacent to the new one being created?\nWhat markets will potential customers come from?\nWhat’s the company’s vision and why will lots of people care?\nWhat “never could have been done before” will make customers\nuse/buy?\nHow long will it take to educate potential customers to grow a market of\nsufficient size? What size is that?\nHow will the company educate the market? How will it create demand?\nGiven that no customers yet exist, what are realistic sales forecasts for\nthe first three years?\nHow much financing will it take to soldier on while educating and\ngrowing the market?\nWhat will stop a well-heeled competitor from taking over the market\nonce the startup develops it? (This phenomenon is the source of the\nphrase “Pioneers are the ones with arrows in their backs.”)\nIs the product better-defined as one that will re-segment a market or\nenter an existing one?\nNew-market entries are by far the most expensive...\nCompanies compete in new markets not by besting other companies\nwith product features but by convincing a set of customers that the new\ncompany’s market vision is real and solves a real problem a different way. A\nfew classic examples: Snapple, Toyota Prius, Siebel, Groupon, and\nFacebook. However, who the users are, and the definition of the market itself\nare both clearly unknown. This brief defines the new market and its users\nwith the startup at the center.\nOne last thing to consider: startups creating new markets won’t create a\nmarket of sufficient size to generate a profit until three to seven years from\nproduct launch. This sobering piece of data is derived from looking at the\nresults of hundreds of high-tech startups of the last twenty years. While you\nmay be convinced your startup is the exception, the odds say that unless\nyou’re in a “bubble economy,” it takes time for new ideas and products to\ndiffuse and catch on. (A bubble economy is defined as a time of irrational\nexuberance in a market when all normal rules are repealed.)\nMarket type, in summary: Market type is one of the most important choices\nfounders need to make and agree on with investors, since it drives spending,\ntiming and competitive analysis. The choice doesn’t need to be made during\ncustomer discovery, but an initial hypothesis is needed. If investors are\nexpecting substantial revenue in Year One, thinking they’ve invested in an\nexisting-market company, the outcome is typically a new CEO. Market type\nselection drives spending and budget as well as revenue expectations.\nCompetitive Brief\nOnce you understand your market type, it’s relatively simple to assemble a\ncompetitive brief. This will help you understand how you’ll compete in the\nmarket.\nWhen entering an existing market or re-segmenting one, your first\ninstinct may be that the basis of competition is simply the product features of\nyour value proposition. That may be, but you may be missing a bigger\ncompetitive advantage. Is there something about partners, the channel,\nresources, etc. that would be a game changer? Think of Apple and the\noriginal iPod. It combined a hardware player, which lots of vendors had, with\nan easy-to-use software application, iTunes, which no one had (but others\ncould have built) and then added partners at the record labels (which required\nSteve Jobs’ reality-distortion field). The business model canvas is a perfect\nvehicle for brainstorming some of these ideas.\nIn a new market, it’s tempting to say,\n“We have no\ncompetition.” But you’ll be wrong.\nExplain how and why your new product is better than its competitors.\nOther items the competitive brief should consider:\nHow have existing competitors defined the basis of competition? Is it in\nterms of product attributes? Service? What are their claims? Features?\nWhat makes the new company and its product stand out as dramatically\ndifferent? Features? Performance? Price?\nWill customers care if the new product lets them do something they\ncouldn’t do before?\nIn a retail store, which competitive products will be shelved next to the\nnew entry?\nFor web/mobile apps, assess competitors’ product quality, features, sales\nor user data, and traffic levels.\nWhat’s strongest about each competitor’s product? What do current\ncustomers like most about those existing products? What would\ncustomers change about them?\nWhat is a customer’s “reason to buy” or use the product, app, or site?\nAnd which competitors will they abandon to do so, and why?\nIf you’re in a new market, it’s tempting to say, “We have no\ncompetition.” But you’ll be wrong. The new product itself may not yet exist,\nbut what do people do today without it? Do they simply not do something, or\ndo it badly or inefficiently? What will your new product enable them to do\nthat they couldn’t do before. Why will they care?\nIt’s only natural that startups compare themselves with other startups\naround them, but it’s important to remember a key tenet of Customer\nDevelopment: Don’t make a list of all competitors’ features to simply make a\nbigger list. A few incremental features or improvements seldom result in a\ngreat, scalable company. What’s more, in their first few years, startups\nseldom put one another out of business.\nWinners understand why customers buy.\nWhile startups compete for funding and technical resources, winners\nunderstand why customers buy. The losers never do. Competitive analysis\nstarts at why customers will buy and then looks at the whole market,\nincluding new and established competitors.\nChecklist 8: Market Type\nGoal: Select an initial Market Type\nReference: Chapter 3, Market Type\nDo you have a new product in an existing market?\nDo you want to clone an existing market?\nDo you need to redefine/reframe a market?\nOr do you want to create an entirely new market?\nIs your product/service a substitute for something customers already\nhave?\nIs it a replacement?\nIs it a variant on something already out there, but can be “respun” into\nsomething new?\nIs it something totally new?\nPositioning in An Existing Market\nDefine the basis of competition\nWho is driving the existing market?\nDo you have some advantage or appeal among any vertical or\nhorizontal market segment?\nPositioning in An Existing Market you Want to Resegment\nDefine the basis of the how you want to change the market\nWho is driving the existing market you want to resegment?\nPositioning in a New Market\nHow will you create the market\nEstimate of market creation costs\nExit criteria:\nA preliminary first hypothesis of the type of market\nUpdate your business model canvas\nPass/Fail tests identified\nCustomer Relationships Hypothesis\nThis customer relationships brief describes how you get customers to\nyour website or mobile app, keep them as customers and grow additional\nrevenue from them over time.\nThe “Get, Keep and Grow” Customers Funnel in Web/Mobile\n(Figure 3.10)\nPROCEED WITH CAUTION: This is not the time to broadly launch\nyour site or app to a wide audience. You are writing the briefs here, not\nimplementing tactics with your MVP!\nReview the previous section on customer relationships for physical\nproducts before starting this one. The web/mobile customer funnel in Figure\n3.10 is quite different from its physical counterpart in Figure 3.15. Getting\ncustomers here is simpler, having only two steps. It also includes a “viral\nloop” where early customers invite friends and colleagues to explore the new\nproduct. Finally, not visible in the diagram is the fact that web/mobile\nstartups can test tactics faster, market less expensively, and reach out to far\nmore customers than companies in the physical channel.\nThe test of “Get, Keep and Grow” activities during customer discovery\nis small-scale, exposing the “rough and dirty,” or low-fidelity, minimum\nviable product to a modest number of customers, perhaps a few hundred or\nso, to gauge their reaction to the business model (including value proposition,\nprice, and product features.) Discovery explores which tactics work and\ngauges initial reactions to the MVP.\nCustomer Relationship for Web/Mobile Channels (Table 3.3)\nThe right-hand column of Table 3.3 provides an overview of\nweb/mobile “Get, Keep and Grow” strategies and tactics. It focuses first on\ngetting customers, since the company first has to have customers before it can\nwork to keep them, sell them a second time, or grow them.\nMany web/mobile products operate as multi-sided markets; Google and\nFacebook are canonical examples. Consumers use the product at no cost.\nAdvertisers pay the company to reach those customers with ads, AdWords,\ntextlinks and other marketing messages. That revenue is why Google can\nafford to build massive data centers and offer search for “Free.”\nMulti-sided marketers need two separate, parallel “Get” approaches—\none for the users and another for the payers, since the value proposition for\neach is quite different. Almost universally, multi-sided marketers focus first\non efforts to get users. A company that has aggregated an audience of many\nmillions can almost certainly find marketers eager to pay for the privilege of\ncommunicating with that audience.\nGetting Customers: Acquisition and Activation\nDevelop the company’s hypothesis about how it will “Get” customers.\nThere are a million-plus apps for sale on mobile app stores and an\ninfinite number of commerce, social and content websites, so the mere fact\nthat you’ve launched a new one doesn’t make it a successful business.\nBuilding your product is the easy part. The hard part is getting customers to\nfind your app, site or product. It’s a daunting, never-ending challenge to build\ncustomer relationships, quite literally, one customer at a time.\nThe “Get Customers” Funnel in Web/Mobile Channels (Figure 3.11)\nBuilding your product is easy. The hard part is\nGetting Customers.\nAcquisition vs. Activation: What’s the Difference?\nLet’s get started with the first two steps for “getting” customers: acquisition\nand activation.\n“Get Customers” Tools for Web/Mobile Channels (Table 3.4a)\nCustomer Acquisition: The acquisition phase equates to the “awareness,”\n“interest,” and “consideration” steps in the physical channel, where\ncustomers learn about and explore a product before they buy. In web/mobile\napps, the “Get” effort focuses on bringing as many customers as possible to\nthe company’s online “front door”—the landing page. There, they’re\nintroduced to the product and hopefully buy it or use it. Since the number of\npeople who come to a landing page and look but don’t buy or use is often\nvery high, web/mobile “Get” plans must reach lots of people—for a\nconsumer website, that can be millions.\nCustomer Activation: This second step in the “Get” process is much like the\n“purchase” step in the physical channel. Here the customer shows interest\nthrough a free download or trial, a request for more information, or a\npurchase. A customer should be considered activated even if he doesn’t\npurchase or register, as long as the company has enough information to recontact him (whether by e-mail, phone, text, etc.) with explicit permission to\ndo so.\nOverview: How Customers Shop Online\nUnlike the door-to-door salesmen of yesteryear, your job on the web is to\n“pull” customers to you rather than to push your product at them. The web\noffers a near-limitless tool set to help you pull customers in.\nYour job on the web is to “pull” customers to you...\nYour first step in customer acquisition and activation is understanding how\npeople buy or engage with your product. Here’s how it happens:\nStep one: People discover a need or want to solve a problem. They say, “I\nwant to throw a party,” or feel lonely and decide to find a hot party or a\ndating site. Then what?\nStep two: They begin a search. Overwhelmingly, in this century, that search\nbegins online. It often happens at Google.com, but it can happen on\nFacebook, where they ask their friends, or on Quora, where they solicit\nopinions, or on hundreds of other special-interest “recommendation” sites\nfrom Yelp to Zagat to TripAdvisor.com.\nStep three: They don’t look very hard. People don’t just “find” you online,\nand in fact they often only pay attention to the first few things they uncover\n(how often do you search beyond the first page of results on Google?). You\nmust make your site, app or product as visible as humanly possible, in as\nmany of these places as possible where your customers are likely to begin the\nsearch. (The entire “Get” section ahead will guide you in doing just this.)\nStep four: They go where they’re invited, entertained or informed. You don’t\n“earn” interest from your customers with hard-boiled sales pitches or bland\ninformation. In a typical Google search, you’re one of many thousands of\noptions the customer can click on. So you have to earn that click by providing\ninviting, helpful or entertaining information in lots of formats (copy,\ndiagrams, white papers, blogs, videos, games, demos, you name it) and by\nparticipating in the communities and social media your customers are likely\nto be.\nDevelop your “Get Customers” Strategy\nMake your information as rich and inviting—and widely available—as\npossible and cast the widest-possible net when people begin their search.\nProvide helpful, non-sales-y information that leads them back to your\nproduct, app, or site. Then the selling process begins.\nUse the way people make decisions to guide your acquisition and activation\nstrategy:\n1. Determine who your audience is, then your goal is to be prominent\nwherever they spend time on the web. Skateboarders don’t read The\nWall Street Journal or TechCrunch very much, so focus on\nskateboarding sites, blogs and the like.\n2. What kind of content will they find attractive? Our skateboarders\nprobably prefer illustrations, games, and videos over long essays and\nwhite papers. Reach them with the kinds of content they’ll find most\ninteresting and helpful, such as tips on safer skateboarding or bolder\ntricks, not long essays on the finer points of boarding.\n3. Make sure your content works in the location. Quora, Twitter, and\nFacebook users expect short, interesting items and get bogged down\nwith or ignore long ones. Social networks don’t have much use for\nlengthy sales pitches. Be sure your content “fits” where you put it.\n4. Participate in the communities your customers are a part of. Answer\nquestions, provide feedback, offer tips, and gently invite people to\nexplore your product.\n5. Create content that people want to link to. Whether it’s helpful tips,\nFAQs, cartoons or fun videos, make your content the kind of content\nyour customers want to share with friends. The result extends your\ninvitation to those friends more often than not.\nCustomer Acquisition Tactics to Test\nThe best way to get this started is to put your initial acquisition test plan into\na spreadsheet outlining the activities, their costs, and each program’s goals.\nSee a sample acquisition-plan spreadsheet in the “Activate Plan” section of\nChapter 8. Acquisition begins by using free or earned web-media\nopportunities to acquire customers, since “free” is obviously the best cost.\nThe web offers many free crowd-sourcing or acquisition opportunities (SEO,\nsocial media, viral marketing, buzz and more).\nEarned or free acquisition tactics:\nPublic relations: Generate small “test” amounts of news and feature\ncoverage about the problem (not the product itself) on websites, blogs\nand social nets. Don’t publicize the product or solution until customer\nvalidation, it’s just too early. (Public relations doesn’t mean hire an\nexpensive outside agency. During customer discovery, you should be\nlearning this firsthand.)\nViral marketing: This often-confused term refers to three types of\nacquisition marketing, each used in different web/mobile channels. The\nthree are perhaps the most important customer acquisition tactics for\nweb/mobile marketers, because they’re all free or inexpensive to\nimplement. This is discussed in “grow” customers where viral activity\nencourages customers to refer others\nSearch engine optimization (SEO), an unpaid, or “natural,” search\noption, directs consumers to the product or service\nSocial networking encourages friends and early customers to blog about\na product or a company, use Facebook to “like” it, or use Twitter and\nother tools to broadcast personal recommendations\nAfter you get the free acquisition programs going, you should start to\ntest paid tactics.\nPaid acquisition tactics:\nIt’s hard to determine how much money to spend on acquisition tactics, in\npart because there are so many variables: how much funding you have, how\nconfident you are in your hypotheses, and how hard it is to find your\ncustomers are three of the key considerations. Obviously, free tactics are\nbetter than paid tactics when they deliver quality customers with strong LTV\nin sufficient numbers to create a great business. As a rule, however, life is\nseldom that easy, and you’ll need to test a blend of paid tactics along with a\nwider variety of free ones.\nHere are some of the most common web/mobile paid acquisition tactics you\nshould consider:\nPay-per-click (PPC) advertising: targetable, accountable paid search\nadvertising on Google and other search engines drives targeted traffic to\nthe company\nOnline or traditional media advertising: often used to introduce a new\nproduct or service\nAffiliate marketing: other related websites are paid to drive traffic to the\nproduct site or app.\nOnline lead generation: purchase of permission-based e-mail lists to\nsolicit interest (much trickier and more highly regulated for direct-tomobile-phone messaging)\nReview the list of “get” customers tactics from the physical channel to\nsee which ones warrant testing for your web/mobile startup. Candidates\ncertainly include advertising, direct mail, and everything from zany on-street\npromotions to blimps, billboards and more.\nSome quick and simple acquisition tests:\nIn Phase 2 of customer discovery you’ll run some small-scale acquisition\ntests with the free and paid tactics described above to test your understanding\nof the customer problem/need. In Phase 3 of customer discovery, you’ll again\nuse acquisition tools to gauge initial customer reaction to the MVP and\ndiscover whether the MVP is a compelling solution to the problem. These are\nlimited and targeted tests, not a product launch. Press releases make no sense\nhere, for example, since wide dissemination could either bring too many\ncustomers or create the false impression that the product is “launched” and\nfinished.\nYour Phase 2 & 3 acquisition tests should be limited to controllable,\ninexpensive, easily measured tactics like these:\n• Buy $500 worth of AdWords and see if they’ll drive customers\nrepresenting five or 10 times that amount in potential revenue to the\nsite or app and at least get them to register. Test at least two different\nheadlines and as many calls to action, carefully monitoring the\nperformance of each. Drop ineffective ones and refine the best\nViral marketing can’t start until there is a customer\nbase to viralize.\n• Use Facebook messages or Tweet to measurable audiences to invite at\nleast 1,000 people to explore the new product. Test several different\nmessages or invitations to be sure the messaging about the product is\nclear. If none of the messages delivers engagement or registrations,\nthe product or offer may well be the problem\n• Viral marketing: Getting customers can’t start until there’s a customer\nbase to viralize. There are several types of viral marketing, so review\nthe viral discussion in the previous section (and also here). Networkeffect businesses should consider viral activities sooner\n• Post referral banners using Commission Junction to get sites offering\nyour offer. Spend $1,000 in referral fees to relevant websites (usually\n$12 per referral). If the banners run and the money’s largely unspent,\nmove on\n• Buy an e-mail blast list of targeted customers for $500 or $1,000. Send\nat least two versions of the offer and expect to generate at least three\ntimes the potential revenue to at least sign up, if not a purchase\n• Traffic partners are another important source of users or customers that\nfuel the “Get” effort. These are typically contractual relationships\nwith other companies that provide predictable streams of customers or\nusers to your company while you provide either customers or fees to\nthe partner. This is so important to most web/mobile businesses that\nit’s addressed in its own “traffic partners” hypothesis\nWho’s Creating This Content?\nSuccessful web/mobile startup teams have a combination of skills: great\ntechnology skills (hacking/hardware/science), great hustling skills (to search\nfor the business model, customers and market), and great user-facing design.\nThe co-founder who’s the user-interface/design expertise owns content\ncreation. Ideally he or she is talented enough to create it without legions of\nhourly-rate agency folk around. Use guru.com and craigslist.com to find\ntalent, cost-effective freelancers with good references.\nCustomer Activation Tactics to Test:\nActivation is the second step in getting customers. As discussed earlier, this\nis where the customer either makes a purchase or, at a minimum, raises a\nhand and says, “I’m interested, contact me.” Activation could be an\nexploratory visit your website or free mobile app to see how a game is\nplayed, a comment posted on a blog or social network, or the use of a free\nsearch engine. At the other end of the spectrum, low-cost mobile apps and\nother products find transactions to be the best initial activation, since the\nproduct may be a free version or cost only 99 cents.\nActivation is the choke point... where customers\ndecide whether they want to participate, play or\npurchase.\nFor web/mobile businesses, activation is the choke point—the make-orbreak place where customers decide whether they want to participate, play, or\npurchase. Here, unlike the physical channel, the “product is the salesman,”\nencouraging visitors to explore, try, or read about the product on their own,\nwithout pressure or patter from a sales representative. Activation is always\nencouraged by a compelling value proposition, well-communicated and\ncoupled with a good, clear offer and a low-fidelity (in discovery) or hifidelity (in validation) MVP. Start by creating an activation-tactics plan in\nsimple spreadsheet form as in this example.\nMany startups falsely assume that because their customers are online,\nonline communication is all their customers want or expect. Very often, even\na single phone call can make a dramatic difference in acquisition and\nactivation rates. In some instances, as few as half the customers who discover\na product online will activate or buy without human-to-human contact. And\nthe presence of a phone number is known to communicate the company’s\nauthenticity. Just the presence of the company’s phone number—even if\nnever called—can increase its online click-through rate by five percent to 30\npercent. (When adding a phone number, be sure it’s answered promptly,\nknowledgeably, and effectively by someone with incentives to activate the\ncaller.)\nAcquisition and Activation in Web/Mobile Channels (Figure 3.12)\nSome quick activation tests:\n• Capture the customer’s e-mail address and get permission to follow up\nwith further information. Follow up with 1,000 customers and expect\nat least 50 or more to agree to activate\n• Offer incentives for activation: Offer a free trial, download, or white\npaper or a significant discount to 500 or 1,000 customers. Try this\nwith at least three different offers, hoping to find at least one that\ngenerates a 5 percent or greater response rate. Keep testing until you\ndo, and then calculate the revenue model based on response rates, and\ncosts\n• Call 100 prospects who don’t activate immediately. See if the phone\ncalls generate enough of a response-rate improvement to warrant the\ncost. Three times the response rate is probably needed\n• Free-to-paid conversion: Offer a seven- or 14-day free trial of an app,\nservice, or web/mobile product. Then compare the total 60-day\nacquisition revenue with the Get results of the typical paid offer. Or\noffer the use of some but not all of the site or app’s features.\neHarmony.com, for example, lets people find their ideal matches for\nfree but requires paid enrollment to tell your dream date that you’ve\ndiscovered him or her\nEven a single phone call can make a dramatic\ndifference in acquisition and activation rates.\n• Use free-download websites to offer free downloads or trials. Make\nsure the revenue generated over a 90-day period exceeds that of the\nstandard activation offer\nMonitor the results of all tests and, when you’re not satisfied (or it fails\nyour pass/fail test) revise the program and test again.\nKeeping Customers (Customer Retention)\nThe “Keep Customers” Funnel in Web/Mobile Channels (Figure 3.13)\nKeeping customers in the web/mobile channels has the same goal as\nretention efforts in the physical world: to minimize customer churn/attrition\nby providing great products and services, and interacting with customers\noften. (At this point in customer discovery, there aren’t customers to retain,\nso identify retention programs to test in the future.) Retention is done more\neasily online, where companies have the incredible power and ability to track\nand monitor every single prospect’s or customer’s individual behavior or lack\nof behavior (without violating their privacy).\n“Keep Customers” Tools in Web/Mobile Channels (Table 3.4b)\nLoyalty and points programs and other tactics borrowed from the\nphysical channel can also play a significant role here, as can elegant\npersonalized customer service and support, conducted digitally as much as\npossible. Strong digital help tools, FAQs, user blogs, clubs, and newsletters\nhelp with retention as well.\nCustomer Retention Strategy\nRetention programs live or die by a close monitoring of customer behavior to\nlearn who’s staying and who’s leaving and why. It’s critical to instrument the\nproduct not in order to track everything but in order to follow the most\nimportant customer behaviors you want to improve.\nFor example:\nTrack start dates and sources of each customer (referred by a blogger,\nanother site, etc.)\nTrack customers’ activity level individually. How often do they come?\nHow long is each visit? What’s the time span between visits?\nWhen do customers abandon, and what were they doing that caused\nthem to do so?\nMonitor customers’ behavior on-site: what do they click on, what don’t\nthey click on?\nTrack customer referrals to others and the sources and activity level of\nreferred visitors\nTrack the results of each promotion, whether outbound or on the site\nitself\nPROCEED WITH CAUTION: Remember, this is an\noverview/tutorial. There’s no way you can implement all this or even\nprocess this in one sitting.\nKeep the following guidelines in mind as you test:\nE-mail is easy to ignore and at times feels like spam, so be careful about\noverly relying on it. At least four of five e-mails are never opened, and\nconsumers often unsubscribe from self-serving marketing e-mails\nConsumers often resent “faux” personalization. People appreciate\nlegitimate, helpful personalization if they’ve opted in for example\n(“Here are the sneakers we have in your size, 11D” is far better than\n“Great buys for Bob”)\nDon’t get lazy and make automated marketing and e-mail programs your\nonly customer-retention efforts. Focus on great product, product\nenchancements, terrific service and other core retention initiatives\nEmbrace social networks as points of retention. Use them to keep\nvisibility high and to invite customers and friends back often\nThe key for retention for web/mobile channels is that the data customers\nhave given you make personalized retention efforts easy. But you need to\ncollect it. Observe each customer’s behavior and interact with customers\nbased on what they do or don’t do.\nTrack the behavior of each customer individually. Use that data to create\na personal one-to-one relationship that guides him to the next steps the\ncompany wants him to take. (But always respect personal-data privacy.)\nRetention programs live or die by a close\nmonitoring of customer behavior.\nSimple Retention Tests to Consider:\nThe hypothesis should include some core initial retention efforts that will be\ndiscussed during discovery and tested on a modest scale later, during\ncustomer validation. Be sure to include digital versions of relevant programs\noutlined in the physical section. Some specific tactics to test:\n• Outreach programs, including welcome e-mails, how-to guides, and\nphone calls thanking the user for coming aboard and offering simple\ntips on how to get more out of the product. Consider retention e-mails\nlike these:\nWe haven’t seen you visit in two weeks. Is everything OK?\nI’ve noticed you’ve had a few problems. How can we help?\nHave you seen some of the new features on our site?\nHere are five “power user” ideas for getting more out of your time\nat XYZ.com\n• Blogs, RSS and news feeds to further engage customers or users with\nthe product or site\n• Loyalty programs that encourage and reward repeat visits, purchases, or\nreferrals borrowed from the physical channel\n• Contests and special events: webinars, special guests, new features, and\nother reasons for current customers to come back\n• Mobile app push notifications: iOS/Android gives developers the\nability to push messages to users even when the app is closed. For app\ndevelopers, getting this right is critical to retention and customer\nengagement\n• Product updates and enhancements to the actual product itself always\ndrive loyalty and retention (and communicating them to customers\nhelps)\nGetting new customers is painful and costly, so\nkeeping those already on the roster is easier and\nmore cost-effective.\n• Placing live phone calls to users several weeks or (if annual) a month\nor more before contract renewal is a good option if you have a\nsubscription revenue model. Make them friendly, service-oriented\ncalls, but always listen for signs of potential churn and be ready with\na deal, discount or offer to save the customer. Remember: getting new\ncustomers is painful and costly, so keeping those already on the roster\nis easier and more cost-effective\n• Tips-and-tricks newsletters, time-triggered e-mails every seven or 14\ndays based on users’ on-site behavior or lack of visits\n• Personalized customer service and support, conducted digitally as\nmuch as possible. Strong digital help tools, FAQs, user blogs, clubs,\nand newsletters help with retention as well\n• Customer lock-in/high switching costs: If it’s relatively easy for your\ncustomer to switch from your products to your competitors’ (in an\nexisting market) you’ll probably have a higher churn rate. You may\nwant to consider tactics to “lock in” your customer to your product or\nsolution (through unique technology, data that can’t be transferred—\nthink Facebook and LinkedIn—or high startup costs with a new\nvendor.)\nMonitor Specific Retention Metrics\nMonitor and act on at least these basic retention metrics:\nsigns of dwindling visits, page views or time spent on the site or app\nincreased time between visits\naverage customer life (how long they stay active) and, if possible later,\nlifetime value\nincreases in complaints, help or support tickets\nreduced response rates or open rates on company e-mails\nOrganize the metrics around “cohorts,” or common groups of customers\n(like “those who joined in January”), since, for example, three-month\ncustomers may behave one way while nine-month customers may be much\nmore or less active than their newer brethren. (This is addressed in detail in\nthe retention-optimization discussion in Chapter 9.)\nGrowing Customers (New Revenue and Referrals)\nThe “Grow Customers” Funnel in Web/Mobile Channels\n(Figure 3.14)\nThere are two ways to grow existing customers: get current customers to\nspend more money or encourage them to send more customers to the\ncompany. These programs are detailed in Chapter 9 (Optimize Getting More\nCustomers). By then your company should have a sizeable number of\ncustomers to grow!\nPROCEED WITH CAUTION: Remember, this is an\noverview/tutorial. There’s no way you can implement all this or even\nprocess this in one sitting.\n“Grow Customers” Tools for Web/Mobile Channels (Table 3.4c)\n1. Get Current Customers to Spend More\nGetting current customers to buy more starts by making sure they’re satisfied\nwith the product, performance and price. Then you try to sell them more\nproduct, upgrade their service, or extend their contracts. These activities are\nimportant for the long-term, so test at least a few during customer validation.\nSome of the basic approaches to Grow Customers include:\nCross-sell programs that encourage buyers of a product to buy adjacent\nproducts. Getting buyers of toner cartridges, for example—to buy paper,\npencils, and other office products\nUp-selling programs that promote the purchase of “more” of higher-end\nproducts. For example, buying cases of toner rather than single\ncartridges, or the purchase of copiers, fax machines and other office\nmachines along with the toner\nNext-selling programs that concentrate on the next order: can the\ncompany encourage a long-term toner contract, sell the customer\nenvelopes to put the copies in, or become his primary office-products\nsupplier? These basic customer growth strategies work in consumer\ngoods as well as business-to-business\nUnbundling, which sometimes grows revenue. If a product is complex\nor multi-featured, split it into several products, each sold separately.\nThis works well in many tech, software, and industrial product areas\nFor now, develop a hypothesis about how the company will grow its\ncustomers, and test those ideas with—who else?—customers.\nSome simple “grow” programs to consider:\nEvery “thank you” or confirmation page should suggest multiple items\nthe customer may also find interesting, and ideally provide an incentive\nfor doing so\nNew items, special offers, and discounts for increasing the order size\nshould be prominent and integrated with the checkout process for high\nvisibility\ne-commerece companies should have “recommendation engines.” “If\nyou bought X, you’ll love Y”\ne-commerce companies should include special offers and discounts in\neach shipment\ne-mail customers to introduce new and different products or “add-on”\nfeatures to buy\nPromote special sales and offers on new products or services the\ncustomer hasn’t bought\nCustomer referrals are the most common type of viral marketing,\nalthough they obviously can’t begin until you actually have customers\n(so it’s discussed in the “Grow” section). Viral marketing stimulates\nreferrals of customers from other happy customers. Generate attention\namong the largest audience possible. Consider tools like YouTube and\nconferences you can attend and perhaps speak or promote at. Encourage\nfriends of the company and its team to invite their friends to learn more.\nConsider contests, sweepstakes and promotions to drive the reach of\nviral efforts\nViral products help sell themselves. Hotmail, Gmail, Facebook and\nmany other web products end every customer communication by saying,\n“Invite a friend to use our service.” When used, it’s powerful and\nvirtually free viral marketing\nNetwork-effect virality boosts usage of products like Skype,\nPhotobucket, and even fax machines. You can’t talk via Skype with a\nfriend who doesn’t have it or fax someone without a fax machine, so\ncustomers encourage others to join, expanding the network for their own\nbenefit. In the process, they get new users for the company\nCustomer referrals are the most “honest” source of\nnew business...\n2. Get Customers to Send More Customers to the\nCompany\nThere are lots of different viral marketing tools and tactics that help you get\ncustomers to refer other customers to the company. Here are the six most\npowerful viral marketing techniques to consider:\nEncourage customers to “like” the product on Facebook\nOffer customers discounts or free trial offers to share with friends\nEnable customers to e-mail their friends using their address books to\ncreate mailing lists\nCreate contests or incentives to encourage Tweeting, “liking” and other\nviral activities\nHighlight social-networking action buttons on the site to make viral\nefforts easy\nEncourage bloggers to write about the product, and reward them for\ndoing so\n(The customer relationship hypotheses should also address how the\n“Get, Keep and Grow” programs will be optimized once they’re under way.\nFor guidance in these areas, see Optimizaton Plans/Tools.)\nChecklist 9: Customer Relationships\nGoal: How you’ll “Get, Keep and Grow” Customers in a web/mobile channel\nReference: Chapter 3, Customer Relationships\nDraw Your “Get/Keep/Grow” Funnel\nDescribe your “Get Customers” Strategy\nAcquire\nActivate\nWhat are your “Get Customers” Tactics?\nSearch (SEM/SEO)\nViral\nPR\nTrials\nDescribe your “Keep Customers” Strategy\nInteract\nRetain\nWhat are your “Keep Customers” Tactics?\nCustomization?\nUser groups?

In this hypothesis we’ll focus on the\ncolumn on the left: the physical channel.\nEvery company, whether its product or channel is physical or\nweb/mobile, can summarize its mission in three succinct phrases: build great\nproducts; “get, keep, and grow” customers; and make money directly or\nindirectly from these customers. Customer relationships are the strategies and\ntactics to get, keep and grow customers.\nGetting customers, sometimes called demand creation, drives customers\ninto your chosen sales channel(s).\nKeeping customers, or retention, gives customers reasons to stick with\nthe company and product.\nGrowing customers involves selling them more of what they’ve bought\nas well as new and different products and encourages them to refer new\ncustomers.\n“Get, Keep and Grow” are among the most\nimportant hypotheses for any startup.\n“Get, keep and grow” are among the most important hypotheses for any\nstartup. You will die without customers and these are most expensive parts of\nany company. The diagram in Figure 3.15 provides an overview of the entire\ncustomer relationship life cycle. This hypothesis will “dissect” the diagram,\nstarting on the left from “awareness,” the first step, and proceeding through\neach of the many steps in the “get, keep, grow” process.\nPROCEED WITH CAUTION: There is no way you can implement all\nthis or even process it in one sitting. What follows is an overview of all\nthe things you need to consider as you shape a marketing strategy that’s\nbest for your startup.\nDeveloping Customer Relationships in the Physical\nChannel\nCustomer Relationship Tools for Physical Channels (Table 3.5)\nThink of the “get customers” process as a “funnel” in which the greatest\nnumber of potential customers—those on the left—have awareness of the\nproduct. The number of potential customers declines as their interest grows,\nas they consider buying, and then as they make the actual purchase. During\ncustomer discovery, you’ll launch a series of small-scale, inexpensive “get\ncustomers” experiments to determine the tactics that move customers into and\nthrough the funnel in a repeatable, scalable, and cost-effective way. Later,\nonce you have customers, you’ll begin customer retention activities to keep\nthe customers and use upselling, cross-selling and customer referral programs\nto grow the number of customers and the revenue.\n“Get Customers”\nGetting customers, or demand creation, has four distinct stages in the\nphysical channel: awareness, interest, consideration, and purchase. See\nFigure 3.16.\nThe “Get Customers” Funnel for Physical Goods (Figure 3.16)\nPROCEED WITH CAUTION: There is no way you can implement all\nthese alternatives at once or even process them in one sitting. What\nfollows is an overview of all the things you need to consider as you\nshape a marketing strategy that’s best for you.\nAwareness lets potential customers know about your product or service\n(think TV commercials shouting “new airline” or radio ads saying, “Now you\ncan fly cheaper”). It gets people thinking about the product or service.\nInterest means the message is no longer being ignored even if the\nprospect isn’t ready to act. Think of people saying, “I should try one of those\nlow-cost airlines sometime,” as a result of the initial awareness effort. One\nmore push could move this prospect to the consideration step.\nConsideration follows interest when the message is powerful enough or\ncontains a convincing offer that might lead to the thought, “Why don’t I take\nJetBlue on my trip to Florida next month?” Consideration may take the form\nof a free trial where it’s offered.\nPurchase follows consideration. It’s clearly the desired result of “get”\nactivities.\nCreating demand for a consumer electronics product sold on Walmart’s\nshelves is different from opening a chain of pizza parlors or selling a new\ntype of semiconductor. And while the description of customer relationship\nactivities may seem simple at first, it’s actually the result of a complex\ninterplay among customers, the sales channel, the value proposition and the\nbudget for marketing activities. When you get it right, it all comes together in\na repeatable, scalable, profitable business model.\nDevelop Your “Get Customers” Strategy\nEarned and Paid Media Feeding the “Get Customers” Funnel\n(Figure 3.17)\nThe first three funnel stages—awareness, interest, and consideration—happen\nin the consumer’s mind, out of reach of anything other than your advertising\nmessages. The first two stages—awareness and interest—are out of your\ncontrol until the customer identifies herself or himself to some channel like a\nretailer, a direct-sales rep, or a website and says, “I’m interested.” (This could\nhappen when the customer leaves a business card at a trade show, requests\nmore information online, or talks with a company representative.) The “get\ncustomers” activity moves customers as far into the funnel as possible until\nthe customer self-identifies and the channel takes over the “consideration”\nand “purchase” activity. But it all starts with awareness.\n“Get Customers” Tools for Physical Channels (Table 3.5a)\nAn important caution: be aware of the way the physical-channel has\nchanged in the past decade. Whether a product is sold at a car dealership, a\ngravel pit, a 7-Eleven or the trendiest retail boutique, 21st-century consumers\nbegin their search for products online. So online marketing is every bit as\nimportant to marketers in the physical channel as it is to their web\ncounterparts. Your job as a marketer is to be sure customers can easily find\nyour product or service on the web. This means that physical-channel\nmarketers need to pay almost as much attention to the next section of this\nchapter—“Web/Mobile Customer Relationships”—as they pay to this one.\n(For best results, read both sections before beginning the tasks outlined\nhere.) Marketers in the physical channel must embrace basic web-marketing\ntactics at every opportunity—websites, AdWords, online advertising—even\nin the unlikely event that your product isn’t for sale online. Online, your job\nis to “pull” customers to your product so they can discover it online, even if\nthey then buy it at your warehouse, at Walmart or face-to-face from a sales\nrepresentative.\nAwareness, interest, and consideration in the physical channel are\nprimarily driven by two types of communication tactics: earned (or free)\nmedia and paid media.\nEarned media is the free exposure a company generates. In the physical\nchannel, it includes press releases, product reviews, editorial features and a\nrange of “guerrilla marketing” tactics such as handing out fliers at trade\nshows where the company doesn’t buy a booth. These tactics are often\nfavored by startups because they’re far less expensive than paid media\nefforts. Many consumer products find their first customers through free\nsample or trial programs or by handing out samples or discount coupons on\nstreet corners.\nThe downside of earned media: unlike paid media, which run on specific\ndates and locations, editorial coverage is unpredictable and runs—or doesn’t\n—as editorial space or the product’s news value allow.\nOnline marketing is every bit as important to\nmarketers in the physical channel as it is to their\nweb counterparts.\nPaid media is exactly what it sounds like: media exposure that’s\npurchased on TV, blimps, direct mail or the web. This kind of activity can\ncost literally millions of dollars when rolled out, so customer discovery\nemploys small-scale tests to see which tactic will deliver the best results later,\nat product launch.\nOther paid-media awareness-creation tactics that aren’t free include\nadvertising, trade shows, direct mail, catalogs, events, telemarketing, and instore promotion. Most physical-channel marketers also promote their\nproducts online, of course. During customer discovery your spending will be\nlow until you successfully test a tactic and prove that it generates leads and\nsales cost-effectively.\nSimple “Get Customer” Tactics to Consider\nBuild a “get customers”-hypothesis spending spreadsheet that lists:\nthe free and paid media programs\nwhat the company hopes to achieve and at what cost\nBefore conducting these or any other tests of customer-relationship\ntactics:\n1. Create a “pass/fail” metric for each “Get” test that defines whether it\nworked and should be expanded. An example: will we get one sales\ncall for every 30 phone calls made to prospects?\n2. Consider a methodology for improving the results of each test, such as:\nIf the call blitz doesn’t work, we will e-mail first and then call each\nprospect twice.\n3. Be sure the tests are objectively measurable so that the big spending\ndecisions that follow aren’t made based on the fact that “it felt good”\nor “seems to work well.” JetBlue’s metric for radio ads might seek to\ngenerate reservations-hotline calls at a cost of $1 each. The logic: they\ncan spend $3 on marketing (sometimes called customer acquisition\ncost) to sell a round-trip ticket, and one caller in three buys a ticket on\naverage.\n4. Don’t forget that people buy from people. Create, don’t avoid,\nopportunities to talk via phone or in person with potential customers.\nThere are few more powerful sales tools!\nMost companies selling through the physical\nchannel will use a variety of web/mobile marketing\ntactics...\n5. Remember that most companies selling through the physical channel\nstill use a variety of web/mobile marketing tactics to gain awareness\nand sales for their products, so be sure to include elements of\nweb/mobile “Get” programs from the next section.\nThe sample spreadsheet in Figure 3.17 charts the costs and expected\nresults of the “get” efforts for a startup’s new heavy-duty, $2,500 printer sold\nto businesses through office-products stores. The spreadsheet is used to be\nsure the program tests are affordable.\nSample Customer Relationship Program Spreadsheet\nEarned Media\nPaid media\nProgram goals 50 sales plus 60 inquiries, 10% of the inquiries convert\nTotal 56 sales, 54 prospects\nTotal cost/sale = $140.00 (8700/56) vs. profit/sale of $300.00\n√ This is a good test\nSample Customer Relationship “Tactics to Test” Hypothesis\n(Figure 3.17)\n“Keep Customers”\nAs the “Get” customers exercise clearly illustrates, getting a new customer is\nan expensive process. Thus it’s important to think now about how the\ncompany will keep, or retain, customers it’s worked so hard to get. When\ncustomers cancel a subscription, never return to a supermarket, or close a\ncorporate purchasing account, it’s called “churn” or “attrition” (the opposite\nof retention!).\nThe “Keep Customers” Funnel (Figure 3.18)\nDevelop Your “Keep Customers” Strategy\n“Keep Customers” Tools for Physical Channels (Table 3.5b)\nFor any customer retention strategy to work, first the company must\ndeliver on all its promises that got the customers to buy in the first place.\nCustomers need to love the product or service, and every customer-facing\naspect of the business model has to perform exceptionally, from customer\nservice and support to complaint-handling, delivery, billing, and more. First,\na steady stream of product upgrades and enhancements should always keep\nthe product ahead of competition. By their nature, these are core-valuecreation activities and should be addressed in the value proposition\nhypothesis.\nNext, begin to think about programs that reach out to customers\nproactively to strengthen or bolster retention. This can be as simple as placing\n(often quite powerful) outbound calls to be sure customers are happy or as\ncomplex as a multi-tiered loyalty-points program to reward repeat purchases.\nIn a startup’s early days, it’s hard to test the impact of loyalty programs, since\nthe results need to be measured over long periods of time.\nIn a startup’s early days, it’s hard to test the impact\nof loyalty programs...\nIn addition, consider loyalty programs such as points, rewards and\ndiscounts as well as long-term retention incentives like multi-year contracts.\nMake them part of the hypothesis, and test them where possible during\ncustomer validation.\nFinally, consider other parts of the business model canvas. Are there\nthings your partners can do to help you keep customers? Other resources you\ncan use?\nSimple “Keep Customers” Tactics to Consider: During customer\ndiscovery, put together plans and then test some basic, inexpensive “Keep”\nactivities to see how they perform. Use the test results to guide future plans in\ncustomer validation and creation. Some simple programs to test and consider:\nLoyalty programs: How you will use loyalty programs to retain\ncustomers. Read more about loyalty programs in the customer validation\nsection and address them in this hypothesis.\nCustomer check-in calls: Put together a plan to call every customer, or\nevery fifth customer, once a month or once a quarter simply to thank\nthem for their business and see how they like the product. While you\nhave them on the phone, probe for questions they have about the\nproduct, features or functions. (By the way, e-mail is still a poor\nsubstitute for a voice or Skype connection.) Over time, target at least a\n15 percent improvement in repeat sales or renewals from customers\nwho’ve talked.\nLaunch a customer-satisfaction survey: Whether on the web or by mail\nor e-mail, plan to check with customers about their use of and\nsatisfaction with the product or service. (Probe for complaints or lack of\nuse, and reach out to any who express problems. Look for at least a 15\npercent reduction in churn from those who’ve been contacted.)\nSend product-update bulletins: Create simple tip sheets or user notes on\nhow customers are making the most of the product. (Send them to all\nusers, and offer a prize for users whose tips are published later. This is\ndifficult to measure precisely but inexpensive to implement.)\nMonitor customer-service issues: Customers who complain frequently\nare most likely to churn. (Get proactive with these customers, fix their\nproblems, and make them happy. Far fewer complainers should leave if\nthey’ve had their problems addressed.)\nCustomer lock-in/high switching costs: If it’s relatively easy for your\ncustomer to switch from your products to your competitors’, you’ll\nprobably have a higher churn rate. You may want to consider tactics for\n“locking in” customers to your product or solution (through long-term\ncontracts, unique technology, or data that can’t be easily transferred).\nIt’s 5-10x cheaper to keep a customer than to\nacquire one.\nLonger-Term Customer Retention: Customer retention is effective only\nwhen the customers self-identify so they can be contacted by the salesperson,\nchannel partner, or company representative charged with keeping them happy\nand coming back to buy more. As you learn more about individual customers\nover time, retention becomes increasingly individualized and targeted based\non the observed and measured customer behavior. This subject is more fully\naddressed during customer validation, when there are more customers to\nthink about keeping.\nSpecific retention metrics to monitor and act on include:\npurchase patterns: volume, frequency, slowdowns or halts\nparticipation in “grow customers” programs (described in the next\nsection)\nnumber of complaints to customer service, refund requests, problems,\nand the like\nparticipation, activity levels, redemptions in loyalty and incentive\nprograms\nRetention programs live or die by a close monitoring of customer\nbehavior to learn who’s staying and who’s leaving and why. You’ll organize\nthe metrics around “cohorts,” or common groups of customers (such as “new\ncustomers signed in January”). Three-month customers, for example, may\nbehave one way while nine-month customers may be more or less active than\ntheir newer brethren. (This is addressed in detail in the retention-optimization\ndiscussion.)\n“Grow Customers”\nOnce a company has a customer, why not sell them more, since it costs less\nthan acquiring new customers? Most startups think only about the revenue\nthey receive in their first sale to a customer, but smart companies think about\nthe revenue they can get over the lifetime of the relationship they have with a\ncustomer. Measuring customer lifetime value can be important when\ncomputing a startup’s potential. Describe how the company will get more\nrevenue from its existing customer base with programs that sell more and\nencourage customers to refer new ones to the company.\nThe “Grow Customers” Funnel (Figure 3.20)\nDevelop a “Grow Customers” Strategy\n“Grow Customers” Tools for Physical Channels (Table 3.5c)\nYour “Grow” strategy will have two key components: get the customers you\nhave to buy more, and get them to refer other customers to you. A few\n“Grow” tactics only work in the physical channel, such as:\n“Upsell” offers such as “spend $25 more and get free shipping”\nIn-pack promotional mailers of offers, coupons, and samples\nSpecials or premiums only available to customers who meet with a sales\nrep\nDirect mail is also an effective customer growth tool, of course.\nIncreasingly, however, physical channel marketers are turning to online\nmarketing rather than postal mail because of its speed, lower cost, and the\nability to target better. You should also study the discussion of “Grow”\nstrategy and tactics in the web/mobile section for many more ideas. This will\nhelp you shape your initial programs to grow your customer base through\nadditional sales and referrals.\nIt’s difficult at this time to think through and test extensive “Grow”\ncustomers programs because you have very few customers to test them with.\nFar more detail is provided in the customer validation step, when there are\nenough customers aboard your “Grow” programs.\nKey Resources Hypothesis\nThis brief identifies external resources critical to the company’s success and\nhow you’ll find and secure them.\nKey resources fall into four main categories: physical, financial, human\nand intellectual property. In each relevant category, create a list of the key\nresources you’ll require, what you expect to pay, and where you’ll go to find\nthem.\nPhysical resources: These fall into two types: company facilities and\nproduct/service resources. Examples of company facilities are office space\nand company location (near mass transit to more easily attract lots of\nemployees, in a city with great restaurants, etc.). Product/services may\ninclude a steady supply of superthin silicon wafers or iron ore or thousands of\nfeet of warehouse space or specialized lab or manufacturing space. Many\nresources are capital-intensive, particularly where physical goods are\nconcerned—manufacturing equipment, raw materials, and the like.\n...many of the capital-intensive resources have\nbecome utilities or can be outsourced.\nIn the 21\nst century, many of the capital-intensive equipment or services\nresources companies used to need to physically own and pay for have\nbecome utilities or can be outsourced. For example, startups that need\ncomputing and server capacity can buy processing power and storage, in the\ncloud, from Amazon.com and many others (slashing the cost of a software\nstartup by a factor of 10 or more). Manufacturing that used to be a capitalintensive is now outsourced to Asia (with an equally significant reduction in\ncost). IT and services can be done cheaper in India, etc.\nFinancial resources: Money is the lifeblood of startups. You stay in business\nuntil you run out of it. This book is about how to reduce startup infant\nmortality by making everything you do less wasteful and more cash-efficient.\nThere are tons of articles, websites and entire books on how to raise\nmoney for a startup—and whom to raise it from. Friends and family, crowd\nfunding, angels, venture capital and corporate partners are the usual suspects.\nBut don’t overlook government grants as an alternative funding source for\nnew ventures. In the U.S., the grants.gov website is the first stop for a number\nof sources such as SBA (Small Business Administration) and SBIR (Small\nBusiness Innovation Research) grants.\nCompanies selling physical products have additional sources of capital:\nEquipment lease line. This lets you finance the entire purchase price of\nbusiness equipment or commercial vehicles. Typically offered by a\nbank, a lease line can be a great solution whether you need to preserve\nworking capital for other expenses or you’re in an expansion phase and\nneed financing\nFactoring. If you’ve sold product to a customer who takes a while to\npay, you can sell your accounts receivable (i.e., the invoices) to a third\nparty (called a factor) at a discount. It provides your company with\nimmediate cash\nVendor financing. This is a loan arrangement that takes place between\nyour company and a vendor that supplies large volumes of their product\nto you. The vendor lends money to you so you can buy products from it\nDon’t forget the Human Resources\nHuman resources fall into three categories: personal advice (mentors,\nteachers, and coaches), company advisors, and qualified employees.\nTeachers, coaches, and mentors are people you’ll need to help you\nadvance your personal career. If you want to learn about a specific subject,\nfind a teacher. If you want to hone specific skills or reach an exact goal, hire\na coach. If you want to get smarter and better over the course of your career,\nfind someone who cares about you enough to be a mentor.\nAdvisors are people you’ll need to help advance your company’s\nsuccess. Founders fail when they believe their visions are facts. Listening to\nadvice based on experience can help you sort through whether your vision is\na hallucination. Getting an advisory board (by expanding your circle of\naccumulated wisdom beyond your investors) is so important that it’s an\nexplicit step in the Customer Development process.\nQualified and motivated employees are the difference between a good\nidea that never goes anywhere and a billion-dollar firm. Will your company\nneed dozens of specialized engineers or coders or designers as it grows? If so,\nwhere and how will you find them? Is your city or location a magnet for\nworld-class talent? Is there a shortage of talent? Will offshore teams be\nrequired as the company scales, and how will you select and manage them?\nIn more specialized industries (think avionics, chip design, and biotech) this\nmay be even more challenging if scaling the team quickly is important,\nespecially if the company is headquartered in a smaller or off-the-beaten-path\nlocation to where you’ll have to relocate much of your talent pool in order to\nemploy them. If you’re in a part of the country or the world where the\nnumber of potential employees is limited, how can you be more creative to\nget them? Identify what the human resource needs are now and what they\nwill be two to three years later to be sure that growth won’t be constrained.\nIntellectual Property is a Key Resource\nIntellectual property gives you rights to stop others from using your\ncreativity. The assets you can protect may include your “core technology,”\nsuch as source code, hardware designs, architecture, processes, and formulas.\nOr it can be your brand, logo or domain name. You can protect business\nprocesses, know-how, customer information, and product roadmaps.\nProtection is also available for content such as music, books, and film. Some\nof these assets are protected automatically. For other classes, it’s wise and\nsometimes mandatory to go through a registration, application or examination\nprocess to get full protection.\nTrademark: A trademark protects branding and marks and gives you the\nright to prevent others from using “confusingly similar” marks and logos.\nTrademark protection lasts as long as you use the mark. The more you use the\nmark, the stronger your protection. Trademark registration is optional but has\nsignificant advantages if approved.\nCopyright: A copyright protects creative works of authorship, typically\nsongs, books, movies, photos, etc. Copyright gives you the right to prohibit\nothers from copying, distributing or making derivatives of your work. It\nprotects “expressions” of ideas but doesn’t protect the underlying ideas. (If\nyour product is software, copyright is also used to prohibit someone from\nstealing your software and reselling it as machine and/or source code.)\nCopyright protection lasts practically forever. Registration is optional but is\nrequired for suing for infringement.\nTYPES OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION\nTypes of Intellectual Property Protection (Table 3.6)\nContract: A contract is a binding legal agreement that’s enforceable in a\ncourt of law. There’s no official registration process; you have whatever\nprotection is defined in the contract (e.g., a nondisclosure agreement gives\nyou certain rights to protection of your confidential information). The\nprotection lasts for the time period defined in the contract.\nPatents: A patent is a monopoly the government grants to prohibit\nothers from making, using or selling your invention, even when the other\nparty’s infringement is innocent or accidental.\nJust about anything can be patented—circuits, hardware, software,\napplied algorithms, formulas, designs, user interfaces, applications, systems.\nScientific principles or pure mathematical algorithms may not be patented.\nYour invention must be “nonobvious.” The test for whether it’s nonobvious\nis: given the prior art at the time of the invention, would a typical engineer 1)\nidentify the problem and 2) solve it with the invention? You must be “first to\nfile.” You must file in the U.S. within a year of sale, offer for sale, public\ndisclosure or public use. Your patent application has to include a written\ndescription with details of the claims of the invention. The details have to\nallow others to duplicate your invention from your description and have to\nuse the “best mode” in describing critical techniques/technologies. And it has\nto identify all prior “art,” or solutions to the problem.\nPatent protection typically lasts 15 to 20 years. There is a formal\napplication and examination process. Each patent filing will cost your\ncompany $20,000 to $50,000 and take one to four years to complete. Filing\nof patents is frequently of major interest to people funding your company.\n(There’s something called a “provisional patent” that’s an alternative to a full\npatent. It allows you to claim “first to file” and use the term patent pending.\nProvisional patents get into the patent office quickly and cheaply. However,\nthey automatically expire after one year, and no patent rights are granted.\nProvisional patents are a good placeholder because they’re cheap to file and\ndon’t get in the way of your other patent efforts.)\nIntellectual Property Creates Value\nIntellectual property is an asset for your company. You need to acquire,\nprotect and exploit it. You can map out an intellectual property strategy by\nasking:\nWho are the key players and technologies in its market(s)?\nWhat are the most important ideas and inventions that need patents (or\nprovisional patents)? Start filing these early!\nWhat are the important patent applications that come next?\nFour Common Intellectual Property Mistakes\nStartups Make\n1. Founders didn’t make a clean break with previous employer: Do your\nemployers or university own or have a claim on your inventions? It’s a\nvery subjective standard, and since startups don’t often have resources or\ntime to spend on lawsuits, large companies and universities may use\nthreats of litigation to ensure that you don’t take anything. Therefore the\nbest advice is to “take only memories.”\n2. Your startup cannot show that it owns its intellectual property: Take the\ntime to create a clear, well-documented chain of title (think lab\nnotebooks) to your intellectual property. If you’re using independent\ncontractors, make sure you have written agreements assigning work\ncreated. Make sure you have Employee Invention Assignment\nAgreements. (If you hire subcontractors or friends to do some work, get\nassignment agreements as well.)\n3. You lost your patent rights due to filing delays/invention disclosures: In\nthe U.S., patent rights are forfeited if you wait more than a year after:\n• disclosure in a printed publication (white paper, journal/conference\narticle, website)\n• offer for sale in the U.S. (start of sales effort, price list, price quotation,\ntrade-show demonstration, any demonstration not under NDA, public\nuse in the U.S.)\nIn most foreign countries, there is no one-year grace period.\n4. Your company grants “challenging” licenses to intellectual property:\nStartups acquiring their first customers may give special licensing terms\nin key markets, territories, etc.—e.g., a grant of “most favored nations”\nlicense terms or other licensee-favorable economic terms. This can make\nyour intellectual property less valuable to future buyers of your company.\nOr you may cut a deal that you can’t assign or transfer (or can’t get out\nof) if you get acquired.\nThere May be Other Key Resources\nConsider other external business elements that are vital to the company’s\nsuccess. Celebrity websites need a steady stream of “hot” gossip (this one\nshouldn’t be a problem) and MarthaStewart.com wouldn’t be much without\nMartha. Overstock.com would fail without a stream of good-quality discount\nmerchandise.\nDependency Analysis\nThe company’s dependency analysis basically answers the question “To sell\nour product in volume, what has to happen that’s out of our control?” Things\nout of a company’s control can include other technology infrastructure that\nneeds to emerge (all cell phones become web-enabled, fiber optics are in\nevery home, electric cars are selling in volume). Dependencies also include\nchanges in consumers’ lifestyles or buying behavior, new laws, changes in\neconomic conditions, and so on. Specify what needs to happen (let’s say the\nwidespread adoption of telepathy), when it needs to happen (must be\ncommon among teens by 2020), and what happens if it doesn’t happen (the\nproduct needs to use the Internet instead). Note the benchmarks you’ll use to\nmeasure whether the change is happening when needed.\nIdentify all key resources in this hypothesis, and explain how the\ncompany will make sure those key resources are readily available. Be sure to\nidentify the risks of their unavailability, as well as alternatives that will\nminimize impact on the company’s business model. Be careful not to confuse\npartners (to be discussed next) with resources.\nChecklist 10: Key Resources Hypothesis\nGoal: Identify external resources critical to the company’s success, and how\nthe company will find and secure them\nReference: Chapter 3, Key Resources\nDescribe the all key resources costs, and how they will be acquired\nPhysical resources\nFinancial resources\nHuman resources\nIntellectual property\nOther key resources\nDependency analysis\nExit criteria:\nPhysical, financial, human, intellectual property resources required\nWhat they will cost\nWhere they’ll be found\nHow they will be secured\nUpdate your business model canvas\nPass/Fail tests identified\nTraffic Partners Hypothesis\nIn addition to the four types of partnerships in the physical channel\nsection, there’s a fifth, vitally important type of partner for web/mobile\nstartups: traffic partners. Traffic partners deliver people to websites and\nmobile apps several ways:\non a “cross referral,” or swapping, basis\non a paid-per-referral basis\nby using textlinks, on-site promotions and ads on the referring site\nby exchanging e-mail lists\nAs detailed later in Phase 3 of Customer Validation, these traffic deals\nare as difficult to negotiate as they are important. Develop your hypothesis by\nidentifying the target partners, what you want them to do, and how your\nstartup will reciprocate in cash or in kind.\nPartnerships can sometimes be the lifeblood of a startup. Some examples\nto consider in thinking about traffic partnerships of your own:\nZynga, the online-gaming juggernaut, is overwhelmingly dependent on\nits partnership with Facebook, the only place where Zynga’s popular\nFarmville and other games are played. Without the partnership, Zynga\nwould have little traffic or revenue\nYouTube got much of its early traffic through a partnership with Google,\nso much so that Google bought the company\nSalesforce.com drives traffic and revenue to web/mobile sales and CRM\napplications through its AppExchange\nMobile apps get much of their traffic from dot.com partners\nNiche content retail sites often have similar active partners\nOther partnerships unique to web/mobile channels can also be quite\nimportant: App stores and marketplaces are critical partners for mobile apps,\nsince they’re the apps’ principal channel. (Learn much more about this in the\nchannels section.) Understand how they work, their willingness to partner,\nand the costs. And credit card issuers are often overlooked as partners. They\nsometimes look askance at web content, social networking, gaming and ecommerce businesses (particularly startups and sellers of web/mobile goods),\nsince the card issuers have been burned so many times by un-scrupulous\nentrepreneurs. The result: rigid rules that are often biased against startups.\nIdentify traffic partners your startup will need initially and as it grows.\nDevelop a prioritized list of the must-have and best-to-have partners in each\ncategory. Later, in Phase 3 of Customer Validation, you will conduct\nmeetings with prospective partners to determine if they’re interested and what\nthey will need to make the partnership a mutual success.\nChecklist 11: Partners Hypothesis\nGoal: Identify essential partners and the company’s “value exchange” with\neach\nReference: Chapter 3, Partners and Traffic Partners\nUnderstand Potential Partner Types\nStrategic Alliances\nJoint new business efforts\nCoopetition\nKey suppliers\nTraffic Partners\nList your target partners\nNecessary partners\nWhat they will provide\nHow the Company will reciprocate\nExit criteria:\nUnderstand potential partner types\nList target partners, their contributions and what the company will offer\nin return\nUpdate your business model canvas\nPass/Fail tests identified\nNote to reader: These following guidelines, geared for physical channel\nstartups, are invaluable to web/mobile startups as well.\nPartners Hypothesis (Physical)\nKey partners often provide capabilities, products, or services that the startup\neither can’t or would prefer not to develop itself. Batteries for a flashlight\nmaker or design services for a website are two simple examples. But the most\nfamous is Apple and the iPod. Without the record labels providing music as\ncontent, the iPod and iTunes would simply be another hardware/software\nplayer. The partners made the business model the juggernaut it is today.\nThe key-partners hypothesis names the essential partners your company\nwill require, along with the “value exchange” with each one (as in “we give\nthem money, they send us customers”). Partnerships generally fall into four\nkey areas: strategic alliances; “coopetition,” or cooperation between\ncompetitors; joint new business development efforts; and key supplier\nrelationships.\nThink of this hypothesis as a simple three-column spreadsheet. The\nheadings: partner name (list primary and runner-up candidates), “what they\nprovide,” and “what we provide.” Don’t feel bad when the word money\nappears repeatedly in the third column. It’s fairly typical for startups, at least\nin their early days.\nStrategic alliances, generally between noncompetitive companies, can\noften shorten the list of things your startup needs to build or provide to offer a\ncomplete product or service. For physical products, alliance partners might\nprovide product training, installation or service, peripherals or accessories,\nwhether they’re sold under your startup’s brand name or not. Specialized\nservice firms in many industries (law, accounting, engineering, IT) can often\nmarket a wider range of services by combining their services with those of\nother specialists. Alliances can also be used to broaden a startup’s footprint,\nmaking its product more available in geographies where the startup itself\ncan’t support sales or service.\nJoint new business development efforts generally happen later in a\nstartup’s life, but can be important once the startup has established its own\nidentity and brand. Dell and HP sell lots of software and products made by\nothers, but seldom do so until they’re confident the product has significant\nconsumer demand. Think of these as longer-term opportunities to investigate\nas part of your customer discovery process.\n“Coopetition” similarly happens later in a startup’s life, as a rule. It’s a\nform of working with a direct competitor to share costs or market together.\nNew York City’s “fashion week” is a good example of coopetition for\nestablished fashion houses. While they’re fiercely competitive, they work\ntogether to coordinate fashion show schedules so the top buyers can attend all\nthe key showings. Word for Mac is perhaps the greatest coopetition example\nof all time, but both companies were well-established before the product was\ndeveloped and launched.\nKey supplier relationships can mean life or death for a startup. Imagine\nhow tough it would be to churn out millions of iPhones without Foxconn, the\nmassive Apple manufacturing partner in China, or to make Ben & Jerry’s\nfamed Cherry Garcia without an uninterrupted supply of delicious cherries.\nSuppliers can be instrumental to any company’s success, but tight, flexible\npartnerships can be absolutely critical. Many startups outsource a variety of\n“back office” functions, ranging from warehousing and fulfillment of\nphysical goods to HR, payroll, benefits and accounting. These outsource\nsuppliers act as extensions of the company that leverage the suppliers’\nexpertise to improve the startup’s efficiency and cost structure.\nWill the partner flex its delivery times, order-size requirements, credit\nterms or even its price in your startup’s early days? How will the partner\nensure a steady supply that rises (quickly, we hope) or falls in line with\ncustomer demand? Identify the key suppliers in this hypothesis, along with\nwhat you’ll need from them. You’ll visit with them later to validate this\nhypothesis and understand your role and theirs in forging a mutually\nbeneficial relationship.\nRevenue and Pricing Hypothesis\nThe revenue and pricing brief may well be the toughest of all, but it’s\ncritically important, since it ensures that the business model makes financial\nsense. In a way, this brief is elegantly simple, since it asks only four\nquestions:\n1. How many of these things will we sell?\n2. What’s the revenue model?\n3. How much will we charge?\n4. Does this add up to a business that’s worth doing?\nRevenue Sources, (Figure 3.20)\nWhile some of the issues differ from channel to channel, the process of\ncomputing your company’s revenue is fundamentally the same, regardless of\nchannel. The good news: much of the work for this brief is already complete.\nQuestion 1: How Many Will We Sell?\nIn the physical channel, companies generate revenue by selling their product,\ncollecting revenue either as a one-time sale, via time payments, or through\nsuch financial tools as leasing or subscriptions. They also solicit referrals\nfrom current customers, often rewarding customers for referring others.\nCollect the following revenue stream components from hypotheses\ncompleted earlier:\nMarket size and market share hypotheses, which should translate into\nthe anticipated number of customers (as in 10 percent of a millionperson market = 100,000 customers)\nChannel hypotheses, along with estimates of their volume potential and\nchannel costs\nBe sure to include (subtract, really) the channel’s cost of sales, which\ncan be enormous, since the company only gets to “count,” or keep, net\nrevenue received after channel costs are subtracted. (Enthusiastic\nentrepreneurs make this mistake far too often)\nQuestion 2: What’s the Revenue Model?\nWeb and mobile products in particular have a wider variety of potential\nrevenue sources than their physical channel cousins. (Product sales are the\nprime revenue source for physical products.) Direct revenue sources to\nreview and estimate include:\nSales: Product, app, or service sales are the principal revenue source for\nmany web/mobile startups, typically in a one-time transaction that may\nalso lead to follow-on sales\nSubscriptions: Software, games, and other online products are often sold\nby a monthly subscription\nPay-per-use: Some web products (travel sites and eBay are two simple\nexamples) earn revenue on a “per use” basis, with subscription or\ndiscounted volume purchases optional\nOther web/mobile resources may include:\nReferral revenue: payments for referring traffic or customers to other\nweb/mobile sites or products\nAffiliate revenue (revenue sharing): finder’s fees or commissions from\nother (typically e-commerce) sites for directing customers to them\nE-mail list rentals: subscription and membership sites often rent their\ncustomer e-mail lists to carefully selected advertiser partners\nBack-end offers: add-on sales from other companies offered as part of\nregistration or purchase confirmation processes,\nWhen it comes to advertising sales, two fundamental rules apply. First,\nthe more distinctive, unusual, or hard to reach an audience actually is, the\nmore a marketer will pay to reach it. Private pilots or people who travel on\nprivate jets are far more valuable than “travelers,” and “active multiplayer\ngamers” are worth considerably more than teens.\nRule number two: very few marketers or advertisers will be interested in\nsmall audiences, even if the product or site is destined for huge audiences\ndown the road. The “friction” costs of research, contracts, and paperwork\nrequired just to reach a few thousand (or sometimes half a million) people is\noften just not worth it to an advertiser. Research this question with\nprospective revenue sources and factor the responses into the revenue\ncalculation.\nQuestion 3: How Much Do We Charge? (Pricing\nTactics)\nThis is a two-part question. Part one assesses the costs of doing business. For\nphysical products, this is often far more important. If you’re selling canned\npeas or microwave relay towers, there’s a clear, sizeable cost of the physical\nproduct itself: parts, assembly, packaging, shipping, and more.\nIn business-to-business and some consumer sales, other issues warrant\nconsideration, such as total cost of operation (if rent is high or staff is huge,\nor the electric bill is a high component of product cost).\nPart two of the “how much will we charge” question is simple: “what’s\nthe price?” You will start testing your pricing hypothesis later in discovery,\nbut first there’s a bit more work to do.\nA good pricing model recognizes Market Type, accommodates\nmanufacturing costs, the value the product delivers, market beliefs, and\ncompetitive prices. It also charges “as much as the market will bear” to\nmaximize profits. For best results, start with a deep understanding of\ncompetitive pricing.\nIn web/mobile channels, pricing is much more transparent and\nalmost always easily found online, which heightens the need to monitor\ncompetitive pricing.\nStartups have lots of choices in selecting their pricing models. Among\nthe most popular pricing models:\nValue pricing: Based on the value delivered by the product rather than\nthe cost itself. Investing or accounting software tools, unique patented\nproducts and pharmaceuticals can sometimes optimize profits with this\nmodel\nCompetitive pricing: Positions the product against others in its\ncompetitive set, typically in existing markets\nVolume pricing: Designed to encourage multiple purchases or users, in\nsituations ranging from office supplies to SAAS software\nPortfolio pricing: For companies with multiple products and services,\neach with a different cost and utility. Here the objective is to make\nmoney with the portfolio, some with high markups and some with low,\ndepending on competition, lock-in, value delivered, and loyal customers\nThe “razor/razor blade” model: Part of the product is free or\ninexpensive, but it pulls through highly profitable repeat purchases on an\nongoing basis. (Think of the cost of ink-jet printers compared with the\ncost of the ink.) Often challenging for startups due to the upfront cost\nSubscription: While now thought of as a software strategy, the Book of\nthe Month Club pioneered this for physical products\nLeasing: Lowers the entry cost for customers. Provides constant\nearnings over a period of years\nProduct-based pricing: Based on a multiple of actual product cost.\nUsually for physical goods. (Typically priced for maximum\nrevenue/profit versus volume)\nThis calculus is very different for a web/mobile product, where the\nincremental cost of a new customer is practically zero, as it is for a\nmultiplayer game app that adds, say, 50 new customers to its system at a cost\nmeasured, at most, in pennies per customer.\nTwo Business-to-Business Pricing Issues\nTotal Cost of Ownership/Adoption (TCO): More an issue in business than\nin consumer sales, the TCO analysis estimates the total cost to customers of\nbuying and using the product. For business products, do customers need to\nbuy a new computer to run the software? Do they need training to use the\nproduct? Do other physical or organizational changes need to happen? What\nwill deployment across a whole company cost? For consumer products,\nmeasure the cost of “adopting” the product to fit consumer needs. Do\ncustomers need to change their lifestyle? Do they need to change any part of\ntheir purchasing or usage behavior? Do they need to throw away something\nthey use today?\nReturn on Investment (ROI): When setting prices for sales to\ncorporations, your company may have to prove to them the purchase price\nwas “worth it,” or that they got “a good deal,” which may be less about price\nthan about the total return on their investment. As a rule, companies focus\nmore on ROI than consumers do, partly because of the size of and oversight\non large transactions. ROI represents customers’ expectation of their\ninvestment measured against goals such as problem-solving, productivity,\ntime, money and resources. For consumers, return often includes status or\nstyle and sometimes even just plain fun.\nWhen selling to businesses, prepare a hypothetical ROI in advance of\ninitial customer meetings. (This is often a good subject for a helpful white\npaper.) If the solution doesn’t return a meaningful multiple ROI, sales may be\ndifficult. That $50,000 robot vacuum system as a replacement for a $5,000\nannual cleaning bill may be a tough sell, especially after a good job on the\nTCO (maintenance, electricity, parts and more) as part of the ROI\ncomputation.\nQuestion 4: Do Revenues Point to a Business Worth\nDoing?\nYou have to do more than multiply the volume by the average selling price to\nget the answer to this question, but don’t worry—this answer doesn’t need to\nbe precise just yet. Remember, the goal of customer discovery is to refine a\nbusiness model enough to test it on a larger scale in the next step, customer\nvalidation. So at this point, with a rough view of the gross revenue and all the\nfixed and variable costs involved, make a rough computation of the\nfollowing:\nIs the revenue adequate to cover costs in the short term?\nWill the revenue grow materially if not dramatically over time?\nDoes the profitability get better as the revenues get bigger?\nAgain, this is a rough, back-of-the-envelope calculation used only to\ndecide if what you found in discovery moves your forward to customer\nvalidation. It’s not an accounting exercise.\nWeb/mobile markets are often multi-sided.\nHow Single and Multi-Sided Markets Affect\nFinancials\nCompanies with physical products most often have “single-sided” markets:\ncustomers who buy the one product the company makes.\nWeb/mobile markets are often multi-sided. When a web/mobile startup\nplans to first focus on amassing huge numbers of users, eyeballs, or clicks\nand to “figure out the revenue model later,” this implies a multi-sided market.\nMulti-sided markets have a different business model for each side of the\nmarket. Typically, the business model components that change include value\nproposition, customer segment, customer relationships and revenue stream.\nOne side, the users, is measured in eyeballs, page views, referrals, or\nhours rather than dollars. The other side of the market, the customers,\nconsists of advertisers who pay to reach the users. Hundreds of millions of\nFacebook users think of it as a free social network, and indeed, Facebook\nmakes its money from a completely different customer segment (advertisers)\nwith a completely different value proposition through a different channel\n(direct sales and online self-service).\nCalculate the revenue model for that second side of the market—the\npayers—right now. Understanding what an advertiser is willing to pay to\nreach your startup’s audience is vital to the business model.\nRemember, you have limited resources. Focus first on the one key, big\nsource of revenue before expanding into secondary sources, which can be\ndistracting to the company.\nTwo More Revenue Issues to Consider\nDistribution Channel Affects Revenue Streams. Calculating revenue is\neasy for a product sold directly by your own sales force: You simply deduct\nany discount you gave the customer from the list price of the product. When\nyou sell through indirect channels, revenue calculations might be harder.\nSelling to Walmart is wonderful, but most retails channels have “return\nrights.” (If your product doesn’t move off their shelf, you have to take it\nback.) Are you selling to OEMs where the discount is steep and the revenue\nto your company doesn’t appear until the OEM begins selling in volume?\nConsider Lifetime Value: How much will the customer ultimately spend not\njust in the first sale but over the life of his or her relationship with the\ncompany? SAAS software, dating websites, and online gaming focus on\ncustomer lifetime value. Customers can sign up for salesforce.com, for\nexample, sometimes for a few dollars a month, but the company no doubt\nspends several times that amount to attract and sign a new user. Why?\nBecause it understands that the average salesforce.com subscription lasts\nmany months, making the new customer worth a multiple of the monthly cost\n—provided, of course, that the company stays in business long enough to\ncollect the revenue. (On the other hand, the lifetime value of a demolition\ncontractor’s typical customer often approximates his first invoice.)\nCustomer lifetime value dramatically affects revenue stream and pricing\nstrategy, online or off, although other than magazine and newspaper\nsubscriptions, which are declining rapidly, there are scant few subscription\nproducts beyond gym memberships among physical products.\nFinal Draft of a Business Model Hypothesis (Figure 3.21)\nTie the Components of Revenue Together in a\nHypothesis\nRevenue stream and pricing interact with the value proposition, the channel,\ncustomer relationships, and the other business model components. That\nmeans there’ll be lots of iterating and pivoting. The revenue stream\nhypothesis will be tested repeatedly before it’s cast in stone, first in customer\ndiscovery discussions and again with more customers as part of customer\nvalidation. When the draft of the revenue stream brief is complete, re-validate\nit to see that the math adds up. Ultimately, only one answer matters: can we\ngenerate enough revenue, profits and growth to make this business worth our\ntime and energy?\nCompleting the Hypothesis Development Process:\nThis brief completes the company’s only large-scale paperwork exercise. The\naction now moves outside the building so you can start to understand what\npotential customers need and to qualify or refine the initial hypothesis\nassumptions. But before doing that:\nConvene a team meeting where a large copy of the latest business model\ncanvas and briefs are taped to a wall. A summary of each of the briefs\nshould be adjacent to the canvas\nAll participants should read each of the business model briefs\nLook at the summaries on the canvas, read the details in the briefs,\ndiscuss them as a team, and look for obvious conflicts or\ninconsistencies.\nFounders, product development, engineering and operations teams\nshould again validate cost assumptions and changes\nReturn to the first hypotheses developed to be certain there’s no conflict\nfrom one to the next. Does the sales channel make sense, for example, in\nlight of the pricing, need for installation, etc.? Will fewer customers still\nadequately fund overhead and development?\nReview and agree on the final versions of each hypothesis\nMake certain the hypothesis summaries agree with the summary in the\nappropriate business model box\nUpdate the business model as appropriate\nNow it’s time to move ahead and get out of the office, where customers\nand facts live.\nChecklist 12: Revenue And Pricing Hypothesis\nGoal: See if the business model makes financial sense\nReference: Chapter 3, Revenue and Pricing Hypothesis\nHow many will we sell?\nMarket Size & Market share hypotheses\nChannel hypothesis\nWhat’s the Revenue Model\nSales?\nSubscriptions?\nPay-per-use?\nReferral?\nAffiliate?\nWhat Are the Pricing Tactics\nValue pricing\nCompetitive pricing\nVolume pricing\nPortfolio pricing\nRazor/razor blade model\nSubscription\nLeasing\nFreemium\nEtc.\nDoes it Add up to a Business Worth Doing?\nExit criteria:\nThe units/users, revenue model and pricing add up to a business worth\ndoing\nPass/Fail tests identified\n\nCHAPTER 4\nCustomer Discovery, Phase Two: “Get Out\nof the Building” to Test the Problem: “Do\nPeople Care?”\nPHASE 2 GETS THE TEAM “OUT OF THE BUILDING” to test the problem and to\nanswer three key questions:\nDo we really understand the customer’s problem?\nDo enough people really care enough about the problem for this to\nbecome a huge business?\nAnd will they care enough to tell their friends?\nThe next section, Phase 3, will test to see whether the product offers a\ncompelling solution to customers who have said there’s a problem. When the\n“problem” and “solution” questions are answered with a resounding “yes,”\nproduct/market fit is achieved and it’s time to move on to customer\nvalidation.\nThis problem phase is markedly different for web/mobile startups,\nwhere product development time is far shorter and feedback comes far faster.\nProblem discovery is conducted with the development of a low-fidelity MVP\nwebsite or mobile app. Sometimes as simple as a PowerPoint diagram or a\nsingle web page, this early MVP helps gather immediate feedback about the\nproblem. Later, the solution is tested with a hi-fidelity MVP.\nThis phase includes five key steps:\ndesigning experiments for customer tests\npreparing for customer contacts and engagement\ntesting customers understanding of the problem and assessing its\nimportance to customers\ngaining understanding of customers\ncapturing competitive and market knowledge\nAs this phase gets under way, here’s a reminder of the key rules from\nthe Customer Development Manifesto in Chapter 1:\nCustomer discovery is done by the founders\nHypotheses require testing. Testing requires experiments to be designed\nWeb surveys are nice, but always correlate them with face-to-face\ncustomer feedback, even for web businesses\nCustomer meetings aren’t about learning whether customers love the\nproduct, at least not yet. They’re about understanding the problem and\nhow urgently your potential customers need to solve that problem.\nYou’ll focus more on the product itself once you’re certain the problem\nit solves is big enough to create a market worth going after\nInitial hypotheses rarely survive feedback without iterations or pivots\nDesign Tests and Pass/Fail Experiments\nAt this point, your Phase One business model hypotheses are still just\n“guesses.” In this phase you’ll turn those hypotheses into facts by getting out\nof the building and testing them in front of customers.\nHere’s an easy way to visualize this: think of a three-layer business\nmodel. The bottom layer represents your initial vision of the startup. The\nsecond layer outlines the detailed hypotheses you just developed in Phase\nOne. The third layer shows the tests you’ll conduct to verify and measure\neach hypothesis, turning guesses into facts as you do, so that the business\nmodel can be verified and measured.\nBusiness Model/Hypotheses/Tests (Figure 4.1)\nBut how do you test? Rule number 6 of the Customer Development\nManifesto says to design experiments and Rule 9 says to do it with speed,\ntempo and fast cycle time. So the first step in running a test of your business\nmodel hypotheses is to design simple pass/fail experiments for each test.\nNext you run the tests, and then you gather the data and not only try to learn\nsomething from the test but also try to gain some insight. The\nHypotheses/Experiment/Test/Insight loop is shown in Figure 4.2 below.\nHypothesis/Design Experiment/Test/Insight (Figure 4.2)\nRegardless of whether it’s a physical or web/mobile product, Customer\nDevelopment experiments are short, simple, objective pass/fail tests. You’re\nlooking for a strong signal in the noise. The pass/fail tests give you a “good\nenough” signal to proceed.\nStart by asking yourself, “What do I want to learn?” Then ask, “What’s\nthe simplest pass/fail test I can run to learn?” Finally, think about, “How do I\ndesign a pass/fail experiment to run this simple test?”\nFor example, a Customer Relationships hypothesis for a physical\nproduct may have assumed that for every 10 sales calls three people would\nmove into active consideration of buying. The experiment might be as simple\nas making the same presentation to 30 prospects and having the experiment\n“pass” by coming away with nine or more orders or letters of intent.\nA web business model hypotheses for Customer Relationships and\nRevenue Model may have assumed that you can acquire 5,000,000 customers\nby spending $1 million on Google AdWords. Your pass/fail experiment\nmight take the form “we believe we can acquire visitors with Google\nAdWords at a cost of 20 cents per click.” Your experiment would create three\ndifferent landing pages, allocating $500 in AdWords to each, and\nsequentially testing each landing page (using the same AdWords) every other\nday. A “pass” would get 2,500 clicks per page. Anything less, the hypotheses\nfailed. (A secondary test that falls out of this is which page got the customers\nthe fastest!)\nMost of the time you can mock up the web page or\ncreate a demo or prototype to elicit valuable\nlearning.\nTests\nOne of the things that trips up engineering founders is thinking that these\nhypotheses tests have to be actual code, hardware or the real product. Most of\nthe time you can mock up the web page or create a demo or physical\nprototype to elicit valuable learning. Nor do the tests involve large sums of\nmoney or large amounts of time. When you get a strong “grab it out of your\nhands” on, say, from four of your first ten customers, it’s OK to stop the test\nand declare it a success. The goal is speed, learning and looking for a global\nmaximum (not a local maximum).\nWhat’s a global maximum? Let’s say you run a free trial offer for three\ndays on your great new weekend getaway website and you get 50, then 60,\nthen 80 signups in the first three days. You might say, “Wow, 80, that’s\ngreat,” and end the test. But on day four, the sun comes out. Had you run the\ntest for only two more days, you might have discovered your “global\nmaximum,” 500 signups a day. Only experience and good guesswork can tell\nyou how long to run a test, and while shorter is always better, be sure you’ve\ngiven yourself the opportunity to reach your global maximum.\nGlobal Maximum versus Local Maximum Response Rates (Figure 5.3)\nThe next steps in Phases 2 and 3 and in customer validation provide\ndetails on how to set up tests for both web/mobile and physical products.\nInsight\nThe goal of these experiments/tests is not just to collect customer data. Nor is\nit to simply get “pass” on the pass/fail experiments. And it’s not just to learn\nsomething, though we hope you will.\nIt’s something more profound, intangible and what makes\nentrepreneurship in the end still an art. It’s the fact that you’re looking past\nthe data – you’re looking for insight. Did you get thrown out of sales calls\ntime and again but you remembered someone said, “Too bad you don’t sell x,\nbecause we can use a ton of those.”\nChecklist 13: Design Tests\nGoal: Devise experiments for testing the Business Model Hypotheses\nReference: Chapter 4, Design Tests and Pass/Fail Experiments\nList key areas to learn\nDesign simplest pass/fail tests\nRun Tests\nProcess for tracking learning and insights from test results\nExit criteria:\nObjective pass/fail tests for testing Business Model Hypotheses\nProcess for tracking results\nPass/Fail tests identified\nBuild Your Low Fidelity MVP\nThe tests to qualify your web/mobile business model hypotheses will\nhave you engage thousands of customers in discussions about their problem\nor need. You’ll do this by developing a low fidelity minimum viable product\nthat answers two critical questions: do you understand the customer problem\nor need, and when you do, do lots of customers care?\nThis low fidelity MVP test makes sure the problem or need your\ncompany will address is an urgent one for customers.\nYou’ll build the low fidelity MVP in this step and run the actual tests in\nthe next step.\nThe Low Fidelity MVP Strategy\nAs discussed in Phase 1, the low fidelity MVP can be as simple as a landing\npage with your value proposition, benefits summary, and a call to action to\nlearn more, answer a short survey, or preorder. Or it can be a quick web-site\nprototype in PowerPoint or built with a simple landing-page creation tool.\nMore experienced web developers can build a functional user interface with a\nwireframe prototyping tool and build a working low-fidelity website. No\nmatter what, this is a very basic website without fancy U/I, logos, or\nanimation.\nGet the MVP live as quickly as possible (often the day you start the\ncompany) to see if anybody shares your vision of the customer need/\nproblem. Start with a low-fidelity website that:\ndescribes the problem’s severity in words or pictures (“Does your office\nlook like this?”)\ndescribes the problem, encouraging users to “sign up to learn more”\nshows screen shots of the solution (“pay your bills this way”)\nConsider other simple MVP components like a YouTube video showing\nor discussing the problem, a short online survey on the issue, or a blog asking\nvisitors their opinion.\nIn the next step, you’ll invite consumers to respond as thoroughly as\npossible, giving them several options for doing so. Start by asking for a\nresponse as simple as signing up to learn more. The next most important\nmeasure is whether they’ll rush to tell lots of their friends, which tests the\nvisitor’s view of the importance or magnitude of the problem, or the\nexcitement around the thought of a new online game, for example.\nThe third step invites more detailed feedback via an e-mail or a survey\ntool or by asking the viewer if she’d welcome a call to discuss the new\nproduct or company. Remember: the more a visitor is asked to do, the less\nlikely it is she will respond. So be sure to have the simplest, most basic\nresponse mechanism—like “sign up to learn more”—most prominent on the\nMVP.\nThe tools listed in this section are examples. That are not recommended\nor preferred, just representative of what’s available. New tools appear\ndaily. Do your homework and check www.steveblank.com for the latest\ntools.\nHow to Build a Low Fidelity MVP\nFor non-coders:\nMake a quick prototype in PowerPoint or use Unbounce, Google Sites,\nWeebly, Godaddy, WordPress or Yola\nFor surveys and preorder forms, Wufoo and Google Forms can easily be\nembedded within your site with minimal coding\nFor coders (tips for building the user interface):\nPick a website wireframe prototyping tool (i.e. JustinMind, Balsamiq)\n99 Designs is great for getting “good enough” graphic design and web\ndesign work for very cheap using a contest format. Themeforest has\ngreat designs\nCreate wireframes and simulate your low-fidelity website\nCreate a fake sign-up/order form to test customer commitment.\nAlternatively, create a “viral” landing page, with LaunchRock or\nKickoffLabs\nEmbed a slide show on your site with Slideshare, or embed a video tour\nusing YouTube or Vimeo\nDo user interface testing with Usertesting or Userfy\nBy the way, don’t underestimate the long-term value of design and the\nimportance of user interface. At times even friends and relatives would look\naskance at an MVP that’s so crude it seems like the person who created it is\ntotally out of his depth. But the goal at this stage is not U/I perfection. It is to\ntest a problem. It could be done with a sock-puppet if the test were set up\ncorrectly.\nConsider Using Multiple MVPs\nMany startups develop multiple low-fidelity websites to test different\nproblem descriptions. For example, a simple online accounts payable package\ncan be simultaneously tested three different ways: as fastpay, ezpay, and\nflexipay. Each addresses three different accounts payable problems—speed,\nease of use, and flexibility. Each landing page would be different, stressing\nthe “ease of use” problem, for example. As a simple test of the problem, first\nbuy Google AdWords for each URL and present the problem three different\nways, in the AdWords space and on the landing page. Next, you would rotate\nthe listings so each is on top of the Google stack exactly one-third of the\ntime. (If nobody clicks, return to the start of this chapter.) Which approach\ngenerates the most clicks? Which yields the most sign-ups? The most\nreferrals?\nIn the next step, you’ll turn on the low fidelity MVP you’ve built, and\nsee what happens in the next step. Good luck!\nChecklist 14: Build A Low Fidelity MVP\nGoal: Develop a low fidelity MVP to test and assure problem customers care\nabout the problem\nReference: Chapter 4, Build Your Low Fidelity MVP\nBuild a low fidelity website\nSplash or landing page with value proposition\nBenefits summary\nCall to action (learn more, survey, preorder)\nMultiple MVPs considered?\nExit Criteria:\nA simple live website or prototype for testing whether customers care\nabout the app or site being developed\nPass/Fail tests identified\nLow Fidelity MVP Problem Test\nNow it’s time to see if anybody cares about the problem you’re solving or\nthe need you’re fulfilling. It’s time to gradually invite people to the MVP you\nbuilt in the previous step, see how they respond, and measure how and what\nthey do.\nWARNING!! PROCEED WITH CAUTION. This step should be\ntaken gradually, as your new product is meeting the public for the first\ntime. Please resist the temptation to “go live” until you’ve read the next\nfew pages.\nJust because the MVP is live doesn’t mean anyone will find it\n(remember that the web is a vast place with zillions of sites). So start inviting\npeople to experience the MVP (at most, a few hundred at a time). Follow the\nplan outlined in your “get customers” hypothesis, accelerating the pace of\ncustomer acquisition slowly and watching every action or inaction closely.\nAfter all, this is the first time your product hypotheses will actually meet real\ncustomers, and the learning is likely to be intense.\nSome of your hypotheses might be shot down in flames in the first hour\nor two. For example, most entrepreneurs would change something if they\ninvited 50 friends to an MVP “problem” page and not a single one clicked or\nsigned up. Imagine your surprise if you bought a list of 1,000 mothers of\ntoddlers and three just accepted your invitation to join “toddlermom.com.”\nThe customer relationships hypothesis developed in Phase 1 details how\nyou’ll “get” potential customers to the MVP, app, or site. Review it and take\nmini-bites of several acquisition and activation tactics you believe will bring\nyou hordes of customers. (Think of each tactic you’re planning as a jug of\nfuel. Start with an eye-dropper full and check the results. If they look good,\nas outlined in your hypothesis, pour in a tablespoon, a pint, or maybe a\nquart.) Remember that this is a small-scale test to determine whether your\nstartup is solving a problem or need that customers care a great deal about.\nThere are three basic ways to invite people to engage on your site, and\nyou should likely use all three: push, pull or pay.\nPush people toward your site or app by using e-mails, their friends, or\nsocial media to get them there; pull them with SEO and pay-per-click or other\ndevices; and pay is just what it says—buy lists, clicks, or other tools that\ndeliver eyeballs.\n“Push” Contacts Need Referral Sources: Reach out to friends and contacts\nusing e-mails, texts, and social messaging tools such as Twitter, Facebook\nand LinkedIn. Encourage them to e-mail friends and colleagues and to use\ntheir Twitter, Facebook, Google+ and LinkedIn accounts to reach as many\nother people as possible. Obtain the longest possible list of e-mail addresses.\nWorry less about the details in these efforts and more about getting a big list.\nAn invitation always works better when it comes from someone known to the\nrecipient.\nProvide a draft message your friends can use when reaching out on\nbehalf of the company. It should express support for the idea and the value of\nexploring the problem. The e-mail should be short and as personal as possible\nand should indicate a strong relationship between founder and sender.\n“Pull” Strategies: Pull can be ads, textlinks or AdWords and natural search\ndriving people to the MVP, app or site. Pull solves three problems:\nThere’s no need to cajole everyone for e-mail addresses\nOnly people interested in the issue, problem or need will respond\nPeople who are pulled are more likely to respond, perhaps repeatably\nHere are some ways to pull people into the discussion:\nGoogle AdWords\ndisplay ads or textlinks on social networks (Facebook, et al.) or relevant\nwebsites\npress releases with links to a survey or site about the problem\ngetting bloggers to blog about the problem and invite commentary\nexploring the many online feedback tools available\n“Pay” for Contacts: Buy lists of targeted business or consumer prospects.\nTypically the least attractive startup option for obvious (cash) reasons, this is\nusually the fastest option. A few to consider:\nE-mail lists: Buy permission-based e-mail lists. The more narrow or\nfocused the targeting, the greater the cost. Response rates are still\nchallenging with this approach\nOnline survey tools: Buy a package of respondents, survey design,\nimplementation and a guaranteed number of targeted responses from one\nof many suppliers such as Markettools\nEstablished mobile data vendors: Vendors with credentials, high-quality\nclients and high ethical standards are a must in this channel. Check\nreferences thoroughly, since it’s easy to violate federal laws\nHire a publication: Some trade and online media will survey their readers\nfor you at a cost. It’s expensive but helps with targeting and response\nbecause of the medium’s credibility\nMissteps to Avoid when Testing the Low Fidelity MVP:\nCustomer discovery slips from the hands of founders and becomes a task\nfor specialists (consultants, employees, etc.)\nComments are summarized, averaged, and amalgamated, which tends to\nblur or hide the most distinct “outlier” comments that often lead to\niterations and pivots\nNational laws on mobile messaging and privacy need to be understood\nand respected. Penalties are substantial\nOnline tools provide very little chance for context and dialogue that\n“drill down” in key discovery areas\nAs a rule, people pay far less attention when filling out online surveys\nthan they do in face-to-face conversation\nOnline feedback is not a substitute for leaving the building and talking\ndirectly to customers, some of whom can be initially identified online.\nDon’t let online interaction stand alone\nYou Don’t Have Real Data Until You See Their\nPupils Dilate\nPeople lie on the web. And if you’re depending only on web data, you’ll\nnever know it. Correlate response you get online with “ground truth.” The\nbest way to do that is to interview some of the sources of your web data in\nperson. You don’t have real data until you’ve seen their pupils dilate.\nIn addition, in-person interviews can test how well your MVP is\nexplaining the need or problem, particularly if you show the customer several\nMVPs and learn which they like best and why. Can the customer “play back”\nthe value proposition or problem statement after a brief explanation? Do they\nget palpably excited, or do they politely meander through the discussion?\nTalk about how extensively this problem affects their friends or coworkers\nand whether they’d be likely to buy a problem that solves it. Keep a close ear\nto the ground for outliers and comments like “It’d be much more important if\nyou did this” or “Isn’t that the same as product x, which never works right?”\nThose one-off comments are where pivots and iterations in the business\nmodel are most often found.\nDrive Traffic and Start Counting\nAs soon as you can, begin e-mailing, Tweeting, calling, and inviting\neveryone you know to come visit and react to the MVP. One of the strategies\nof a web or mobile app is to instrument the product and measure and analyze\neverything. Use web analytics to track hits, time spent on-site, and source.\nFor your initial site, Google Analytics may provide adequate information\nwith the fastest setup. Once you’ve moved beyond your initial MVP, you’ll\nwant to consider a more advanced analytic platform (Kissmetrics, Mixpanel,\nKontagent, etc.). Create an account to measure user satisfaction\n(GetSatisfaction, UserVoice, etc.) with your product and to get feedback and\nsuggestions on new features.\nMeasure how many people care about the problem or need and how\ndeeply they care. The most obvious indicator is the percentage of invitees\nwho register to learn more. Next you need to learn if visitors think their\nfriends have the same need or problem, so include widgets for forwarding,\nsharing and Tweeting the MVP.\nFocus on the conversion rates. If the MVP got 5,000 page views and 50\nor 60 sign-ups, it’s time to stop and analyze why. If 44 percent of the people\nwho saw an AdWord or textlink to the MVP signed up, you’re almost\ncertainly on to something big. What percentage of people invited to the test\nactually came? What percentage of people in each test (a) provided their email address, (b) referred or forwarded the MVP to friends, or (c) engaged\nfurther in a survey, blog, or other feedback activity? Of those who answered\nsurvey questions, how many declared the problem “very important” as\nopposed to “somewhat important?”\nSpecific questions, such as “Is there anything preventing you from\nsigning up?” or “What else would you need to know to consider this\nsolution?” tend to yield richer customer feedback than generic feedback\nrequests. If possible, collect e-mail addresses so you have a way to contact\npeople for more in-depth conversations.\nA powerful way to test a problem uses the Net Promoter Score™,\ndeveloped by Satmetrix as a gauge of customer interest in the problem or\nneed. The Net Promoter Score asks customers to answer a single question on\na 0-to-10 scale, where 10 is “extremely likely” and 0 is “not at all likely”:\n“How likely is it that you would recommend our company to a friend or\ncolleague?” Based on their responses, customers are categorized into one of\nthree groups: Promoters (9-10 rating), Passives (7-8 rating), and Detractors\n(0-6 rating). The percentage of detractors is subtracted from the percentage of\npromoters to obtain a Net Promoter Score. An NPS of +50 is considered\nexcellent.\nAnalyze the results carefully. Dissect the numbers finely to determine if\nsome customer segments or media drove particularly enthusiastic customers\nto engage with the MVP. For example, if 92 percent of teen girls forwarded\nthe information to all their friends while nobody else expressed any serious\ninterest, your business may still be quite viable.\nConsider the Scalability: Not only is finding customers who care a daunting\nchallenge, you need lots of them to be successful. What if your startup\nreaches break-even at 1 million activated users, for example (a modest goal\nfor many venture-backed web businesses)? In the customer creation phase,\nyou might need to invite 500 million people to visit—a potentially\nbackbreaking expense if you hope to activate a million users.\nHere’s the math:\nNumber of people exposed to the site or product 500,000,000\n2% of those exposed are actually acquired (1 in 50) 10,000,000\n10% of those acquired become activated customers (1 in\n10)\n1,000,000\ncustomers\nUnless customer acquisition is almost totally viral in this hypothetical\ncompany, the costs of reaching 500 million people will result in running out\nof money. To avoid it, be sure you’ve found an important, painful problem or\na serious customer need (then solve the problem or fill the need). The ability\nto attract large numbers of customers will make or break the business. If\nresponse rates don’t at least approach those in the customer relationships\nhypothesis, it’s time to revisit the business model.\nThe “Just Do It” Scramble\nIncreasingly, even at this early stage of customer discovery, some investors\nencourage startups to break all the rules and “just do it”—launch the product\neven if it doesn’t exist. (Entrepreneurs are legendary rule-breakers anyway.)\nThat’s always an option, however your investors have a portfolio of 10, 20 or\nmore startups like you. Their bets are across the entire portfolio. You, on the\nother hand, make a bet on a portfolio of one. There are times when tossing\nthis book out and “going for it” makes sense (market bubble, incredible\ncustomer reaction to the concept, etc.), but make sure you understand why.\nChecklist 15: Low Fidelity MVP Problem Test\nGoal: Determine whether enough people care about the problem the startup\nis solving or need it is fulfilling\nReference: Chapter 4, Low Fidelity MVP Problem Test\nInvite customers to the Low Fidelity MVP\nPush tactics\nPull tactics\nPaid tactics\nCollect e-mails for future contact\nMeasure response\nRaw web hits\nConversion rates\nTime spent on site\nSource of users\nIn-person interviews in addition to online responses\nProcess for analyzing feedback, determining scalability\nExit criteria:\nRobust customer interest in the problem or need\nHigh response rate to startup’s proposed solution\nPass/Fail tests identified\nGain Customer Understanding\nIn addition to checking your assumptions about customer problems, you need\nto validate your hypotheses about how customers actually spend their days,\nspend their money and get their jobs done. Whether the product is for\ncorporate customers, a social network, or a new consumer electronic device,\nyou want to understand in detail how their lives or jobs work, how their\nwork/design flow happens and how they currently solve the problem or fill\nthe need.\nIf they’re in a business, are their jobs done in isolation? If not, how do\nthey interact with other departments? What other products do they use? Is the\nproblem they’ve identified limited to them, or do others in the company share\nit? Is it possible to quantify the impact (dollars, time, costs, etc.) across the\nentire organization? The same questions work for consumers. Will they use\nthe product themselves? Does it depend on others or their friends and family\nusing it?\nYou’ll want to check your assumptions about whether and how much\npeople will pay for your solution. What would make customers change the\nway they do things? Price? Features? A new standard? If the customer’s eyes\nhaven’t glazed over yet, dip your toe into the hypothetical product spec. “If\nyou had a product like this (describe yours in conceptual terms), what\npercentage of your time could be spent using the product? How missioncritical is it? Would it solve the pain mentioned earlier? What would be the\nbarriers to adopting a product like this?” (If you’re a founder who has been in\nthe industry you’re entering, you may already be a domain expert and already\nbring deep customer understanding.)\nSince someday soon your startup will have to create demand to reach\nthese customers, use this opportunity to find out how they learn about new\nproducts. Who are the visionaries in the press/analyst/blogging community\nwhom they read? Whom they respect?\nFinally, never pass up an opportunity to spot talent. Can these customers\nbe helpful in the future? For the next round of conversations? For an advisory\nboard? As a paying customer? To refer you to other customers?\nYour goal, after enough of these customer conversations, is to be able to\nstand up in front of your company and say, “Here were our hypotheses about\nour customers, their problems, and how they worked. Now here’s what\nthey’re saying their issues really are, and this is how they really spend their\nday.”\nYour goal is to understand the customer in depth. What does in depth\nmean? It’s impossible to know their jobs as well as they do, but you should\nbe so thoroughly conversant with what truly matters to customers that you\ncan discuss their issues convincingly.\nIn business-to-business companies, experience the customer at work, or\nat the very least observe it. Spend a day behind a cash register, at a trade\nshow, or at a conference the target customers are likely to attend. Buy lots of\ncoffees and have lots of casual conversations. Your goal should be to know\nthe customer you’re pursuing, and every aspect of his or her business, so\ndeeply and intimately that they start to think of you and talk to you as if you\nwere “one of them.”\nKnow the customer you’re pursuing so deeply they\nthink you’re “one of them.”\nUnderstanding customers for web/mobile applications starts with this\nstrategic view:\nFor consumer applications, the web is replacing the face-to-face social\ninteractions that people have had since we came down from the trees.\nFriendships are taking on new meaning, having essentially moved online, to\nsocial networks. Texting has replaced conversations, photo sharing has\neclipsed the sharing of snapshots, and online games have replaced board\ngames. “Traveling” salesmen spend more time on Skype and WebEx than on\nthe road and network through LinkedIn, Jigsaw and Facebook. Even\ngrandparents often video-chat as much as they visit.\nBusiness applications have gone the same way.\nSo as you gather customer data, ask yourself, “What are we replacing?\nWhy? How will it change what people now do physically?”\nUnderstanding Customer Interactions (Figure 4.3)\nTactically, it’s equally important to “become a customer” of existing\nweb/mobile products to get a feel for how customers are getting their jobs\ndone or needs fulfilled today. To do so, start to act like a customer:\nParticipate in their culture. Read their websites and publications, watch\ntheir favorite videos, movies and TV shows, and share as many\ncustomer experiences as possible\nGet to know real live customers, not just in focus groups but in the\nplaces where they really spend time. Observe when they’re online and\nwhen they’re off and what they’re doing each time they pick up their\nhandheld: what app are they using, who are they texting or talking to,\nwhy did they choose this minute to play game A instead of game B, and\nhow did they learn about games A and B in the first place?\nPlay the games they play, use the apps they use, participate in their\nsocial networks and regularly visit the sites they regularly visit. You can\ninternalize the customer’s experience by observing it in depth and\nunderstanding his behavior and motivation\nSeek to understand, quantitatively, how and where they discover new\nways to spend their time. From friends? From the “top seller” lists on an\napp store? On the airplane or the school bus?\nThe goal is to “become the customer.”\nChecklist 16: Gain Customer Understanding\nGoal: In-depth understanding of potential customers\nReference: Chapter 4, Customer Discovery, Get Out of the Building to Test\nthe Problem. Do People Care?\nResearch and Customer interviews\nHow customers’ money and time are spent\nCurrent workflow\nPain or need\nCurrent solution and cost\nHow workflow would change with startup’s product\nCustomer publications\nCustomer influencers\nSpend a day doing what customers do\nAttend customer events\nBecome a customer\nTheir websites and publications\nOnline experiences\nHow and where they spend time\nHow and where they discover new ways to spend time\nReport card for recording information learned\nProcess for analyzing data collected\nExit criteria:\nIn-depth understanding of customers, what they read, who they listen\nto, how they work, spend leisure time and money\nPass/Fail tests identified\nTraffic/Competitive Analysis (Web/Mobile)\nThe tools and tactics for developing market knowledge in the physical\nchannel work equally well in the web/mobile channels. Start by searching the\nweb and attending conferences, trade shows and other events to uncover great\nmarket insights. In addition, meet-ups of local groups focused on certain\nindustries, particularly in the tech world, can be a great source of market\nknowledge, as can webinars conducted by competitors.\nWeb-market knowledge should deliver a complete understanding of the\ncompany’s competitors and how potential customers solve the problem or\naddress the need.\nUse free traffic-measurement tools to compare and\nunderstand the traffic generated by each\ncompetitive product...\nUse free traffic-measurement tools like Alexa and Compete to compare\nand understand the traffic generated by each competitive product or website,\nalong with the traffic sources, growth trends, and demographic information\nwhere available. Much of this information is available for free, including the\nkeywords driving traffic to the site, specific lists of sites linking to it and, in\nsome cases, demographic and income data on site visitors. Compete.com\noffers side-by-side comparison of multiple url’s, for example. Visit “answer”\nsites like Quora.com and start asking questions. This will cause more market\ninformation to surface and probably lead to new sources of expertise on\nproduct, category or market.\nMobile startups should visit every app store for each appropriate\nplatform to identify competitors and their categories. Where do the\ncompetitors rank within the category, and is that rank ascending or\ndescending? Try to determine at least approximate sales volumes wherever\npossible. And read the product reviews both at the stores and in categoryspecific review sites. There are particular challenges posed by the Apple app\nstore. Their review process and lack of transparency in distribution (how\nmany people see your app, how many click through, how many download)\nmake accurate measures of acquisition/engagement difficult to come by.\nSummarizing the results and reviewing them with the management team\nis helpful, ensuring that everyone is well-versed in the competitive arena the\nproduct is about to enter. Organize the competitive findings themselves into a\ncompetitive grid and a market map to help position and market the new\nproduct.\nChecklist 17: Capture Market Knowledge,\nTraffic/Competitive\nGoal: Gain understanding of overall market\nReference: Chapter 4, Traffic/Competitive Analysis\nMeet with peers in adjacent markets, industry analysts, journalists,\nother key influencers\nIndustry trends\nKey unresolved customer needs\nKey players\nMust-read/Must-ask/Must-meet\nPotential competitors/Innovators in the space\nResearch!\nTrends\nKey players/Influencers\nBusiness models\nKey metrics\nTraffic measurement, comparison tools\nApp stores\nQuora.com\nConstruct a Competitive grid\nConstruct a Market map\nAttend Industry events\nDemos\nHands-on time with competitive and adjacent products\nSpot talent, trends\nExit criteria:\nIn-depth understanding of the overall market, its trends, players, current\nproducts and vision for growth\nPass/Fail tests identified\nNote to reader: These following guidelines, geared for physical channel\nstartups, are invaluable to web/mobile startups as well.\nCapture Market Knowledge (Physical)\nWith a better customer understanding under your belt, it’s time to round out\nyour understanding of the overall marketplace. Meet with companies in\nadjacent markets, industry analysts, people in the press, and other key\ninfluencers. Go to industry trade shows and conferences to understand the\nshape and direction of the market you’re about to create.\nWhen you start a company, you should have some vague notion of what\ncompanies are in adjacent markets or are part of the infrastructure or\necosystem of your business. Through your own contacts, but usually through\nintroductions, take peers out to lunch. In exchange, gather information—not\ncompetitive information but answers to questions such as: What are the\nindustry trends? What are key unresolved customer needs? Who are the key\nplayers in this market? What should I read? Whom should I know? What\nshould I ask? What customers should I call on?\nWhat will motivate these people to meet? Most won’t do it out of the\ngoodness of their hearts; rather, they’ll meet to make a “trade.” They’ll learn\nabout a key problem and its solution in exchange for providing their industry\nknowledge and insights.\nJust as you did with your problem presentation to potential customers,\ndon’t present or sell—just listen and learn. Spend the time to take a few of\nthe friendliest customers to lunch and ask them who they see as potential\ncompetitors, both internally and externally. Who do they think has similar\nproducts? Who else is an innovator in this space? Has this solution been tried\nelsewhere in their company? Is anyone else inside their company trying to\nbuild this product? It’s amazing how much you can learn from the people\nwho will eventually buy your product.\nAsk the same questions of peers in adjacent markets, and after practicing\non them, try to make contact with the key industry influencers and\nrecommenders listed in Phase 1 and ask them the same set of questions.\nIt’s a rare company that doesn’t have a website. These provide a treasure\ntrove of information, literally available at one’s fingertips, about competitors,\nthe market, and the industry where the company plans to compete. Start by\nGoogling the problem and reading perhaps the first few hundred links. Be as\nspecific as possible in selection of search terms, and try several different\nsearches for maximum information. This effort leads to a wealth of market\ninformation, including news about the category, companies providing\nsolutions, key blogs and websites addressing the industry, industry experts,\nand consultants.\nTake competitors to lunch.\nThen dive deeper into each competitor uncovered in the initial search.\nFind out not only what they say about themselves but also what others say\nabout them—positive and negative. Try to discern key product features and\nselling points, which help differentiate the new offering from competition.\nCollect industry and competitive press releases, studies, and reports, and\nfollow the thread to the consultants, researchers or pundits who wrote them to\nsee what else they’ve said.\nNext, start gathering quantitative market data. More than likely, Wall\nStreet analysts issue reports on the market or adjacent markets. Get copies of\nall of these reports. More important, actually read them. Understand what the\nanalysts believe are the trends, the players, business models, and key metrics.\nFinally, industry conferences and trade shows are invaluable and\nessential. Never say, “I’m too busy to attend.” Attend at least two key\nconferences or trade shows (the important ones picked in Phase 1). Not only\ndo they provide great trinkets, but conferences and trade shows are the prime\nareas for both talent-and trend-spotting. Ask usual questions about trends and\nplayers, but this time accomplish a few things that can’t happen anywhere\nelse. Get demos of competitive and adjacent products. Get your hands on the\nproducts themselves, get competitors’ literature, talk to their salespeople, and\ngenerally immerse yourself in your new industry. Attend as many conference\nsessions as possible, listening to others describe their products. What are their\nvisions of the future, and how do they compare with your own newly\ndeveloped value proposition?\nAfter testing the customer problem (or need) and gaining a complete\nunderstanding of the customer, it’s time to expose the product itself to\npotential customers for the first time. Not to sell to them but to get their\nfeedback. Before doing so, be sure to update the hypotheses and business\nmodel wherever changes are indicated.\n\nCHAPTER 5\nCustomer Discovery, Phase Three: “Get\nOut of the Building” and Test the Product\nSolution\nSTEVE’S PHONE RANG AND THE VOICE ON THE end said, “You don’t know me\nbut I just read your book and think I need your help.” That was the day we\ngot to know one of the most innovative startups within a “Fortune 500”\ncorporation (#6): General Electric’s Energy Storage division.\nPrescott Logan, the unit’s brand-new general manager, recognized that\nhis unit’s new sodium industrial battery was a disruptive innovation, which\nGE traditionally does well, but aimed at a market where the end users were\nunknowns. Logan realized his division looked more like a multimillion-dollar\nstartup with all the usual startup uncertainty, but located within a huge,\nexecution-oriented company. He needed a framework or architecture to help\nhis team deal with a “white space” market and apply startup “search” and\ncustomer discovery principles at a company known for “six sigma”\nexecution.\nEnergy Storage was buying capital equipment, breaking ground on a\nmassive factory, and out making sales calls—in full “execute” mode, the way\nmost big companies work—based on a ton of diligence and an external\nconsultant’s 30,000-foot view of the opportunity, but not likely having had\nenough face-to-face end user conversations.\nSoon after the call, the customer-facing team came to the ranch to map a\ncustomer discovery plan. They had a clear fix on the “customer problem”\n(life cycle, wider range of operating temperatures, etc.), and knew how they’d\ntake the well-vetted innovation from the lab to manufacturing, but one\nquestion remained. Who would buy it in volume, and why? In two days of\nbrainstorming, the Customer Development process offered GE the following\ninitial observations:\nThe new GE battery should serve dozens of market segments, not just\nthe two they’d selected: backup systems for cell towers and data centers\nThey needed to look many more customers in the eye to validate the\nmarket selection\nProduct managers were spending too much time in Schenectady, N.Y.\nheadquarters, where there were no customers and no answers.\nCustomers were outside the building\nWith an existing global customer base, GE had plenty of access to\npotential customers\nThey needed to find earlyvangelists, essential when launching new\ntechnology like GE’s, and determine the earlyvangelists’ characteristics\nas well as how to find them\nThey needed a formal process to review what discovery data they’d\ngathered to date to understand how different the value proposition was\nfor each market segment—and where the opportunities might be greatest\nfor a high-performance, more expensive alternative to lead-acid\nindustrial batteries (far bigger versions of the one in your car)\nWhat other business model “boxes” would customers like them to\nchange in order to sign a purchase order? The GE team uncovered\nseveral including changing the product features themselves, making the\nproduct somewhat configurable, and offering leasing and other\nalternative financing models\nPrescott grasped Customer Development faster and better than anyone\nwe had ever seen. The Energy Storage division was a startup. All the rules for\nmanaging and launching product line extensions—business plans and\nrevenue models—didn’t work. They needed instead to first test their basic\nhypotheses about their business model.\nLeaving the ranch, Prescott and team joined the million-mile club as\nthey flew across the U.S. and to Asia, Africa and the Middle East, meeting\nface-to-face with dozens of prospects, suspects, and influentials to explore\nmultiple potential new markets and applications. They did their best to leave\nPowerPoint decks behind, and listen to customers’ problems, needs, and\nfrustrations with the battery status quo. Unscripted, open-ended discussions\nwith a wide range of prospects were conducted worldwide to listen about\nhow prospects bought their batteries, how often they used them, and the\noperating conditions. In one target market, Prescott actually relocated a top\ncustomer development team member and his family to India and said “don’t\ncome home til you get a purchase order signed,” which he did, learning\nimmensely about how his target segment customers might use the battery and\n—more important—how they’d evaluate and buy.\nTalking to a wide range of prospects, the team soon found more market\nsegments, and even though they aren’t huge businesses yet, they’re promising\nbecause the product’s unique capabilities “unlock” far more value for users in\ncertain segments. For example, the battery’s small footprint and\nenvironmental friendliness make it a far better choice as a backup to\ncomputer systems in high-rise office buildings, where real estate is expensive\nand the floors often can’t hold the weight of massive lead-acid battery arrays.\nIn one case, they found an architect who said “I don’t really care what it\ncosts, I want it.”– the precise definition of an earlyvangelist!\nIt was customer discovery and early validation on steroids, driven by a\npassionate entrepreneurial CEO (though Jeff Immelt has that particular title)\nwho’d stand up against any valley startup leader. Prescott’s boss, GE VP\nTina Donikowski, provided cover while the team executed the thorough,\nhonest search process any startup must have, rather than the six sigma\nexecution drills that made GE so famous. And Prescott chose people who\ndidn’t fit the typical big company mold: “white space” thinkers who lived for\nthe search and embrace the unknown.\nWhile the jury is still out, and the business is a long way from its huge\nrevenue goals, this team of passionate entrepreneurs hiding in a “Fortune 6”\ncompany have just about posted a “sold out” sign on the factory for its first\nsix months of operation. We think that sign has a good chance of being up for\na while.\n“Test the Solution:” an Overview\nThe previous phase tested the customer problem or need and explored\ncustomers’ passion for it, This phase tests whether the solution to that\nproblem—the value proposition—gets customers’ enthusiastic enough to\nbuy/use the product. This phase has five steps:\nUpdate the business model and team—a Pivot or proceed point\nCreate the product solution presentation (physical channel) or the high\nfidelity MVP test (web/mobile)\nTest the “product solution” (physical channel) or begin to measure\ncustomer behavior (web/mobile channel)\nYet again, update the business model and team\nIdentify the first advisory board members\nWeb/mobile startups find it hard for customers to visualize the\nproposed solution without a minimum viable product. (Most startups should\nhave at least their low fidelity MVP up by now.) The MVP illustrates the\nproduct for customers so they can see whether the minimally featured product\nsolves the problem. Feedback takes the form of online and in-person\ndiscussions. (Screen shots and mock-ups are no longer viable stand-ins.)\nUpdate the Business Model and Team (a Pivot-orProceed Point)\nWith a far deeper understanding of customers and their problems, it’s time\nfor an important pivot-or-proceed pause in the Customer Development\nprocess. While some startups have already pivoted, every entrepreneur should\nuse this step to take a pause and review the collection of customer feedback\nabout the problem and its importance. Those findings, coupled with extensive\ncustomer, industry, and competitive research, have taught the company a\ngreat deal about its customers, how they work or play, the market, and the\nproblem the company has been founded to solve. This learning makes it a\nnear-certainty that at least some business model hypotheses need to change.\n(When a substantial change is made to one or more business model\nhypotheses, it’s a pivot.)\nStart this phase by gathering as much of the company management as\npossible (not just the founders and VPs but directors and managers as well),\nalong with key investors, for the pivot-or-proceed review. Share everything\nthat’s been learned, with a focus on customer feedback regarding the\nimportance or severity of the problem or need—the potential product/market\nfit. The group also reviews new findings that may affect hypotheses or\nassumptions made in Phase 1, adjusting them where appropriate. These can\noften include the value proposition or product specs, customer segments,\npricing, and revenue model assumptions.\nStart by Assembling the Data\nBefore the meeting, the Customer Development team gathers all the customer\ndata and builds a work-flow map of the prototypical customer. At the meeting\nitself, the spokesperson for the team diagrams and describes how customers\nactually do their job and whom they interact with. This provides a reality\ncheck of the customer hypotheses. Keep diagramming and drawing until it’s\neasy to explain how customers’ businesses and lives work today, including\nhow they spend their time and money. Compare this description with the\ninitial hypotheses. (While corporate customers may have more formal\norganization to diagram, a consumer will have more external influencers to\ntrack.)\nWith the customer work flow and interactions fully described, dive into\nthe real news. What problems did customers say they have? How painful are\nthese problems? Where on the “problem scale” are the customers you\ninterviewed? How are they solving these problems today? Draw the customer\nworkflow with and without your product. Is the difference dramatic? Did\ncustomers say they would pay for that difference? In general, what did you\nlearn about customers’ problems? What were the biggest surprises? What\nwere the biggest disappointments?\nQuestion Everything\nOnce the Customer Development team has presented its findings, the fun\nbegins. You can now ask the most difficult question. Given all that’s been\nlearned from talking to customers, how well do the preliminary product specs\nsolve their problems? Dead on? Somewhat? Not exactly? If the answer is\n“somewhat” or “not exactly,” this meeting becomes a soul-searching,\ncompany-building exercise. Is it because the right people weren’t\ninterviewed? Failed to talk to enough people? Because nobody asked the\nright questions? This assessment is critical because of a fundamental\nassumption of the Customer Development model: before changing the\nproduct, keep looking for customer enthusiasm. If and only if no customers\ncan be found for the product, discuss changing the feature list.\nPeople who talk to customers tend to collect a list of features that, if\nadded, will get one additional customer to buy. Soon there’s a 10-page\nfeature list just for selling 10 customers. In contrast, in Customer\nDevelopment the goal is to have a single-paragraph feature list that can be\nsold to thousands of customers.\nWhat if everyone believes you’re talking to the right customers but the\nfeedback says you’re building the wrong product? Something has to change.\nDon’t continue building the product and think miracles will happen. Either\nget back outside the building and find a different set of customers who will\nbuy the product or consider changing the features.\nAssuming the product is at least a partial fit for customers’ problems,\ncontinue examining the product assumptions and specs. Based on customer\nfeedback, review the Phase 1 feature list. Prioritize the features in terms of\ntheir importance to the customer. Can the Customer Development team\nmatch each feature to a customer problem? If not, why not? While figuring\nout what features to ship is important, knowing which features don’t matter is\nequally important. Which features did customers not care about? Can any\nfeatures on the product spec be deleted or deferred? Remember, in a startup\nthe Customer Development team isn’t supposed to be adding features; it’s\nsupposed to be finding out the minimum feature set, based on input from\nvisionary customers.\nNext, review and get agreement on the delivery schedule, again revising\nPhase 1 assumptions as necessary. As noted earlier, visionary customers,\nparticularly in corporations, will be buying into the entire vision, not just the\nMVP. They will need to hear what the company plans to deliver over the next\n18 months.\nEarlyvangelists need to hear about the 18-month\nproduct roadmap.\nFinally, as a group, review the other Phase 1 hypotheses. (Now it’s clear\nwhy writing them all down was important.) Given all the feedback from\ncustomers, which of the four market types is the company in? Why is it\ndifferent? What are its competitive advantages? Do the initial pricing and\ndelivery channel assumptions hold up? What was learned about influencers?\nWhile this step is largely the same for web/mobile startups, they\nhave the advantage of more behavioral data to assess. Web/mobile startups\ncan quantify customer interest in and enthusiasm for solving the problem or\nfilling the need. The analysis shouldn’t care whether 2.5 percent or 3.2\npercent of the customers were interested but should instead assess whether\nthis is a big, serious “hair-on-fire” problem that many customers are eager to\nsolve. Customer discovery data is limited because online problem discovery\nis conducted on a small scale, so right now your analysis is simply directional\nin nature. Some signs that the problem or need is sizable or serious:\nAt least 10 percent (25 percent or 50 percent is even better) of customers\nexposed to the problem somehow indicate their interest in solving it\nMany of those exposed to the problem pass information along to friends\nor coworkers\nA Net Promoter Score of at least +50 or, ideally, far higher\nSome clear segment of the total market is particularly passionate about\nthe problem or need\nPivot or Proceed\nRegardless of channel, this step concludes with the first of many pivot-orproceed discussions. Management and investors affirm they’re confident\nthey’re the company has uncovered a problem in which a sizable enough\nuniverse of customers is clearly eager to solve. If not, it’s time to rethink the\nvalue proposition and attack a more severe problem or a need of greater\ninterest or urgency to a larger customer universe. If the universe is eager to\nsolve the problem, the group moves on to present its potential product\nsolution to customers.\n...summarizing customer findings is not an\naccounting problem.\nOne last thought: Collecting and summarizing customer findings is not\nan accounting problem. You aren’t simply adding up the number of\nresponses. You’re looking for learning, meaning and insight in the data. And\nmore than anything, you’re looking for hordes of customers who will try to\nrip the product right out of your hands so they can have it before their friends\nor competitors.\nChecklist 18: Update The Business Model And\nTeam\nGoal: Prepare to assess whether to move ahead or pivot\nReference: Chapters 3,4, 5, Customer Discovery\nAssemble the Customer Data\nBuild a Workflow map of prototypical customer\nCustomer workflow with and without new product or app\nDetailed findings from customer interviews\nProblems customers have\nPain level\nHow the problems are being solved\nWhat was learned\nBiggest surprises/Biggest disappointments\nAssessment of data\nHow well preliminary product specs solve customers’ problem\nProduct/market fit\nReview and prioritize features list\nFeatures matched to customer problem\nCustomer interest/enthusiasm quantified\nReview the Phase 1 hypotheses\nUpdate the Business Model Canvas\nUpdate the 18-month delivery schedule\nPivot-or-proceed discussion\nExit criteria\nDetermine whether the company has uncovered a problem that many\ncustomers are eager to solve, or if the Value Proposition works\nUpdate the Business Model Canvas\nPass/Fail tests identified\nHigh Fidelity MVP Test\nThe “Low Fidelity MVP Test” probed the intensity of customer interest in\nthe problem or need. Now it’s time to determine whether customers will\nengage with or buy the product or use the site or app.\nThis “solution test” is not a live launch or even a “soft” launch; rather, it\nsimply invites a limited number of customers to experience the MVP (which\nis a continuously improving work in progress). That “limited number” can be\nmeasured in thousands, and if even more show up that’s a very good sign,\nsince they’ve probably been sent by friends who think highly of the solution.\nThis “solution test” is not a live launch or even a\n“soft” launch.\nLarge-scale testing isn’t the goal here. At this point, you’re opening the\n“front door” and inviting a modest number of customers in. It’s discovering\nenough passionate, enthusiastic earlyvangelists who clearly believe the\nproduct solves their problem. (Here is guidance on home and landing page\nMVP development.)\nMore than anything else, watch for the “velocity” of customer\nactivation. What’s velocity? In a car, it’s how fast it’s moving. In a\nweb/mobile business, velocity means several things, often at once:\nhow many visits before someone activates\nhow many tell their friends\nhow fast those friends activate, and\nhow quickly—and how often—visitors return\nTwo rare exceptions to this quest for velocity may be niche vertical sites\nlike “lefthandedprobowlers.com” and high-value products like enterprise\nsoftware or extravagant jewelry, where fewer high-value customers may be\njust fine.\nStealth or No?\nIt’s impossible to launch a hi-fidelity MVP test in “stealth” mode, since the\nproduct and its website are being exposed to customers and prospects to test\ntheir reactions. Customer Development and stealth are mutually exclusive. If\nyou believe your idea is so fragile that it cannot be exposed to non-employees\nwithout a signed non-disclosure agreement, you shouldn’t be reading this\nbook.\nA completely open, public site or app invites competitors, so you may\nwant to consider an “invite-only” site to control access as you test your\nsolution.\nIn most markets and industries the trade press is not investigative\njournalism (you have to set yourself on fire to get noticed). As a reminder,\nnow is not the time for press releases, interviews, blogs or public demos\n(other than to potential investors). You simply do not know enough yet to say\nwhat business you are in. If you do get noticed by the press, simply don’t\nreturn their e-mails or calls.\nChecklist 19: High Fidelity MVP Test\nGoal: Identify a test that gauges the intensity of customers’ enthusiasm for\nthe product\nReference: Chapter 5, High Fidelity MVP Test\nRun the High Fidelity “Solution” test\nInvite a limited number of customers\nNot a live launch; small scale test – by invitation only\nIncludes a call to action – “buy now,” “sign up,” “learn more”\nMeasuring Customer response\nNumber of visits before someone activates\nNumber of people who tell friends\nSpeed with which those people activate\nRate of customer return to site\nExit criteria\nSimple test for assessing customer interest in the app or site\nTactics for measuring response\nPass/Fail tests identified\nMeasure Customer Behavior\nThe high-fidelity MVP test launched in the previous step began inviting\ncustomers to engage with your product, site or app. The goal is not to sell\nthem anything (even though that may happen more than once) but instead to\ngauge the extent of their enthusiasm for the product. As customers arrive,\neach one of their actions should be measured: where they come from, what\nthey click on, what they do and how long they stay, to name a few. It’s not a\nstatistical exercise at all, but a process that begins by knowing the right\nmetrics to measure.\nPROCEED WITH CAUTION: Remember, this is an\noverview/tutorial. There’s no way you can implement all this or even\nprocess this in one sitting.\nMeasure Enthusiasm Most of All\nThese metrics are key “enthusiasm indicators” for almost any product, app, or\nsite:\nPurchase: Obviously a favorite among e-commerce and subscription sites,\nthis action is the easiest to measure if the product or service is available for\nsale, even as an MVP, at this very early stage. If not, an acceptable substitute\nis customers’ willingness to register so they can be notified when the product\nis available or simply to learn more about it.\nEngagement: Once a user visits for the first time, how often does he come\nback? Multi-sided market and other ad-supported sites need to know users\nwill come back often, generating page views that lead to revenue. If a user\ncomes back five times a day or a week, that’s promising. Five times a month\nprobably won’t deliver a scalable business. If 1,000 customers come once,\nhow many of them return often, as opposed to those who seldom or never\nreturn? Dig deep to determine the level of user engagement:\nhow often do users visit?\nhow long do they stay?\nhow active are they when using the site or app?\nWhat are the characteristics of frequent returnees (are they gear heads,\nteens, retirees or housewives)?\nCan more of them be found cost-effectively?\nAt low-engagement sites like Weather.com and bing.com, and apps like\ntip calculators or Foursquare, customers hit the app or site, find what they\nwant, and depart in a matter of moments. These sites and apps need to\nmeasure frequency of use to determine enthusiasm. If users visit once a\nmonth, they’re of little value; if they use an app dozens of times a day, it’s\nprobably a strong multi-sided market product. Low-engagement sites should\nmeasure frequency of use first.\nLook for significant visit frequency or time spent on\nthe site...\nHigh-engagement sites like multiplayer games, social networks, and rich\nniche-content sites need to look for significant time spent on the site: a solid\npercentage of visitors:\nregistering\nfilling out profiles, posting\ncomments\nuploading photos\ninviting friends to engage\nRetention: for almost any app or site, retention is a critical measure of\ncustomer enthusiasm. It’s tricky to measure retention during the customer\ndiscovery phase, when time spans are relatively short. After all, if discovery\nis under way for two months, retention can be measured for only that brief\nperiod. Look for behavior patterns. Measure both of the most obvious form of\nattrition (the opposite or enemy of retention): unsubscribes and terminations.\nInactivity is the most insidious form of attrition, particularly in mobile apps.\nPeople don’t delete the app, but they also never use it.\nReferral: Do site visitors or MVP users refer their friends?\nwhat percentage refer others?\ndo they refer one or two or six or 10?\nwhose referrals engage better than others?\nwhich referrals become heavy users or referrers?\nThe operators of freecash.com would no doubt get a near-infinite\nnumber of referrals if the site lived up to its name. Greater referral volume\nindicates enthusiasm for the product and also should point toward a lower\ncustomer acquisition cost, since many customers may come via referrals from\nother customers. Both are good indicators of success potential.\nConduct Pass/Fail Tests\nFor each test, you should have a pass/fail metric developed earlier. But look\nfor great or massive response and activity, not just a passing grade.\nThe answer to pass/fail tests is binary, by definition: Do (more than 50%\nof) customers love it? Is the product exciting to “enough” customers (insert\nyour number here) for the startup to move forward to the customer validation\nstep?\nHow many customers are “enough” is a multipart question for\nentrepreneurs, not accountants.\nDetailed spreadsheets and analyses will help immensely during\ncustomer validation, when the behavior of tens of thousands of visitors will\nbe measured in painstaking detail. For now, job No. 1 is to be sure the test is\nvalid, with the success criteria established upfront and factored into the\nbusiness model. For example, if you need to spend $50 on Facebook ads to\nget an order, that’s great if the product costs $200, but not so good if it sells\nfor $49.95. So when you “pass” a test, you’re moving closer with each\npassing grade to a successful business model.\nHow many customers are “enough” is a multipart\nquestion for entrepreneurs, not accountants.\nThe question of Earlyvangelist volume needs a convincing answer: yes,\nenough interested, passionate earlyvangelists can be found to buy the\nproduct. (They will guide product development and marketing through the\nnext stages of Customer Development.)\nDon’t stop driving people toward the product until you’re certain of:\nHow many people who expressed serious interest in the need or problem\nactually accept an invitation to explore the product, and how many\nengage or accept the call to action?\nHow many less interested or uninterested people are willing to explore\nand engage?\nFor each of those groups, how many will tell others, and how many will\nthey tell?\nAnswer each question on both an absolute and a percentage basis. If, for\nexample, 1,000 people show up, were invitations sent to 2,000 or\n200,000? The implications are obvious\nWhether via e-mail, AdWords, Twitter or carrier pigeon, each set of\ninvitations should be sent multiple times (read about e-mail cascades) for\nmaximum impact. Consider changing the messaging if traffic or engagement\nare inadequate. Otherwise, nobody will ever know if the messaging was bad\nor the product was uninteresting.\nMeasure Test Results Carefully\nIt’s crucial to measure customer behavior with the MVP itself. While user\nvolume will probably be small, measure not only the traffic and user activity\nbut also the traffic sources and acquisition and activation rates. How much\ntime did users spend with the product or on the site? Did visitors register on\nthe first, second, or third visits? Referral rates, perhaps the most critical\nmeasure of enthusiasm, should be closely measured as well. (Guidelines are\nfound in Chapter 3.)\nBut look for great responses and activity, not just a\npassing grade.\nAssemble the data and mine it deeply, looking for insights into sources\nof traffic, most or least engaged customer types, those who referred the most\ncustomers, and other clues. The data will be reviewed in depth in the next\nphase, but focus on one simple thing: have we found enough people\ninterested in the product to move forward to customer validation?\nStudy channel data: In the web/mobile product arena, channels may be\nresellers like amazon.com, an app store or iTunes or aggregator reseller\nwebsites like GameStop, CDW or yugster. Interact with these channels to\nunderstand their regulations governing new products, how long it takes from\ninitial contact until actual live sales begin on their sites, payment terms and\nmore. Since they deal with massive volumes of app and software sales, the\nexecs at these resellers can be extremely helpful on such key issues as pricing\nand positioning.\nIn the customer discovery phase, numbers themselves often aren’t strong\nor exciting. Before abandoning ship, dig deeper to determine whether the app\nor site has hit a nerve among a customer cohort or segment (teenage girls,\nfirst-time site visitors, old golfers). Mine the data from the most frequent\nusers (easy if there aren’t too many of them) to see if they share any common\ntraits. Might they all be Democrats or gourmet cooks or young urban\nprofessionals? If so, consider iterating the marketing messages and the\naudience targeting in hopes of getting far more excitement and engagement\nfrom a smaller subset of the total population.\nMulti-sided markets should also conduct initial conversations with the\nother “side” of their market: the people who will pay to reach the audience\naggregated by the site or application. How do the “payers” buy advertising?\nWhat are they willing to pay? How long does the process take, and at what\npoint should conversations begin? (Here is a more detailed discussion of the\n“other side” of multi-sided markets.)\nChecklist 20: Measure Customer Behavior\nGoal: Determine customer enthusiasm for MVP\nReference: Chapter 5, Measure Customer Behavior\nIdentify Critical Customer Metrics\nPurchase\nEngagement\nRetention\nReferral\nCohorts\nMine the Data\nTraffic sources\nAcquisition, activation rates\nCustomer engagement (time on site, number of visits before\nregistration, etc.)\nNumber of referrals\nExit criteria:\nRobust customer interest, excitement — enough to warrant moving\nforward\nPass/Fail tests identified\nUpdate the Business Model Again\n(Another Pivot-or-Proceed Point)\nHere you’ll update the business model to reflect the latest round of customer\ndiscovery “solution” findings and how they do or don’t affect the elements of\nyour business model. Think of it as a “tune up,” since you’ll conduct a\nthorough business model review in the next phase.\nYour focus here is totally about customers’ enthusiasm for the product,\nand the conversation should be about pass/fail test results, not opinions.\nFor web/mobile startups, data plays an even greater role in this\nconversation, as discussed below.\nYour business model should undergo regular\nupdates.\nLook for Massive Customer Enthusiasm\nThis is the time to remember that lukewarm response to any product or the\nproblem it solves is a serious, red-alert danger signal that calls for an\niteration or a pivot rather than an automatic step forward into customer\nvalidation. Discuss the percentages as well as the number of customers\nvisited who express rabid or significant enthusiasm for the product and high\nconfidence that it solves an important business problem or fills a high-priority\nconsumer need. What’s the team’s honest appraisal of how many customers\nwould run out and buy it immediately? How many would tell all their friends\nor associates? Did any or, better, many declare the best possible vote of\nconfidence, “I don’t care if it’s not complete or perfect—I want it now”? Start\nthe conversation by sorting customer reactions into the following main\ncategories:\nCategory 1: Customers unequivocally love the product, and no changes\nare needed.\nCategory 2: Customers like the product, but we’ve heard consistently that\nthey want this or that additional feature at launch.\nCategory 3: Customers can understand the product after a long\nexplanation, but no one was jumping over the table to buy it.\nCategory 4: Customers don’t see much of a need for the product.\nIf most of the customers fall into Category 1, congratulations! If the\nbusiness model components “add up,” as reviewed in the next step, it may\nwell be time move on to customer validation.\nRegardless of channel, customer discovery sought a market for the\nproduct as originally spec’ed. The most dangerous customer responses lie in\nCategory 2: “We need more features.” As emphasized earlier, knowing which\nfeatures don’t matter is as important as knowing which features to ship first.\nBalance customer reactions with development time, since it may take much\nmore product development effort to earn a convincing Category 1 answer.\nWhy? Because the joke is true: “Normal people believe if it isn’t broke, it\ndoesn’t need to be fixed. Engineers believe if it isn’t broke, it doesn’t have\nenough features yet.”\nThe natural instinct of Engineering is to keep adding features. But\ncustomer discovery is a race to get the MVP into paying customers’ hands as\nquickly as possible, so fewer features or an MVP that’s just “good enough”\nare far better than losing a month or even a week’s worth of customer\nfeedback. Ask whether any features can be deferred. Let early customers help\ndetermine which features and functionality to add and in what sequence.\nListening carefully to the right customers delivers a product strategy with a\nhigh likelihood of success in any channel.\nIn the web/mobile channels, the team is reviewing granular behavior\ndata from a larger universe of early customers. Qualitative discussions about\nfeatures should happen, but almost every discussion is augmented with hard,\ncold facts about customer behavior, and data is central to almost every\ndiscussion point. Some of the facts to discuss, always in absolute numbers as\nwell as percentages:\nPage views per day or week and the growth rate of those page views\nover time\nAverage time spent or page views with the site or product\n“Rate of gain,” or the time it takes people to increase time/page views on\nsubsequent visits\nNumber of repeat visits for avid and average users; time lag between\nrepeat visits and “rate of gain,” or the measurable decrease in time\nbetween visits\nNumber and percentage of invited or aware customers who were\nacquired\nConversion rates of visitors-to-acquired, acquired-to-activated, and\nactivated-to-active-users\nReferral rates and virality: number and percentage of early users who\nrefer their friends, how many they refer, and how many friends are\nacquired/activated/actively engaged\nLukewarm customer response can indicate a\nprofound problem.\nWhile the numbers are probably small in many of the categories above,\nthe discovery process is more directional than finite. To be honest, it’s a\nsearch for rampant customer enthusiasm—the kind that delivers blockbuster\nbusiness success. Determine whether there’s enough customer enthusiasm\nand positive feedback to warrant a move forward to more rigorous testing in\ncustomer validation.\nThis is where entrepreneurial experience and “gut” guide the go/no-go\ndecision. And the most convincing arguments for “go” involve statistics that\nshow lots of activation, many people visiting and coming back again and\nagain, and many more telling more and more of their friends or colleagues.\nSo while the statistics drive the conversation, the leaders’ instincts make the\ndecision. This is where seasoned entrepreneurs, advisers, and investors have\nthe potential to make important contributions.\nAnswers in Categories 3 and 4—customers aren’t jumping over the table\nor don’t see a need—are typical during a first round of customer discovery.\nAt a minimum, they require serious thought and probably a pivot that\ninvolves restarting Phase 1 from the beginning rather than continuing forward\non a death march to failure. This makes for a challenging board meeting but\nis often a critical turning point for investors and company alike. For\ntechnology products, lukewarm customer response can indicate a profound\nproblem, usually characterized as the lack of product/market fit: not enough\nof a market for the product or a lack of robust demand for a product in a vast\nmarket.\nRepackaging the Product—A Pivot Strategy\nOther issues are sometimes referred to as positioning but more accurately\ndescribed as “product repackaging.” Product repackaging is a problem most\ntechnology startups have to deal with at some point. A technology-driven\nstartup’s first product is usually determined by the founding product\ndevelopment team. Often the product development team has a perfect feel for\nwhat the customers’ needs are and how the customers want to buy the\nproduct. But most of the time they don’t. If they haven’t been intimately\nconnected to the customer, the initial product configuration needs further\nrefinement by the Customer Development team. While the core technology\nmight be spot-on, its match for customer needs or purchase preferences can\nbe off. A single monolithic software package might be too expensive or too\ncomplex to sell that way. Technology repackaging might solve the problem\nby reconfiguring the product features. Perhaps it can be sold as modules, or\nas a subscription service, or with increasingly featured versions, without\nrequiring Product Development to completely reengineer the product. This\nproblem must be caught and dealt with in customer discovery or it may affect\nthe company’s ability to survive.\nUpdate the Business Model Canvas Again\nRegardless of channel, this series of analyses and discussions will almost\ncertainly affect some of the business model hypotheses. Most likely to be\naffected is the value proposition, since this first “solution discovery” effort\nhelps shed light on whether people think the product solves the problem in a\nway that compels them to buy. When it doesn’t, the value proposition is the\nmost likely suspect for adjustment, whether features are added or subtracted\nas a result.\nCustomer segments should be reviewed, since the product may have\nresonated well with some segments and not others. If, for example, the\nproduct generates excitement only among a subset of the intended market\n(men, not women; managers, not staff people), that discovery will affect the\nrevenue stream hypothesis as well. The team will conduct a thorough review\nof the business model in the next phase, so this is best thought of as a tune-up\nthat updates the model to reflect the latest round of customer discovery\n“solution” findings.\nChecklist 21: Update The Business Model And\nTeam\nGoal: Prepare to assess whether to move ahead or pivot\nReference: Chapters 3,4, 5, Customer Discovery\nAssemble the Customer Data\nBuild a Workflow map of prototypical customer\nCustomer workflow with and without new product or app\nDetailed findings from customer interviews\nProblems customers have\nPain level\nHow the problems are being solved\nWhat was learned\nBiggest surprises/Biggest disappointments\nAssessment of data\nHow well preliminary product specs solve customers’ problem\nProduct/market fit\nReview and prioritize features list\nFeatures matched to customer problem\nCustomer interest/enthusiasm quantified\nReview the Phase 1 hypotheses\nUpdate the Business Model Canvas\nUpdate the 18-month delivery schedule\nPivot-or-proceed discussion\nExit criteria\nDetermine whether the company has uncovered a problem that many\ncustomers are eager to solve, or if the Value Proposition works\nUpdate the Business Model Canvas\nPass/Fail tests identified\nIdentify First Advisory Board Members\nAs good as any founding team may be, invaluable people outside the\ncompany who can’t be hired full time will often be willing to help in an\nadvisory capacity. These advisers can help solve technical problems,\nintroduce key customers, provide domain-specific knowledge, and share\nbusiness expertise and wisdom. Throughout customer discovery, when\nmeeting customers and analysts, prospecting for advisory board members\nshould always be in the back of everyone’s minds.\nProduct Development should engage some advisers for specific help in\ndesigning and building the product, and a business mentor, someone who’s\nbeen through the startup grind before, may also be helpful. One or two\ncustomer voices typically stand out from the crowd. Engage these people by\nasking them for advice, taking them to lunch or dinner, and seeing if they’re\ninterested in helping. Formalize the advisory board process later, during\ncustomer validation.\nRead more about the advisory board structure and organization.\nChecklist 22: Identify First Advisory Board\nMembers\nGoal: Begin to identify first advisory board members\nReference: Chapter 5, Identify First Advisory Board Members\nPotential advisors approached\nTechnical problems\nKey customer introductions\nDomain-specific knowledge\nProduct development\nPotential advisors approached\nExit criteria\nInitial list of advisory board prospects\nPass/Fail tests identified\n\nCHAPTER 6\nCustomer Discovery, Phase Four: Verify\nthe Business Model and Pivot or Proceed\nHAS YOUR CUSTOMER DISCOVERY EFFORT turned your hypotheses (or guesses)\ninto hard facts? Do you believe it’s time to proceed to customer validation,\nwhen you test whether your business model can scale?\nThere are three critical questions to answer:\n1. Have we found a product/market fit? Is there sizable demand for solving\nthe problem, and does the product fill that demand well in the\ncustomers’ eyes?\n2. Who are our customers and how do we reach them? Do we understand\nthe demography and archetypes of our key target customers and enough\nabout their behavior to know how to find them cost-effectively?\n3. Can we make money and grow the company? Can we grow predictably\nand large enough to make a great company?\nIf your answer to this analysis is “proceed,” remember that it’s still not\ntime to launch. This go/no-go decision answers only one question: do we\nhave enough confidence in customers’ enthusiasm and the product/market fit\nto proceed to customer validation and see if our business model scales by five\ntimes, 10 times or more? It’s often frustrating to entrepreneurs who make the\n“go” decision, since they’re rarin’ to get out and start doing and selling. After\nall, that’s what entrepreneurs do. It’s also a dangerous trap: customer\nvalidation accelerates spending, which—if unsuccessful—can cost you your\njob, your equity, or both. (As we’ve said, this process isn’t easy.)\nIs This Business Worth Doing? (Figure 6.1)\nBring your team and investors to a “full stop” to answer the questions\nabove. At a bare minimum, whether you Pivot or Proceed is the subject of an\nentire board meeting. Generally this assessment forces at least one return trip\nback to the start of the discovery process. This is the norm! (It’s far better to\nfind out now, before more years of 100-hour workweeks are invested.)\nThe three questions you’re answering are virtually identical,\nregardless of whether the product and channel are physical or web/mobile.\nBut web/mobile startups should have far more customer feedback and have\nimplemented more product iterations than their counterparts in the physical\nworld. Web/mobile startups should already see some measurable “velocity”\nin their rates of customer activation (which may not be as clear-cut in\nphysical channel startups). If your web/mobile startup isn’t seeing strong\nearly signs of customer activation (sign-ups, referrals, return visits, upsells),\nit’s almost certainly time to stop right here and start exploring changes to the\nbusiness model.\nHave We Found a Product/Market Fit?\nProduct/market fit has three components:\nIs the problem or need that’s addressed urgent or vital to lots of\ncustomers—i.e., is there a market? (Replace “lots” with a real “pass/fail”\nnumber.)\nDoes your product solve the problem or fill the need at a price customers\nwill gladly pay? (Insert real number from business model, of course.)\nAre there enough customers (insert number) “out there” to deliver a\nsizable (insert number) business opportunity?\nThis checkpoint is important enough to take these questions one at a\ntime. (If you’re uncertain or want more data, there’s a deeper exploration of\nthis set of questions at the end of Chapter 11.)\nAre you attacking a serious problem or filling a\ncompelling need?\nThis question should have been thoroughly probed directly with customers\nboth online and, more important, face-to-face. Have you consistently heard\nenthusiastic responses like “This is a high-priority problem (or need) near the\ntop of my list?” If they add comments like “I’d pay anything to solve this\nproblem” or “My patchwork solution isn’t good enough,” even better. Probe\nonly for a high level of consistent enthusiasm. That defines a market\nopportunity.\nKey questions to review and discuss:\nDid your customers have friends or colleagues with similar problems or\nneeds, and did they think the problem was important enough to discuss it\nwith, or refer it to, their friends or coworkers?\nWere many of the customers you met attempting home-grown or\nworkaround solutions to the problem your product will solve?\nDid most customers rate the problem or need’s severity at 8, 9, or 10 on\na scale of 10?\nDid most customers rate the pain caused by the problem at or near 5 on a\nscale of 5?\nReview the before-and-after customer work-flow diagram.\nWas the difference dramatic after buying the product?\nWere customers palpably excited?\nDid customers say they would pay for that difference?\nWeb/mobile startups should look closely at customer or user\nreferrals to gauge the problem’s magnitude and importance. If only tens or\nhundreds of users have the problem or need or nobody thinks it’s of interest\nto their friends or associates, this is an “acid test” of the problem’s\nseriousness. If inquiries from referred potential users yield few or no\nactivations, it’s equally serious. Stop and get on the phone with as many of\nthose users (nonusers, really) as possible to understand their lack of interest.\nPerhaps it’s the messaging, an easy fix. Don’t “sell” them in the call—probe\nfor their genuine interest and listen for opportunities to change the message,\nthe product, or the activation incentives.\nDoes your product solve the problem or fill the need\nfor your customers?\nReview all the customer feedback report cards, summaries, and analysis—\nthere should be quite a pile of it. Here again, as with validating the problem\nquestion, be sure there’s robust enthusiasm for the product, even in its MVP\nform. Look for comments like “I have to have this now” or “Everyone I know\nwill want one” or “When can I get it?” Lukewarm or average enthusiasm\nseldom delivers scalable startups. Be objective and park entrepreneurial\nenthusiasm at the door.\nKey questions to review and discuss:\nDid the minimum viable product generate significant “buy” or “engage”\nenthusiasm?\nWas the product exciting enough to stimulate significant customer\nreferrals? Did those referred customers buy or engage at an encouraging\nrate?\nDid the long-term product vision generate highly positive customer\nfeedback?\nIs the latest product-features-and-benefits hypothesis still appropriate\nand profitable?\nDid the long-term product-delivery schedule generate purchase\nenthusiasm?\nAlso review the delivery schedule, revising assumptions as necessary.\nCustomers are buying into the entire vision, not just the MVP, and need to\nhear how and when the product will evolve.\nOne of the telltale symptoms of a bad “solution” fit for web/mobile\nstartups is easy to spot: tons of acquisition but very little activation. Your\npotential customers agree that you’ve hit on a problem or a need they care\nabout, so they came to learn more, but when they arrived, they didn’t like\nyour proposed solution.\nCustomer feedback is vital here. First probe customers’ feelings about\nthe product, site, or app and what they liked or didn’t like about it. Then\nprobe the messaging. Did the product not deliver on the message (as in “Lose\n20 pounds tomorrow”) that got them to the site in the first place? Was it their\nlack of confidence in the product, a lack of evidence (claims, testimonials,\ndiagrams or demos), or poor messaging? Get to the bottom of these questions\nbefore proceeding, gathering as much one-on-one feedback from both\nactivators and non-activators. What led the activators to sign up? What was\nmissing in the pitch—the product, the “sales pitch” or the company that\nmight have changed the minds of non-activators?\nAre there Enough Customers to Deliver a Sizable\nBusiness Opportunity?\nDid customers verify that they’d buy at the level you expected? Did any\ncompetitive or other data emerge pointing to larger or smaller market share?\nReview your initial TAM (total addressable market) and SAM (serviceable\nmarket) hypotheses and compare those estimates with what customers\nactually said. How much do they buy, how often, and are their friends or\ncolleagues similarly inclined? Check findings against market knowledge and\ncompetitive analysis data gathered in Phase 2.\nKey questions to review and discuss:\nHave you validated the TAM and SAM for your market?\nIs the market size as you expected, and is it verified by customer\nfeedback and industry data?\nIs the market growing significantly, with strong growth prospects?\nDo customer conversations verify that they’ll buy repeatedly and refer\nothers to do the same?\nDid any unexpected competitive threats emerge?\nThe hard question to answer here is how many customers are “enough.”\nThis question must be answered by founders and investors together, with\neveryone on the proverbial “same page” about longer-term goals for the\ncompany and whether results to date point toward achieving those results.\nThese results differ widely by channel and product type. A few\ngeneralizations:\nEnterprise software: Three or four earlyvangelists showing very strong\ninterest might well be enough, provided that the team has at least as\nmany more enthusiastic prospects in the pipeline. Where possible,\ncustomers should come from multiple segments, and few or no segments\nshould be far behind the others in terms of interest in the product\nCapital equipment: The “three or four” enterprise software rule applies\nhere, too, as a rule, but a closer look at results of customer discovery\nwith a broader range of customers is helpful. Are most prospects\ninterested in the product largely as spec’ed, or does everyone want some\nform of customization? Do discovery results point to a robust pipeline,\nacknowledging that the sales cycle for capital goods can be quite lengthy\nConsumer products: Whether it’s a new skateboard or a flat-screen TV,\nmore than a handful of earlyvangelist customers is almost certainly\nrequired—perhaps 20 or 30 or more. It’s also important to establish\nserious interest in the channel where you expect to sell the product. If 15\npeople want to buy your skateboard, that’s probably not convincing\nenough for the Walmart buyer, for example\nWeb/mobile applications: Since customer discovery efforts should reach\nat least several thousand prospective users or customers, a web/mobile\napp should almost certainly activate at least 100 apps or downloads to\nsay it’s seen “enough” customer response. You should also watch the\npercentages, to be sure the conversion rate is encouraging\nSocial networks and “network effect” startups: These should probably\nattract at least 500 if not 1,000 active, engaged users to be able say\nthey’ve attracted “enough.” If the site or app is free or a freemium (freeto-paid), that number should be at least three times—preferably five\ntimes—larger, since it’s so much easier for a user to say “yes” to\nsomething that’s free. Monitor the activation rate, and look as well at the\npercentage of users who are returning regularly—say, three times a\nweek—since they’re not only an indication of customer volume but also\npoint to the customers’ quality and engagement\nIf the team is talking to the right customers but feedback says the\nproduct is wrong, something has to change. Reassess your customer segments\nand get back outside to find a different set of customers, or consider changing\nthe features, product configuration, pricing, or other business model\nelements.\nChecklist 23: Verify Product/Market Fit\nGoal: Verify that the company has identified a serious problem, has a\nproduct that will address that problem and that there are enough customers\nwilling to pay for that product.\nReference: Chapter 6, Verify Product/Market Fit\nAssessment: Serious problem or important need?\nNumber of customers with the problem\nHow customers rated problem\nWhether customers attempted home-grown solutions\nWorkflow diagram with and without new product\nAssessment: Does product addresses product or need?\nCustomer feedback reviewed\nAmount of customer enthusiasm for product\nReferral rate\nActivation/acquisition rates\nReview feedback\nReview product messaging\nAssessment: Are there enough customers?\nMarket size, now and anticipated\nCustomer feedback\nCompetitive threats\nExit criteria:\nVerify sizeable demand for solving the problem\nVerify that the product fills the demand well in the customers’ eyes\nUpdate the Business Model Canvas\nPass/Fail tests identified\nDo We Know Who Our Customers Are and How to\nReach Them?\nThe previous step assures that there are customers “out there” who want your\nproduct. But do you know how to find them and sell to them with an\naffordable marketing or “get customers” budget? This verification step starts\nby ensuring that you know “what a customer looks like.”\nCan you draw a customer archetype for each of your key customer\nsegments? Does it clearly point you to places where you can find them?\nCan you draw a day in the life of a customer so you know how to pitch\nthe product to him?\nDid some segments respond better, faster, or with larger orders than\nothers?\nDid any new segments emerge, or should any be eliminated?\nDo customers recognize big improvements in a “day in the life” of\nusers?\nDo you know what your customers read, trade shows they attend, gurus\nthey follow, and where they turn for new product information?\nCan you draw your channel map, showing how the product moves from\nyour startup to its end user, along with the costs and marketing/sales\nroles of each step in the sales channel?\nTry to measure your “get customers” cost and response rates objectively.\nReview the real, “all in” costs (including staff time, overhead, whatever) of\nactivating or selling, say, 50 customers. When you add up all the costs (not\njust the ad or AdWords costs themselves, for example), are you still confident\nof your ability to get lots more customers at roughly the same cost per\ncustomer?\nLook beyond your total “Get” budget to identify which programs were\nmost cost-effective, and do some homework to be sure that if, for example,\nyou quintupled your e-mail marketing budget, results would quintuple as\nwell. This is the time to figure out how much you really need to spend to get\none (or 50) good customer(s), since you’re about to head to customer\nvalidation, where spending will increase by a factor of 10 if not more!\nIf a significant amount of customer feedback has given you high\nconfidence in all these answers, there’s one more step—determining whether\nyou can consistently acquire customers at the costs outlined in your “Get”\nhypotheses. Your early tests of the Get programs should have given you a\ngood sense of that, so review the data collected. Don’t worry if the costs are a\nlittle high, since you’ll be optimizing those programs as you ramp them up\nduring validation.\nWeb/mobile startups should be far smarter about answers to these\nvital “Get” questions, partly because they can be. Is the response best on\nFacebook, Twitter or Foursquare? Do people who eventually activate find the\nsite or app most frequently via AdWords, textlinks, natural search or when\nthey read about it on blogs or hear about it from friends? You should know\nthis quite well based on even the earliest customer discovery testing you’ve\ndone.\nRemember to look beyond mere customer acquisition statistics and\nidentify the activated users or buyers by source so that you know where to\nfind lots more of them. Often you’ll discover that nothing works better than\nperson-to-person referrals, so look at that “Get” approach more closely. And\nalways look at the data for each customer segment or cohort separately, since\nsome customers will usually prove far easier to acquire than others.\nBe sure to update the business model based on any changes in customer\nacquisition costs discovered in this review, since they’re often the largest\ncosts your startup will confront.\nChecklist 24: Verify Who Customers Are and How\nto Reach Them\nGoal: Verify that company knows its customers and how to reach them\nReference: Chapter 6, Verify Who Customers Are\nCustomer archetypes\nDay in a Life of a Customer\nCustomer responses assessed\nCustomer behaviors, influencers assessed\nChannel map\nCosts assessed for each step of moving product\nUpdated business model reflecting changes in customer acquisition\ncosts\nExit criteria:\nDetailed understanding of who the customers are, how to reach them\nand what it costs to get them\nUpdate the Business Model Canvas\nPass/Fail tests identified\nCan We Make Money and Grow the Company?\nAssemble Revenue Model Data\nBy this point, the team has assembled a massive amount of hard data about\npricing, revenue, costs and acquisition and marketing costs, among others.\nThe data needs to be verified, with any gaps filled in along the way, which\nmay entail returning to learn more in further customer, channel, or product\ndevelopment discussions. The most important hard data to review includes:\nsummary of customer report cards, indicating potential sales revenue\nexpectations over time\nmarket size estimates\nchannel cost and revenue potential summaries\npricing plan\ncustomer acquisition costs\ndetailed information about the industry, the customers, and their\nbehavior\ncompetitive product and pricing information\nCombine this data to create an accurate net revenue forecast for at least\nthe next four quarters of the company’s existence—the customer validation\nphase—and, if possible, another year beyond that. This shouldn’t be a\nprecise, to-the-penny estimate by any means. Instead, it’s more of a rough\n“gut check” to be sure that the company will emerge from customer\nvalidation as a growing, profitable business. Take a close look at Figure 6.2, a\nhypothetical analysis of a company selling both via its own website and\nthrough a physical channel. Average cost of customer acquisition is 40% of\nrevenue in this example. The data assembly is a four-part process:\n1. Compute the “best estimate” of total gross revenue the company will\nreceive directly from customers, quarter by quarter. Review results of\ncustomer discovery report cards and “get customers” program tests as\nwell as market size estimates to estimate the company’s direct revenue\nfrom customers quarter by quarter.\n2. Next, compute the amount of channel revenue (other than direct revenue\nfor sales to end users, from which the company receives 100 percent).\nReview the channel costs (margin, rep fees, promotional costs, etc.) and\ndeduct them from channel revenues.\n3. Add the net channel revenue to the total direct revenue by quarter to\nfigure total company revenue. Deduct quarterly operating costs from the\nrevenue.\n4. Compute all the costs of acquiring customers, recognizing that they will\nmost certainly change quarter by quarter, both as the company spends\nmore money on its “get customers” effort and as it acquires customers\nmore cost-effectively.\nSample Financial Analysis (Figure 6.2)\nThe computation should deliver a reasonable rough estimate of the\ncompany’s revenue expectations across its next four (or, preferably, eight)\nquarters. Consider developing this entire exercise three different ways, using\na “good/better/ best” approach that delivers three different forecasts or\nbusiness cases: high, best guess, and worst case.\nThis analysis all by itself may stop the pivot-or-proceed process in its\ntracks, as it often does, if the computation shows the company running out of\nmoney within the year. The spreadsheet is a simple example of a rough “cash\nburn” computation that should be enough to send any smart founder back\nthrough the discovery and validation processes, considering that the company\nruns out of money 90 days from moving forward.\nLooking at an analysis like this, the founders and investors should be\nhighly nervous about proceeding to spend nearly $2 million on customer\ncreation activities. The startup in this example has several options:\nRaise another few hundred thousand dollars immediately in order just to\nsurvive the year ahead\nReduce the spending on operations or customer acquisition costs\nCut staff or reduce founder salaries until break-even is achieved\nWithout taking any of these steps, the company will clearly not survive,\nand it must return to refine its business model.\nKey questions to review and discuss:\nHave you translated market and market share findings into potential unit\nsales and revenue?\nHave you validated your pricing model with customers?\nAre volume, demand, and purchase-frequency hypotheses validated?\nWere any unanticipated channel costs uncovered, such as sales reps’\nsalaries or promotional fees?\nIf the market is multi-sided, have all costs of generating “buy”-side\nrevenue been estimated?\nDoes this rough forecast point to a scalable, profitable business with\nsubstantial exit value?\nChecklist 25: Verify Can We Make Money\nGoal: Determine whether the company can be profitable\nReference: Chapter 6, Customer Discovery, Verify Business Model/Pivot or\nProceed\nRevenue Model Data\nSummary of customer report cards, indicating potential sales revenue\nover time\nMarket size estimates\nDetailed information about the industry, customers, their behavior\nCompetitive product and pricing information\nChannel cost and revenue potential summaries\nPricing plan\nCustomer acquisition costs\nAccurate net revenue forecast for the next 4-8 quarters done three\nways (good/better/best)\nDirect revenue\nNet channel revenue\nTotal revenue\nAcquisition costs\nBasic operating costs\nCash burn\nCash at quarter end, by quarter\nExit criteria:\nReasonable rough estimate of the company’s revenue expectations\nacross next four-eight quarters\nUpdate your business model canvas\nPivot or Proceed?\nThis is either the beginning of the end or, more likely, just the end of the\nbeginning. It’s where you must acknowledge that an estimated one idea in\nthousands morphs into a scalable, profitable big company with an exit value\nof $100 million or more. The company has put a stake in the ground with a\nseries of hypotheses and tested its assumptions. Potential customers have\nvalidated the product, and a base of prospects has evolved. And all the\nlearning is captured in writing in the updated business model canvas and its\nsupporting hypothesis documents. Now it’s time to honestly assess if the\nmodified hypotheses provide a sound foundation for moving forward—not to\nlaunch—to a larger-scale test in customer validation.\nSummary questions to review and discuss:\nHave we identified a problem lots of customers will eagerly pay to have\nsolved?\nDoes our product solve these needs distinctively, cost-effectively and\nprofitably?\nIf so, do we have a sizable market and a viable, scalable and profitable\nbusiness model?\nCan we draw a day in the life of our customer before and after purchase\nof our product?\nCan we create an organizational chart of users, buyers and channels?\nThe hardest question is simple and needs an honest answer: do the\ncustomer discovery findings point to a big enough market that’s hungry for\nthe product? This is often a painful question and, sadly, more often than not\nleads back almost to the beginning of customer discovery. While it’s a defeat\nof sorts, it’s far better to confront this question honestly and candidly,\nensuring that the business model, properly executed, points to a repeatable,\nscalable, profitable business opportunity. Without one, the company faces a\npainful road to ignominy.\nExhausting as the customer discovery process is, it often requires\nmultiple iterations to fully understand the market and discover customers\nwho can’t wait to buy. However, it’s never been easy to find the Holy Grail.\nUntil you do, take everything learned in Phases 1 through 3 to heart, modify\nthe presentations, go back to Phase 1 and do it again. Try out several markets\nand users. Does the team need to reconfigure or repackage the product\noffering? If so, modify the product presentations and go back to Phase 3\n(solution presentation) and do it again.\nIf the team votes “all systems go,” there are two more steps to complete\nbefore taking a deep breath and moving forward into customer validation.\nDetermine the Validation Checkpoints\nIt’s wonderful to have lots of soft, fuzzy metrics of success, but they seldom\ndeliver success to startups. Be sure that every hypothesis has a clear,\nmeasurable “validation checkpoint” and that those checkpoints tie into the\nbusiness model. A few examples of the kinds of checkpoints to test in the\ncustomer validation phase:\nPhysical channel/business-to-business checkpoint examples:\nWe can close a sale in three meetings\nOne of six prospects will buy if we get to talk to VPs of finance\nCustomers will expand the number of users of our service by 25 percent\nafter six months\nCustomers will place an average of two orders per month\nWeb/mobile checkpoint examples:\nEvery new customer invites 10 friends, half of whom sign up\nA third of our visitors will return to the site within a week\nA quarter of our visitors will refer an average of 1.5 friends within a\nweek\nAverage session duration will be 10 pages or minutes per visit\nAverage order size will be $50 in the customer’s first month\nOne hundred websites will promote traffic to our site at a CPM of less\nthan $X\nOne hundred websites will run our banners on a CPA basis\nOn to Customer Validation? Congratulations!\nIf you’ve gotten this far, you’ve changed your hypotheses many times. Some\nwere iterations, others were pivots. One of the best techniques to see how far\nyou’ve come is to show the canvases as a series of snapshots over time. You\ncan do this by putting them up on the wall or clicking through a series of\nPowerPoint slides. Either way, this visual presentation of the hypotheses and\nyour tests to turn those guesses into hard, cold facts, is the final step in\ndetermining whether it’s time to move on to the next of the four steps,\ncustomer validation.\nIf it’s time to move to the next step, congratulations! This is a major\nachievement and warrants celebration. Customer discovery is the most\nchallenging, powerful step you’ll encounter in Customer Development:\ndefining a product, an offer, a channel and pricing for a product that\nconsumers are eager to buy. Hold on to all the information collected from\ncustomer interviews for use throughout the phases of customer validation,\nwhen actual selling will develop a sales roadmap for the company.\nCustomer discovery is an exhausting, sometimes-frustrating process.\nHowever, it’s the foundation of Customer Development and thus the\nfoundation of a successful, scalable business. The checklists found\nthroughout this book recap the phases of this step, the goals of each phase,\nand the deliverables proving that the goals have been met. With that done,\ntake a well-earned vacation or a long weekend to celebrate. You’ll need to\nrest up before moving on to customer validation.\nChecklist 26: Verify Business Model – Pivot or\nProceed\nGoal: Assess whether the modified hypotheses provide a solid foundation for\nmoving forward to larger-scale testing in Customer Validation\nReference: Chapter 6, Customer Discovery, Verify Business Model/Pivot or\nProceed\nModified hypotheses assessed\nProblem/need identified\nProduct solves product/need\nSizeable market\nViable, scalable, profitable business model\nDay in the Life of the Customer, with and without product\nOrganizational chart of users, buyers and channels\nClear, measurable Validation Checkpoints identified\nExit criteria: Full, honest assessment of Customer Discovery effort:\nIs there a big enough market that’s hungry for the product?\nIII\nStep Two:\nCustomer Validation\nChapter 7:\nIntroduction to Customer Validation\nChapter 8:\nCustomer Validation, Phase One:\n“Get Ready to Sell”\nChapter 9:\nCustomer Validation, Phase Two:\n“Get Out of the Building and Sell!”\nChapter 10:\nCustomer Validation, Phase Three:\nDevelop Product and Company Positioning\nChapter 11:\nCustomer Validation, Phase Four:\nThe Toughest Question of All: Pivot or Proceed?\nOverview of the Customer Validation Process\n\nCHAPTER 7\nIntroduction to Customer Validation\nAlong the journey we commonly forget its goal.\n—Friedrich Nietzsche\nE.PIPHANY’S FOUNDING HYPOTHESES WERE typically pretty straightforward\nand “investable” in the mid-1990s, when software companies were\nautomating everything from accounts payable to network security, sales force\nprocesses and even wine-cellar inventories. “Why not automate the marketing\ndepartment?” asked the founders, meeting in their modest living room. “After\nall, most of the tasks like press releases and data sheets and customer letters\nare repeatable processes.” Venture capital was raised and the company began\nto build its product based on the founders’ vision.\nHowever, the company’s initial idea of who the customer was and the\nproblem they wanted to solve was just plain wrong. The company’s later\nsuccess was due to the four passionate entrepreneurs’ willingness to listen to\ncustomers and to the three painful pivots driven by customer feedback.\nThe Browser Breakthrough\nDuring the ’90s, large corporations acquired different software applications to\nautomate each part of their enterprise—finance, customer support,\nmanufacturing, and sales among them. But the data these applications\ncollected were accessed via reporting tools from the IT organization. More\nimportant, the data existed in “virtual silos,” with each functional system\nwalled off from the other. The finance system didn’t talk to the sales system,\nwhich didn’t know that the manufacturing system even existed. Queries like\n“Compare the sales data of green dresses versus blue ones with current\ninventory for each by store, and contrast the gross margin by region to\ncalculate discounts” were virtually impossible to answer to because they\nrequired combining data from three incompatible applications. As a result, it\ncould often take days or even weeks to get a simple inventory-detail report.\nE.piphany’s then-radical notion was to provide managers\nanytime/anywhere drill-downs and analysis in real time, without IT, through\na revolutionary new technology called a web browser. One of the company’s\nkey hypotheses was that the product should be a great fit for companies with\nlots of customers, tons of data on each one, and a recurring need for fast new\ndata-driven, microsegmented marketing campaigns.\nAn Epiphany at E.piphany\nEarly on, E.piphany assembled an advisory board. A key adviser was the VP\nof database marketing at Schwab. She was incredibly generous with her time\nand said the system might work in their application. She introduced the\ncompany to five other database marketing executives, who essentially said,\n“If you get a system working at Schwab, we’ll have to buy one as well.” You\ncouldn’t get much better than that. E.piphany had found its first\nearlyvangelist and first market.\nBut each time Schwab’s people looked at the system’s technical details,\nthey politely said our product was missing a key feature for database\nmarketing. It took two meetings before the founders realized they understood\nher problem, all right, but the solution—the underlying database schema of\nthe software—was missing the most important feature for solving it. It didn’t\ninclude “householding,” and without this feature, she could never buy the\nE.piphany system. (Householding, well-known among database marketers,\nrecognizes that two or more people at the same physical address live together\nand, in Schwab’s case, often invest together. This feature was crucial to\ndirect-marketers who didn’t want to send multiple or differing ads to the\nsame address.) And no amount of sales and marketing hand-waving was\ngoing to fix the problem.\nIt was a major mistake. Until this meeting, the founders hadn’t\nunderstood the customer problem well enough to provide the correct solution.\nE.piphany’s co-founders, Ben Wegbreit and Steve Blank, joined the\nSchwab VP, and her engineering team in a deep technical discussion of what\nthe software needed to do for Schwab’s business and what was needed. Ben\nasked five or 10 questions, everybody nodded and the meeting ended. On the\nlong ride back to E.piphany’s living-room office, Steve asked, “Ben, how do\nwe solve Schwab’s problem?”\nAfter a moment of silence, he replied, “Show them page 6 of our\nproduct spec.”\n“What do you mean page 6? Our spec only has five pages!”\nBen looked at Steve and smiled. “Not anymore.”\nThey had just pivoted the product and refined the minimum feature set.\nE.piphany’s first order from Schwab came the week after they demo’ed\nhouseholding. Other orders followed soon after. A week later, the founders\nsat down to figure out what other feature they would toss out to make room\nfor this one.\nE.piphany would go through two additional equally painful pivots\nbefore its initial public offering, but that “householding” pivot sold the\nfounders on the “power of the pivot” value.\nThe meeting and car ride from Schwab to the company headquarters\nillustrates the customer validation process every startup needs: a method for\nvalidating the business model with real customers and orders.\nCustomer validation turns hypotheses into facts about basic questions\nlike:\n• Do we understand the sales/user acquisition process?\nIs it repeatable?\nCan we prove it’s repeatable? (If our business model is single-sided\ncommerce, the only acceptable proof is enough full-price orders.)\nCan we get these orders/users with the current product?\n• Have we tested sales and distribution channels?\n• Are we confident we can scale orders/users into a profitable business?\n• Have we correctly positioned the product and the company?\nThe Customer Validation Philosophy\nCustomer validation attempts to “test sell” at every stage. It runs a continuing\nseries of quantitative pass/fail tests to determine whether there’s strong\nenough product/market fit to justify scaling sales and marketing spending.\nMost of your testing effort will be asking people to give you an order or\nengage with your app or website. At this point, you’re testing the entire\nbusiness model, not its individual components, even as you learn more details\nabout some, like price or channel.\nJust as customer discovery was disorienting for experienced marketers,\nthe customer validation process turns the world upside down for experienced\nsalespeople and, in particular, those with sales responsibility. All the rules\nsales executives learned while selling in physical channels at large companies\nare not applicable to startups. In fact, they’re positively detrimental. It’s not\nall about the launch party!\nIn the customer validation step, you are not going to hire and staff a\nsales team. You are not going to execute to a sales plan or “the sales\nstrategy.” The reality is that you don’t know enough yet to do any of these\nthings. At the end of customer discovery, you have in hand firm hypotheses\nabout who will buy, why they will buy, and at what price they will buy. But\nuntil those hypotheses are validated—with customer orders—they’re all little\nmore than educated guesses, even with the work invested to develop them.\nFrom Business Model Canvas to the Sales Roadmap\nIn customer discovery you tested some of the hypotheses of your business\nmodel:\nValue proposition: You affirmed it with a few dozen to a few hundred\npeople\nCustomer segments: You have a hypothesis about customer archetypes\nCustomer relationships: You tested several “get, keep and grow”\nactivities\nChannel: You understand your key channel partners, and some have\nexpressed interest\nRevenue model: The company has an idea of how to price its offering\nA sales roadmap uses all you’ve learned from customer discovery to\nguide the creation of a sales funnel specifically for your company. It answers:\nWho influences a sale? Who recommends a sale?\nWho is the decision-maker? Who is the economic buyer? The saboteur?\nWhere is the budget for purchasing the type of product you’re selling?\nHow many sales calls are needed to make one sale?\nHow long does an average sale take from beginning to end?\nWhat is the selling strategy? Is this a solution sale?\nIf so, what are “key customer problems?”\nWhat’s the profile of optimal visionary buyers, the earlyvangelists every\nstartup needs?\nWhere will the traffic come from? Will it stick?\nWill the product be strong enough to grow virally?\nUnless a company has proven answers to these questions, few sales will\nhappen, and those that do occur will result from heroic single-shot efforts. Of\ncourse, on some level, most sales VPs realize they lack the knowledge they\nneed to draw a detailed sales roadmap, but most believe they and their newly\nhired sales team can acquire this information while simultaneously selling\nand closing orders. This is because most executives new to startups confuse\nsearching for a business model with the execution of a known business model.\nA sales roadmap is part of the search for a business model. Only after it’s\nbuilt can it be executed. Startups can’t learn and discover while they’re busy\nexecuting. As we can see from the rubble of any number of failed startups,\nattempting to execute before you have a sales roadmap in place is pure folly.\nBuilding a Sales Roadmap Versus Building a Sales\nForce\nGiven how critical the validation step is, a CEO’s first instinct is to speed up\nthe process by spending more on customer acquisition or adding salespeople.\nThe reality is, this doesn’t speed up the validation phase. In fact, it most often\nslows it down. Instead, you’ll build a roadmap to figure out how to get\nrepeatable sales (by explicitly testing product/ market fit). Once that’s done,\nthen build a sales organization.\nDeveloping a sales roadmap is part of the search for\na business model.\nIn an existing market, customer validation may simply validate that the\nsales VP’s rolodex or contact list is relevant, and that product performance\nmetrics the company identified in customer discovery were correct. In a resegmented, clone or new market, even a rolodex of infinite size (or tripling\nthe AdWords budget) won’t substitute for a proven business model and a\ntested sales roadmap.\nFor an experienced sales or business development executive, these\nstatements about customer validation are heretical. All the actions in\nCustomer Development we consider to be mistakes are what traditional sales\nprofessionals have been trained to do. It seems counterintuitive and\ndisorienting. So let’s look more closely at why the first sales in a startup are\nso different from later-stage sales or selling in a large company.\nFounders Must Lead the Customer Validation\nTeam\nFounders who complete customer discovery often mistakenly ease up and\ndelegate customer validation activities to Sales, Business Development,\nMarketing or Product Management. This is a bad idea. Middle and junior\nmanagers aren’t likely to be good at customer validation, which requires\ncreative searching, probing, and turning on a dime—not execution of a\nrepeatable process.\nWhy must the founders lead? First, founders and only founders call the\nshots on pivoting. To do so, they must hear about flaws in the product or\nbusiness model directly from the customers. Nothing else has the same\nimpact. Anyone other than a founder who learns of a serious product or\nbusiness-plan flaw faces two challenges: he or she doesn’t have the authority\nto pivot, and he or she seldom has the courage to report bad customer\nfeedback to the founder.\nIn web/mobile channels, where there’s much more feedback to\nprocess, the founders still make the call about pivots, but the company needs\nto have data junkies, A/B testers, statisticians, and SEO/PPC experts, as well\nas at least one or two wildly creative online marketers. (This might be\nphysically embodied in the founder and one or two amazing people.) This\nteam will measure, assess, manage and improve the acquisition, or Get\nCustomers, funnel. As they’re getting “out of the building” digitally, a\ncustomer development team also leaves physically for face-to-face customer\nvalidation, and for deal-making that drives traffic or referrals.\nValidation Proceeds at Different Speeds in Different\nChannels\nIt takes far more time to set up visits in a physical channel with prospects in\ncellphone companies in Asia and Africa than to get customer feedback\nelectronically for a website. And more customers can be reached via\nweb/mobile channels than can ever be met face-to-face.\nCustomer validation for web/mobile startups always proceeds faster\nwith many more iterations than it does with physical channels and goods.\nWhy? It’s all bits that can be changed. Regardless of speed, the fundamental\nprinciples of customer validation are identical across all channels.\nMake Early Sales to Earlyvangelists\nIn customer validation you will target Earlyvangelists as your first paying\ncustomers. (If you can’t sell to them, it doesn’t get better over time.)\nConstrain Spending in Customer Validation\nA typical failure scenario for startups is premature scaling, when there are\nmore salespeople in the field burning cash than are needed while your\nbusiness model is still unproven. Or running expensive demand-creation\nactivities before you’re sure who your customers really are. Too often those\nsales people are fired and their marketing programs killed when the startup\nfaces a major pivot after scaling too early. Customer validation delays salesand-marketing hiring and spending until validation is nearly complete. This\nconstraint is central to the process, which assumes startups will fail and\niterate often. The spending constraint keeps enough cash in the bank to fund\nmultiple pivots on the road to success.\nPrioritize What Needs to be Validated\nPrioritizing the business model elements that need validating is essential at\nthe start of customer validation. Every startup business model has a zillion\nmoving parts. Validation can’t possibly measure and affirm every variable or\nthe founders will be 100 years old by the time they’re ready to scale—or,\nworse, exit—the business.\nThe business model canvas is an excellent guide here. Most startups will\nfocus on the four core elements: value proposition, customer relationships,\nchannel, and revenue model. This list works for many businesses but not all.\nMulti-sided markets need to prioritize all sides of the market. Think about the\nfive or fewer things that will make this a huge, successful business—or not.\nWhy Accountants Don’t Run Startups\nWith all the process steps involved, it’s sometimes hard to remember that the\nCustomer Development process isn’t a giant focus group. The goal is not to\nadd up all the customer feedback and vote on what features to implement.\nFounders who are artists at heart run startups—the true purpose of Customer\nDevelopment is to inform their vision. (In a new market, there’s no data at\nall!) A great entrepreneur may consider all the customer data, listen to his\ninstincts and say, “Here’s why I’m going to ignore what we just heard.”\nAnd Finally: Don’t Be Afraid to Let Go When\nLightning Strikes\nOccasionally, fast-scaling web/mobile startups with viral or network-effect\ndrivers find the business suddenly blasting off, even if this book doesn’t\nsuggest that it should happen yet. This occurred at Google, YouTube,\nFacebook, and Twitter, to name an elite few. If you’re lucky enough to hit a\nconsumer nerve as hard as they did, put this book down and hold on to the\nrocket ship. After all, that’s what entrepreneurs do! (Skim the book another\ntime on your private jet or yacht or Sunfish.)\nThe Customer Validation Philosophy, in Summary\nCustomer discovery first tested your hypotheses about the company’s\nbusiness model with a relatively tiny group of customers who were asked for\nopinions, not orders. Discovery itself didn’t deliver any proven, hard facts\nabout who would buy or how scalable the business was.\nCustomer validation goes to the next step and determines whether a\nproduct/market fit can be validated by orders or usage. It does so by further\ndeveloping the MVP as well as the company’s sales and marketing plans and\nmaterials. Then it gets founders out of the building (physically, virtually, or\nboth) to test the MVP and every other key business model hypotheses,\nincluding product features, pricing, channel, and positioning. How? By\nasking for orders (or downloads, logons, or clicks)!\nTest the MVP. How? By asking for orders.\nCustomer validation is complete when the company has answers to these\nthree questions:\n1. Can the business scale? Will a dollar spent on customer acquisition\nyield more than a dollar’s worth of incremental revenue, page views,\ndownloads or clicks?\n2. Is there a repeatable and scalable sales roadmap? Does the company\nknow the right prospects to call on or acquire, and what to say to them to\nconsistently deliver sales?\n3. Is the sales funnel predictable? Do the same sales programs and tactics\nconsistently deliver an adequate, profitable flow of customers through\nthe funnel?\nNow let’s get started.\nOverview of the Customer Validation Process\nCustomer Validation: Overview of the Process (Figure 7.1)\nCustomer Validation has Four Phases\nPhase 1 consists of six “get ready to sell” activities; product positioning,\nsales/ marketing materials for “test selling” efforts, the hiring of a sales\ncloser, the creation of a distribution channel plan, refining a sales roadmap,\nand creating an advisory board. These activities make your team the best\nprepared early stage venture ever to hit the streets.\nCompanies in web/mobile channels also have six “get ready to sell”\nactivities: Product Positioning, assembling Acquire/Activate Plans, building\nthe high-fidelity MVP, building the metrics toolset, hiring a “data chief” and\ncreating an advisory board. They help deliver lean, cost-effective customer\nacquisition programs.\nPhase 2 gets founders out of the building to put the product to the ultimate\ntest: will customers validate your business model by buying your product?\nYou’ll attempt to actually sell customers an unfinished and unproven product\nwithout a professional sales organization. Getting feedback is as important as\ngetting orders. Startups in the physical channel do this with brochures,\nPowerPoints, sales materials and, where possible, product demos or mockups.\nDozens if not hundreds of meetings help refine the product presentation and\nchannel plans, validate the sales roadmap, prove the predictability of the sales\nfunnel, and validate that the business model is repeatable, scalable and\nprofitable in a real-world test.\nWeb/mobile startups “go live” and get out of the building virtually to\nsee if their plans and tools to acquire customers actually attract customers\nwho activate or buy. Do more than a handful of real customers behave as the\nhypotheses suggest they will? Acquisition and activation activities are\nmeasured and optimized.\nStartups in multi-sided markets (physical or web/mobile) need to get out\nof the building to test each side of the market. Web/Mobile marketers first\ntest users and then validate a different set of hypotheses (value proposition,\nsegment, revenue model, etc.) with the “payers,” who are marketers or\nadvertisers willing to pay to reach people using the site for free.\nPhase 3 happens once you have a couple of orders under your belt and\nenough customer information to develop and refine your product and\ncompany positioning. The positioning is tested in meetings with industry\npundits and analysts and face-to-face with the expanded customer audience.\nWeb/mobile startups refine their “Get” program tactics. Then they\nconduct initial product positioning, next they gather and organize the\ncustomer behavior data collected in Phase 2: customer responses to “Get”\nactivities and metrics summarizing their initial on-site behavior. They collect\nfeedback about the MVP itself and the effectiveness of acquisition tools.\nPhase 4 stops all activity for long enough to conduct a detailed pivot-orproceed analysis and verify that, regardless of channel, customer validation is\ncomplete and the company knows how to scale. If so, it’s ready to reap the\nrewards for founders and investors alike. But first there are lots of tough\nquestions and hard work to verify.\nIn sum, the question is simple: “is this a business worth doing,” and\ndevoting several years of backbreaking work? Will it generate enough\nrevenue, growth and profits to achieve the founders’ and investors’ goals?\nAnd has the team learned enough to make it happen?\nOdds are overwhelming that the optimum business model won’t be\nfound on the first or second try in validation.\nThe moment customer validation is over is when it’s clear that there are\nreal orders, users, or clicks—not surveys or chats. Customer validation\nconfirms that customers will accept the minimum viable product, proves that\nthe customers exist, figures out how to reach them predictably, and crafts a\nscalable plan to engage and sell many more. It’s often called the “epiphany\nmoment.”\n\nCHAPTER 8\nCustomer Validation, Phase One: “Get\nReady to Sell”\nPHASE 1 OF CUSTOMER VALIDATION PREPARES the tools to test the company’s\nability to acquire customers. In this phase, you’ll craft your product\npositioning, which guides how you write the marketing, and online materials\nneeded for the sales effort. For companies in the physical channel, other steps\nin this phase include development of collateral materials, channel sales plans,\nand a sales roadmap. Sometimes, a “sales closer” is also hired at this point.\nAnd you’ll finalize your advisory board.\nWeb/mobile channel startups develop their plans and tools for\ncustomer acquisition and activation as well as a dashboard or toolset for\nmonitoring the results. They create a hi-fidelity MVP to be sure the\nacquisition efforts are valid.\nSteps in this first phase are markedly different for each channel, so\nphysical and web/mobile channels are addressed separately, as outlined in\nFigure 8.1.\nWhen all these steps are in place, it’s time to get out of the building and\nstart selling, in Phase 2. Here are the steps each channel requires before you\nare ready to sell.\nPhase 1 – Get Ready to Sell (Figure 8.1)\nGet Ready to Sell: Craft Positioning Statement\nFrom your customer’s perspective, what does your company stand for, what\ndoes your product do, and why should they care? You probably had an idea\nwhen you started the company, but now you have some real experience in\ninteracting with customers. It’s time to revisit the product vision, features and\ncompetitive information in light of what you’ve learned in customer\ndiscovery.\nCan you reduce all that you’ve learned into a single clear, compelling\nmessage explaining why your company is different and the product is worth\nbuying (or spending time with). That’s the goal of a unique selling\nproposition. A unique selling proposition builds the bond between you and\nyour customer, focuses marketing programs, and becomes the focal point for\nbuilding the company. More relevant for this step, it gets the company’s story\ndown to a short “elevator pitch” powerful enough to raise a customer’s heart\nrate. It’ll appear in lots of different places from billboards to banners and\nbusiness cards from here on out and helps focus sales and marketing efforts.\nDon’t worry about getting it perfect, because it will change with feedback\nfrom customers, analysts, and investors. For now, take a first best shot.\nWhile positioning messaging seems straightforward, it can be a\nchallenge to execute. It takes serious work to get to a pithy statement that’s\nboth understandable and compelling. It’s much easier to write (or think) long\nthan to write (or think) short. Start by revisiting what customers said they\nvalued during customer discovery. What were the top problems? Did a phrase\nkeep coming up to describe the problem or solution? Where does the product\naffect customers most? How significant is the product’s impact? What does\nthe new offering provide that competitors can’t or won’t? What does it do\nbetter? Think simple and short at all times. This may be a place where outside\ncreative resources are worth the investment.\nIn technology startups, one of the biggest challenges for engineers is to\nrealize the need for a simple message that grabs customers’ hearts and\nwallets, not their heads and calculators. It’s not about the product features.\nSeek a simple sentence that condenses the entire value proposition into a few\npithy, catchy words that say it all: “Think Different,” from Apple; “Don’t\nLeave Home Without It,” American Express; “Just Do It,” Nike; “We Try\nHarder,” Avis; “Earth’s First Soft Drink,” Perrier; “The Ultimate Driving\nMachine,” BMW.\nThe exercises, in Figures 8.2 and 8.3, developed by Geoffrey Moore (of\nCrossing the Chasm fame) early in his career as a marketing consultant, can\nhelp evoke the necessary elements:\nProduct Positioning Statement (Figure 8.2)\nHere’s how a mobile expense-reporting application, Mobiledough, might\nhave used the product position statement:\nProduct Positioning Statement Example (Figure 8.3)\nWhat might Mobiledough’s tag line be? A few candidates:\n“Your dough, on the go. Fast, accurate, online”\n“Track your expenses while you’re makin’ tracks”\n“Mobiledough. It just adds up, instantly, online”\nUse the Geoff Moore outline or one like it to brainstorm positioning\nstatements with the Customer Development team. Consider a companywide\ncontest or creative session. To see if the positioning is emotionally\ncompelling, think about the following:\nDo customers’ heart rates go up after they hear it?\nDo they lean forward to hear more? Or do you get a blank stare?\nIs it understandable in the users’ language or unique in their minds?\nFor B-to-B products, does the positioning imply a cost or competitive\nadvantage for the product?\nFor consumer products, does it save time or money or provide fun or\nlove, glamour or status?\nFinally, does the positioning pass the reality test? Claims like “lose 30\npounds in a week” or “increase sales 200 percent” or “fall in love tonight”\nstrain credibility and probably legality as well. Moreover, it’s not only the\nclaim that needs to pass this test. Is your company a credible supplier for the\nproduct you’re describing? When selling to corporate customers, there are\nadditional hurdles to think about. Are your capabilities congruent with your\nclaims?\nOne last thing to keep in mind is our continual question about what\nmarket type you’re in. If you’re offering a product in an existing market, your\nunique selling proposition is about better, faster, or higher performance. It’s\nframed by what you’ve learned from countless customer interviews about the\nbasis of competition..\nIf you’re creating a new market or trying to reframe an existing one,\nyou’ll probably come up with a transformational unique selling proposition.\nTransformational unique selling propositions deal with how the solution will\ncreate a new level or class of activity—i.e., something people could never do\nbefore.\nChecklist 27: Craft Company Positioning\nGoal: Create a clear, compelling message explaining why your company is\ndifferent and the product is worth buying\nReference: Chapter 8, Customer Validation Phase 1: “Get Ready to Sell”\nMessage statement\nCondenses Value Proposition into single phrase or sentence\nEmotionally compelling\nCredible\nTakes Market Type into account\nExit criteria:\nA short, pithy message that explains what the company stands for, what\nthe product does and why customers should buy from it, trust it, and\ncare\nGet Ready to Sell: Acquire/Activate Customers\nPlan\nIn customer discovery, you developed a rough plan to acquire and\nactivate customers. Now it’s time to refine those plans and build the\nacquisition and activation programs and tools. As a reminder:\nAcquisition is where prospects first learn about, experience, or visit the\nproduct, site or app. This is the widest point in the company’s sales\nfunnel and the customer’s first interaction with the company\nActivation gets newly acquired customers to sign up, participate or buy,\nor at the very least to identify themselves and move through the “Get”\nfunnel\nRemember that “Get” activity is very different in web/mobile: you must\nattract customers to your site, app, or product or they won’t even know you\nexist! Review this section, which, in brief, says: figure out where your\ncustomers go when they’re searching for a solution; be visible and inviting in\nas many of those places as possible; and “earn” their visit to your product\nwith helpful, friendly information, not hard-boiled sales pitches.\nPROCEED WITH CAUTION: Remember, this is an overview.\nThere’s no way you can implement all this or even process it in one\nsitting. It’s a plan. Implementation happens later.\n“Get Customers” Tools for Web/Mobile Channels (Table 8.1)\nThe “Acquire” Plan and Tools\nThe Acquire plan is short, to-the-point, and tactical in nature. The plan helps\nyou find tools that predictably deliver large numbers of “good” customers\n(who engage with or spend heavily on the site or app) into the widest point of\nthe funnel (at the left) at the lowest cost per customer.\nThe “Get Customers” Funnel in Web/Mobile Channels (Figure 8.4)\nWARNING: There is no possible way you can read, process and act on\nthis section in one read. There’s a lot here. Skim it first, then go back\nand read each section. Then think about what action you need to take for\nyour startup.\nThe Acquire plan (see sample plan) should fit on a single page. It details\nthe first set of Acquire activities to test and includes:\nWho: Who’s responsible for driving the program; who will add support\nor expertise\nWhat: Describe the tactic and its parts (see below for a list of tools)\nBudget: Estimate of spending for the first round of testing\nTiming: Outline the steps needed to launch (our example in Figure 8.5\nuses a four-week cycle)\nWhy: Specific, measurable acquisition goals of each plan element\nMulti-sided or not: Do you have users, or users and payers?\nThe acquire plan and tactics will change repeatedly, since in customer\nvalidation they’re basically a series of experiments.\nThe acquire plan and tactics will change\nrepeatedly... they’re basically a series of\nexperiments.\nIn a physical consumer channel like Walmart, marketers seldom know\nwhich consumers see, touch, or buy any particular product. But in the\nweb/mobile channels, every aspect of consumer behavior can be\ninstrumented, analyzed and, often as not, optimized to improve business\nperformance. Be sure your product is instrumented to track every consumer\naction or inaction. Without building the instrumentation upfront, optimizing\nyour acquisition activities is more challenging, if not downright impossible.\nA Sample Acquire Spreadsheet\nShown in Figure 8.5 is a sample of part of an Acquire plan for a web startup\nwith a small budget. The plan is built around a few key assumptions:\nWho: Two staffers are needed, one full-time and one half-time\nWhat: The tactics, chosen by the team, seem best-suited to maximizing\nleads and sales (see next section for a list of tools)\nBudget: The startup has about $25,000 to spend for this\nA Sample Acquire Plan and Timetable (Figure 8.5)\nTiming: The team is allowing itself four weeks to prepare all elements for\nthe launch of validation\nWhy: The goal is to get 30,000 to 35,000 customers to download a free\ntrial and to get 15 percent of them to convert to paying customers. This\nwould achieve a customer acquisition cost of about $5, as suggested in\nthis plan’s revenue model hypothesis\nMulti-sided or not?: Does your product have both users and payers? If so,\na multi-sided market requires a separate plan for each “side” of its\nmarket. Users will be acquired one way, while reaching and selling\nadvertisers will demand a totally different approach. (Our sample is a\nsingle-sided market)\nGuidelines for Developing the Acquire Plan\nDetermining whom to acquire (i.e., which customers,) what promotional\ntactics to use, and what to say and how to say it (the content and messaging)\nis made easy because you did most of the research and planning in customer\ndiscovery. Start this plan by referring back to three hypothesis documents\nyou devised when you created and tested your original business model canvas\nhypotheses:\nCustomer segments: customers to be reached (which guides e-mail,\ntargeting of marketing activities, ads, and PR)\nCustomer relationships: how customers will be reached (SEO, PPC, email, PR, etc.)\nValue proposition: what will excite customers and persuade them to\nengage, visit or buy\nDon’t be afraid to update or change the hypotheses based on the latest\nfeedback or even instinct at this point, since they’re still just “best guesses”\nconfirmed by only a few customers. Other guidelines to keep in mind:\nRemember that this is a test to figure out which tools work and costeffectively when they’re launched during customer creation, the next\nstep. This is not a company or product launch. Your goal is learning, not\nrevenue, so don’t be afraid to test lots of alternatives\nDefine success upfront for each test, using a pass/fail metric (such as\n“one in five people will click”), and monitor results\nBe the greatest, friendliest, coolest thing going. Your job is to attract or\ninvite customers to your product, site, or app, so be interesting and\nwelcoming (and, if appropriate, even fun or funny) rather than not just\noffering a hard, cold sale. Think like your customers, and be prominent\nand visible where you think they’ll be searching for a solution like\nyours. (Think about forums and online communities)\nRunning tests without collecting data is a cardinal\nsin.\nInstrument everything. Running tests without collecting data is a\ncardinal sin. Engineering needs to spend the extra effort to collect all\ncustomer behavior data so it can be measured and optimized\ncontinuously. Confront this upfront, as it’s hard to “bolt on” later\nDon’t start everything at once, since that will create chaos both in the\nmarket and in the company. For example, start search engine\noptimization and pay-per-click tests on Day Five, and add e-mail and\naffiliate marketing programs two or three weeks later. The individual,\nprogram-by-program results will be easier to identify and measure\nDon’t spend more than $2,000 or, if well-funded, $10,000 to test any\none thing. The startup usually can’t afford it at this stage, and the risks\nof guessing wrong are too great\nWhen a test seems to be working, ramp it up to be sure it withstands the\ntest of scale. If a $2,000 e-mail marketing campaign is performing,\ndouble it, refine it and do it again\nChoose agency partners very carefully, if at all. The costs and\nmanagement time needed to hire a pr, ad, or web agency this early in\nyour startup make it a very risky proposition. Most often, agencies are\ngreat at execution of programs but not at developing and testing\nstrategies. Rely on founders and staff where possible, as they know the\nproduct and the business model best. Consider freelance talent\nspecialized in developing tests and strategies or those who specialize in\nspecific tasks (e.g., pay-per-click, demos and other specialized skills) if\nthey don’t exist within the company\nDon’t launch the Acquire effort by itself. Activation programs must be\nready to “catch” the customers you’ve acquired, so if there’s copy\nsaying, “Sign up today and get a free box of chocolates,” for example,\nthe site’s back-end system has to be operating, the chocolates have to be\nready to ship, and copy for the thank-you e-mail must be ready to go. If\nyou’re taking customers’ money, all back-end systems need to be\nworking, including such elements as receipts, credit-card processing,\nand customer service. Similarly, site and app instrumentation must be up\nand running, tested and feeding the management dashboard so it can\nmeasure the behavior of every customer who passes through the funnel.\nRemember that acquisition by itself is one of several integrated pieces of\nthe “Get” strategy (there’s also activation, retention, and “grow\ncustomers,” to name a few).\nThe acquisition plan is managed through close monitoring of every step\ncustomers take as they move through the sales or “get customers” funnel.\nThat monitoring, generally in a dashboard, enables constant effort to improve\nperformance or “throughput”—customers movement from one step to the\nnext—at every step of the funnel, using tools detailed in the next section,\n“optimizing the acquire plan.”\nAcquire Plan Tools\nAcquisition tools you can buy\nThe list of customer acquisition tools you can buy and use is virtually\nendless, but their customer impact and effectiveness vary over time.\nAcquisition is a numbers game based on your ability to cost-effectively\ndeliver large volumes of customers to your site or app. Basic tools include:\nsearch-engine marketing\ne-mail marketing\noutreach to bloggers\naffiliate marketing\nonline lead generation\ncustomer incentives\nUse the web (and www.steveblank.com) to identify the latest\ninnovations and to select vendors. Most tools are discussed in detail in\nCustomer Relationships.\nWARNING: There is no possible way you can read, process and act on\nthis section in one read. There’s a lot here. Skim it first, then go back\nand read each section. Then think about what action you need to take for\nyour startup.\nAcquisition Tools You Engineer Into Your Product\nIn addition to the tools you buy and deploy, build social network and viral\ncomponents into your product itself to create the most powerful acquisition\ntool of all. First, it’s fundamentally free, making it obviously the most costeffective! Second, it can be remarkably fast, as seen in the skyrocketing\ngrowth of social-media and photo-sharing sites, among others. As a bonus,\nit’s highly likely that the first customers attracted to the new product will\nknow others who are also interested and will personally endorse and refer the\nproduct, app, or site to them.\nThree distinct types of social networks and network effects aid acquisition:\nWord of mouth, the most prevalent, encourages happy customers to share\nnews of their new-found product or service with friends and business\nassociates. It brings a personal friend-to-friend endorsement that’s\nextremely powerful\nSharing allows others to use and share articles, demos, and sample code so\npeople can re-Tweet and use it on social media, RSS feeds, etc.\nDirect network effects: People who want to share photos, make free calls,\nor have free video chats with friends need their friends to use the service,\nso they invite them to join\nA great test of how your product fits is asking your early customers, “On\na scale of 1 to 10 (with 10 being the best), would you recommend this\nproduct to your friends?” If your product doesn’t rank 9 or 10, it has little\nword of mouth or network effect.\nSome products are inherently viral...\nSome products are inherently viral, some aren’t. Some can be\nengineered to do so. For example, every sent Gmail message ends with the\ntag line, “Invite (recipient) to Gmail.” It uses the e-mail “send” process to\nexpand the network and Gmail’s user base.\nEncourage early customers or visitors to promote the product and your\ncompany to friends and business colleagues at every opportunity. Give them\nmaterials (e-mails, mailable links or demos), and consider rewarding them for\ndoing so, as many online marketers do. This tactic is highly cost-effective\nand credible when done right, in large measure because it brings with it the\nsender’s implied endorsement.\nDevelop simple widgets or links that make it easy for early visitors or\ncustomers to “like” the product, company or both on Facebook or to Tweet\nabout it. Create YouTube videos and other shareable content that encourages\nexploration of the product. People respond to their friends’ likes and dislikes\nand are more apt to explore something recommended by a friend than\nsomething they see in an e-mail or an ad. Create robust profiles of company,\nproduct and users wherever possible on Facebook and other relevant socialnetworking sites. Provide valuable information of interest to prospective\ncustomers rather than purely self-serving messages.\nYou might also want to consider creating separate, unbranded\nexperiences (sites, blogs) that are specifically geared toward the problem\nyour product or service is intended to solve. For example, a game startup\nmight create a site dedicated to “cheats” hints and tips. A medical-device\ncompany selling gastric bands might have a site dedicated to weight loss.\nThe Activation Plan and Tools\nWhile the previous step, acquisition, brings prospects to the doorstep (your\nhome page/landing page,) activation gets them to engaged with a sign-up, a\nfree or paid download, a click on something, game play, or a post on a site.\nHowever you engage the user, activation is the critical choke point in the\nsales funnel, where the customer begins a relationship with the product or\ncompany as a member, user, subscriber, player, or buyer. Whether you’re\nasking for sharing, playing, participation or an order, this is the place where a\nfirst-time visitor crosses the threshold to become an active user of your site or\napp.\nThe “Get Customers” Activation Activities in Web/Mobile Channels\n(Figure 8.6)\nIn the activation step, users decide—all by themselves—whether to\nengage with or buy your product, and the decision is often made in a matter\nof seconds. So the home or landing page must work hard and fast to activate\nnewly acquired “lookers,” converting them into buyers, users, or tryers.\n(Activation sometimes happens in an app store, via e-mail, through the\nchannel, or by telephone.) If you can’t get people to activate at once, ideally\nyou can get them to at least sign up so they can perhaps be persuaded to try,\nengage, or buy later.\n\nThe landing page is where activation most often begins. (Figure 8.7)\nWherever the customer arrives, he or she typically knows little if\nanything about where he or she has just landed. Here’s what you need to\naddress to activate a customer, using an oversimplified example of what goes\nthrough the visitor’s mind on arrival:\nWhy am I here? They want me to buy this new online multiplayer game\nWhat makes it special? Oh, here’s a feature list and reasons to buy\nHow do I know it’s any good? Here’s a demo, list of endorsements, user\nquotes, etc.\nWhere do I get more information? I see buttons pointing to free trials,\nmore info, etc.\nNext? What does the company want me to do? Oh, click here to try/\nbuy/sign up\nGuidelines for Developing the “Activate” Plan\nIn the customer validation phase, the activation plan is really a test plan, A/Btesting every key aspect of the home/landing page, from color and copy to\noffers and navigation. It’s OK to start with approximations or guesses, but\nthey should iterate rapidly based on measured customer responses.\nShould a landing-page offer scream “free” or subtly ask for a credit\ncard? Should the “buy now” button be elegant and on top or bright orange\nand huge in the lower right-hand corner? Does an animated product demo\nactivate more users than a simple graphic? There are scores if not hundreds of\nvariables on almost any home page, and many tests must be repeated more\nthan once to confirm results. Outside information architects and design\nprofessionals can help. They understand the range of tools available as well\nas the latest tricks of the trade in this highly creative process.\nThe list of tools, tricks, and variables to try is nearly endless, and it’s\nhard to predict which ones will win. That’s why repeated testing and\nmeasurement are so important, following the “test, measure, tweak” approach\ndiscussed earlier.\nHere’s what an activation plan should include:\nTwo types of action steps: Activation happens both on and off the home\npage, so create two separate lists of the “Get” customers activities you\nplan to test (like offering a premium with every signup)\nFirst/second test: This is customer discovery, where you’re running\nsmall-scale tests of your activation programs. Each of those programs\nneeds to be tested at least twice, if not far more frequently, as you try to\nfind the program that’ll generate the most users or customers. Identify at\nleast the first two tests\nPass/fail test: Every test should have a “pass/fail,” or an expectation that\ndefines what “success” will look like if you have it. Based on\nexperience, trials, or research, identify the metric that’ll determine if the\nexperiment was a success\nAn “Activate” Plan Example\nMost activation happens on the home or landing page, where you’re doing\nanything you can to get a user or customer you’ve acquired (he or she came\nto your page) and trying to engage them—get them to click, sign up, post a\ncomment, play, or buy.\nThe home page is “where the action is” for\nactivation.\nAnd while the home page is “where the action is” for activation, there\nare other things you can also do—like send follow-up e-mails, for example—\nto further engage someone who’s expressed more than a passing interest.\nTable 8.2 is a simplified example of what an activation plan might look\nlike for a social network where new golfers can offer and solicit improvement\ntips. In this example, since the business is in a multi-sided market, activation\ngoals include such non-monetary actions as registration, inviting friends,\nasking a question or answering one.\nSample Activation Plan for a Golfers’ Social Network (Table 8.2)\nTools for the Activate plan\nActivation happens both on and off the home page. Key tools to consider for\neach are in the bullet points that follow.\nOn the home or landing page\nThe landing page itself offers lots of ways to drive activations, including\ncontent, look and feel, and navigation. It can also showcase these activation\ntools:\nproduct demos\nfree trials\ncustomer contact tools\nanimation\nNon-home page acquisition tools\nWhile the home page is the primary activation tool, consider these others too:\ne-mail cascades\nprice/incentives\ntraditional tools\nOn the home or landing page itself:\nStart with Content, Look and Feel, Functionality\nand Navigation\nGood landing pages bear little resemblance to online brochures. They’re\ninvitations to “activate now,” working hard to invite customers to engage or\ninteract with—or buy—the product. This must happen literally at once, often\nin seconds. Otherwise the customer (and the money spent to acquire him or\nher in the previous step) vanishes with the click of a mouse. Develop the\nhome/landing page along four axes:\n1. Content: Does the site present everything for a customer needs to make\nthe “activation” decision simply, in multiple places (for example, does\nevery page say “join now”)? Is it friendly, informative, and inviting?\n2. Look and feel: Does the appearance relate to the audience (“corporate”\nfor business apps, “serious” for financial sites, “edgy” for teen or\nskateboarding products)? Does it match the typical style of the\ndemographic or their country?\n3. Functionality: What tools, widgets, configurators, demos or other\ndevices can quickly engage customers, get them experimenting with and\nexperiencing the product itself, and figuring out what it costs, how much\ntime it would save, or how the game plays?\n4. Navigation/structure: How is information organized? How accessible is\nit? How easy is it for users to complete high-value tasks (ordering,\nsearching, etc.)?\nHere’s how to approach each area.\nHome/Landing Page Content:\n• Tell me how I got here! Users arrive at the home/landing page in a\nvariety of ways (clicks, e-mails, referrals), but don’t assume they\nknow where they’ve landed. Welcome them; explain the site\n(“Welcome to the No. 1 online gaming portal.”) to avoid fast\nabandonment\n• Reinforce the “scent” of the e-mail, ad, or tool that drove the customer\nto the page. Use similar verbiage (and look and feel) to increase\nconfidence that the viewer has come to the right place\n• Issue a clear call to action. The “pitch,” or call to action, tells the\ncustomer what you want him or her to do. It should reflect positioning\ndeveloped in Stage 1 of validation, whether it’s “buy now,” “sign up,”\nor “attend a seminar.” Use redundant calls to action wherever you\ncan, but be sure they’re not confusing. Clearly tell visitors what to do\nand why doing so delivers value to them. The landing page should\nalways accomplish the following:\nExplain what problem the product solves and why it’s important to\nusers and worthy of their attention\nCommunicate ease of use and installation for the product\nClearly explain how the product works\nProvide fast proof that it works (user quotes, competitive analysis,\ndemos, etc.)\nCalls to action appear three ways on a home/landing page: hyperlinks,\nbuttons, and forms. They should stand out and be obvious to every visitor.\nHighlight product features that make the most powerful pitch for activation or\npurchase, and always provide easy access to more information about all the\nabove.\nSome guidelines for home or landing page content development:\nEncourage me to “experience the offer:” Never think of the landing\npage as a brochure. It’s effective only if it encourages customer\nengagement, trial, or purchase. All content should invite involvement,\nand offers should be judiciously sprinkled throughout headlines,\ngraphics and text, including “try now” textlinks embedded at least\noccasionally in body copy\nOffer multiple calls to action ranging from “buy now” and “learn more”\nto “download our white paper” and “talk to someone.” Remember to\nmake one of these far more prominent than all the others—the action\nmost desired by the company\nWrite short! Web visitors are very fragile, temporary guests. Respect\ntheir short attention spans and get to the point before they depart. The\nbest calls to action are generally written in 10 or fewer words and\ndisplayed in an easily readable font\nBe specific. One of the most powerful page elements should be the core\nproduct-positioning statement developed in Step 1 of customer\nvalidation. Succinctly tell users why they should buy or use what the\ncompany’s selling\nUse bold graphics such as snipes or bursts on the landing page to\npromote a mobile site.\nDeploy contests, promos and sweepstakes to encourage mobile\ndownloads. These are highly valuable in the online space—both for\nusers, who can redeem such offers immediately, and for startups, which\ncan test and adjust offers on the fly\nManage your content inventory. Content should build credibility for the\ncompany, presenting it as solid, established, and ready to do business.\nInformation on most of the following should be accessible from the landing\npage:\nproduct detail and information about the solution\ncustomer lists and success stories\ncustomer resources and support\nvendor partners\ncompany background\ncurrent news and events\ncompany contact information (postal, phone, and e-mail)\nthe company’s privacy policy\nLook and Feel\nDesign the home or landing page for maximum impact and minimal\nconfusion. Always provide the user with multiple pathways to the desired\n“activation” action, whether it’s subscribing, posting, playing or buying.\nStrive for fewer, crisper design elements, not more, keeping national cultural\ndifferences in mind when designing. (The advice below is for the U.S., where\nusers expect websites to look clean and simple.) In some other countries,\nincluding China, users expect more design elements, which may look\ncluttered to a Western eye.\nKeep it clean and simple, without too many distractions from the call to\naction\nPick one promotional message and drive it the hardest at the expense of\nothers. Make it more prominent, supported by other things on the page,\nand compelling, along the lines of “free trial download” or “special\nintroductory pricing this month”\nLeave plenty of white space. Crowded pages are clearly a turnoff. An\noverbearing number of graphic elements (art, type, buttons, etc.) will\nfrustrate and distract users\nUse visuals. Whether using graphics, videos, demos, or diagrams, don’t\nrely on copy itself to maintain user interest. Web visitors have extremely\nshort attention spans. Keep the diagrams, charts and graphics simple.\nUse animation carefully to add interest\nUse interactivity. The web allows customer interaction with the brand,\nsomething no other medium allows. (If these kinds of tools aren’t on the\nsite, you’re not using the web to its fullest potential)\nUse big buttons. “Download” or “buy now” or “sign up” should be\ngraphically interesting, sizable and easy to spot\nNavigation and Functionality\nNavigation is really about two things: the logical organization of information\nand the shortest routes to task completion.\n“Friendly” navigation provides users several “routes” to the call to\naction. Routes might take a user to a demo, to customer testimonials, to a\nwhite paper, or to a list of product features. Since nobody can predict what a\ncustomer wants to do next, each pathway should easily lead to “buy now” or\nanother call to action.\nConfusing navigation is the “foe,” offering too many choices, confusing\nbuttons, textlinks and a hodgepodge of options a user might choose. This\noften leads to higher abandon rates.\nOverall Website Functionality:\n• Use tools to invite customer engagement. Video, animation, demos,\nconfigurators and other devices should provide customers multiple\nways to engage with the product itself, any way they’d like. “Take a\ntour (of our product)” and “play now” and “forecast your retirement\nneeds” are typical engagement invitations, and each is far more\npowerful than offers like “read more” or “learn about...” Some\nexamples:\n1. “Enter your age/answer three questions to learn how little this\ninsurance costs”\n2. “Click here to see Facebook friends’ photos on our site”\n3. “Pick your character and start talking to him now”\n4. “Find young single women in your neighborhood right now”\n5. “What’s your favorite golf ball? Click here for deep discounts. Free\nshipping!”\n• Use a demo to engage users with the product and show off its features\nand ease of use. Make the demo more compelling (and under a minute\nlong) than a PowerPoint. When possible, draw users into an actual,\nfunctioning component of the product (“put your data here” or “play\nthis brief version.”). The demo should end at the call to action\nEngage users with the product and show off its\nfeatures.\n• Offer free trials. Not to be confused with a freemium pricing strategy, a\nfree trial offer can be restricted by limiting the free version’s\nfunctionality or duration (as in “try it free for two weeks”). Follow up\nwith a series of e-mails that introduce features, offer tips, and provide\nreasons to buy. Where it makes sense financially, follow up with\ntelesales\n• Click to contact. Particularly for commerce and paid subscription sites\n(and probably too costly for freemium or multi-sided startups), offer\nseveral ways for prospects to contact the company. This can be as\nsimple as a clickable link that spawns an e-mail to the sales\ndepartment or a form for requesting more information or a call from\nSales. Many commerce sites use real-time live voice and chat\ntechnology to engage quickly with prospects and enhance the chances\nof activation\n• Use animation. Interactive configurators, calculators, animated demos,\nmicrosites, and many other utilities can bring the product to life and\nengage the customer. These can be developed inexpensively by\noutside sources found online. Some websites launch brief welcome\nvideos or quiet, animated demos that load automatically when a user\ngets to the site, but only play on demand (so it doesn’t annoy the\nvisitor or drive her away). Use animation sparingly, as it can be\njarring\n• Incorporate source-driven pages: Create multiple landing pages and\nmatch each one to the source of the click that brought users to the\npage. “Welcome, Yahoo friends” would almost certainly increase the\nvisitor’s comfort and click-through rate, as would a “special offer for\nYahoo e-mail customers” that, oddly enough, is the same offer\npresented to Gmail customers or on a slightly different landing page\nAn entire industry has emerged around tools to\nencourage customers to take action.\nAn entire industry has emerged around tools to encourage customers to\ntake action while at a company’s website. New home-page tools are\ndeveloped regularly, and some grow in popularity while others fade. This is\nan area where a modest amount of time spent on online research about the\nlatest tools can pay off. In addition, freelance or small-agency experts in\nactivation tests might be helpful (just remember that you don’t want to run\nmajor programs yet, just experiments). Check www.steveblank.com for the\nlatest tools.\nBeyond the Home Page itself, Consider these\nAdditional Activation Tools:\nE-mail cascades: E-mail addresses are difficult to acquire, since customers\nresist registering, knowing that sales e-mails will follow. Think of customers’\ne-mail addresses as valuable assets: prospects willing to be sold. Develop\nsequences of three e-mails that strike a balance between brevity and\nenthusiasm for the product and its features, and stress key elements of the\nvalue proposition. Each e-mail should highlight different features or other\nreasons to buy and, where possible, tailor the message to reflect the source of\nthe sign-up (referring site, location on website). Every e-mail should have\nmultiple calls to action, both in textlinks and via a visible graphic “action”\nbutton, along with offers of further information and, of course, an easy way\nto unsubscribe. Compare the tradeoffs of HTML and text e-mails, since many\nmail servers block HTML e-mail.\nPrice/incentives: As discussed in detail in the section on revenue model\nhypotheses in Chapter 3, pricing can be another activation tool: free,\nfreemium, special offers, and volume discounts can all be used. To avoid\ncannibalization of the company’s revenues, consider making the special\ndiscount offer as a follow-up, after the prospect has declined the full-price\noffer at least once.\nTraditional tools: Don’t overlook a wide range of traditional, non-digital\nmarketing tools when it comes to activating customers. Contests are often\nused (“win 500 frequent flyer miles” or “get a free tote bag,” for example), as\nare sweepstakes (“you could win a free trip”). Outbound telemarketing can be\na powerful tool to active folks who register. Direct mail can sometimes be\nused cost-effectively, as can traditional media advertising, where you can\nconsider using QR codes.\nWhatever the tool, test it during customer validation and measure the\nresult as well as the resulting cost per activation. Compare the costs of\nacquiring active users with traditional vs. online tools and consistently\noptimize for the lowest cost per active user. If your test seems to work in a\ncontrolled test, expand the test and try again to see if the program scales.\nMuch more on this in Phase 2.\nManaging the Activate Plan\nClose management of activation tests step is vital. In the next step,\noptimization, we’ll discuss the use of dashboards to measure performance\nand cost-efficiency of each activation program individually. However, as a\nfirst step, a simple “funnel” can be used to monitor activation. Here’s an\nexample:\nExample of a Simple Activation Funnel (Figure 8.8)\nThis funnel monitors prospects as they move through each step of the\nactivation process. In this example, only one website visitor in 10 (10\npercent) signs up for the free trial. Worse, only 9 percent of that group\nactually activates, becoming users of the product. And only a very small\nsubset of that group moves on to become active users of the product or\nservice. In this simple example, the company will need to attract literally\nmillions of “free trial” sign-ups in order to build a sizable number of active\nusers—a daunting challenge indeed.\nChecklist 28: Get Ready To Sell —\nAcquire/Activate Customers\nGoal: Devise plans for getting customers to the app or site to sign up or buy\nReference: Chapter 8, Customer Validation Phase 1: Get Ready to Sell\nAcquire plan and tools\nWho is responsible for driving the program\nTactic\nBudget\nTiming\nAcquisition goals\nMultisided or not\nSocial, network and viral components\n4 weeks’ worth of initial activities to test\nActivation plan and tools\nOn landing page\nHow customer arrived at site\nReinforce language/tone of invitation\nIssue multiple clear calls to action\nExplain what problem the product solves\nOff landing page tactics to test\nA/B tests\nExit criteria:\nInitial “acquire” and “activate” plans for the first four weeks\nPass/Fail tests identified\nGet Ready to Sell: Build a High Fidelity MVP\nCustomer discovery used your two MVPs to rapidly test and iterate\nprototypes to learn about the problem/need and solution. The goal of the\nMVP in customer discovery wasn’t sales, just customer feedback.\nThis step tests the high fidelity minimum viable product. It’s a more\nfeatured complete and polished functional version of the one used in Phase 3\nof customer discovery. It still does not offer all the features and functionality\nthe ultimate product vision will deliver. Why hi-fidelity? As customer\nvalidation invites more users to the product to test acquisition and activation\ntactics, the hi-fidelity MVP improves the test results, since visitors don’t feel\nas if they’re looking at a second-class product even if the MVP is an\nincomplete rendering of the product, as is often the case.\nWhat does “part” of a product look like? It might be a multiplayer game\nwith five levels of play instead of the 20 or 50 that will eventually be\nincluded. A social network could have limited features that don’t allow photo\nsharing or provide users’ locations but facilitates easy interaction and\nnavigation. An online shoe store might have only women’s casual shoes as a\nstart, or it might not offer odd sizes while providing a superb e-commerce\nexperience. If features aren’t live for the customer validation tests, consider a\npage or several highlighting features that are “coming soon,” but don’t make\nit too prominent, since the objective is to test-sell the MVP now, not to give\ncustomers a reason to wait.\nNote that a hi-fidelity MVP doesn’t just magically appear in this step.\nYou don’t just stop at this step and write one. Instead, it’s the result of agile\ndevelopment with continuous deployment and continuous product and feature\nrefinements that have been made since the company opened for business (one\nof the many reasons you can’t do Customer Development with waterfall\nengineering). You haven’t gotten this far unless your product development\nteam has continually iterated, deployed, tested and improved the high fidelity\nMVP since you left Phase 3 of customer discovery.\nNow if not earlier, the hi-fidelity MVP must be architected for\ninstrumentation that delivers a stream of customer and product behavior data\nused at the company every single day to further develop the business model\nand the product. Ensure that the dials, meters and gauges are working, and\nthen hold onto your seat because we’re about to move those needles. Think of\ninstrumentation for a software application as gauges and instruments on the\nbusiness model canvas, providing information about what’s happening in the\napplication.\nChecklist 29: Create a High Fidelity MVP\nGoal: Develop a polished, functional MVP\nReference: Chapter 8, Customer Validation Phase 1: Get Ready to Sell\nRefined, more “complete” or polished version of the low-fidelity MVP\nused in Customer Discover to elicit customer feedback\nPart of the product – incomplete but polished rendering of product\nvision\nLimited features, but not second-class\nInvites more users to the product to test the acquisition and activation\ntactics\nArchitected to deliver customer and product behavior data\nExit criteria:\nA High Fidelity MVP, which will be used to generate a steady stream\nof customer and product behavior data to refine the business model\nand product\nGet Ready to Sell: Build a Metrics Toolset\nWeb/mobile businesses focus on data collection, analysis and\noptimization from the day they go live till the day the doors close. A\nweb/mobile startup’s conversion funnel monitors customers through their\nentire life cycle. The entire process is driven by a never-ending campaign to\ntest, measure, and optimize every step in the funnel, from awareness to\npurchase. It’s a 24/7 process of “try it, measure it, tweak it.”\nWeb/mobile businesses focus on data collection,\nanalysis and optimization from the day they go live\ntil the day the doors close.\nThe products you build should be instrumented to measure every click\non the website or app, its source, and the action it causes or doesn’t. As a\nresult, the management team should have at its fingertips a dashboard that\nsummarizes every key, actionable user behavior, and delivers insights and\ntrends that drive continual business improvement. There are two parts to\nbuilding a metrics tool set:\ndetermining which key business metrics need to be measured\ndeveloping a dashboard or system to collect and monitor the data\nKey Metrics to Measure\nLong before the web was born, 19th-century retailer John Wanamaker of\nPhiladelphia summarized the challenge that online and mobile marketers\nwould face nearly two centuries later: “I know I’m wasting half of my\nadvertising budget. I only wish I knew which half.” In the web/mobile\nchannels, this process is far easier than it was for Wanamaker’s newspaper\nand radio ads, because every click and consumer action can be recorded.\nDetermining what to measure is where the process begins.\nUsing your customer relationships hypotheses, identify the metrics for\nsuccess in the business model. Prioritize and limit the number of metrics to\nfewer than a dozen, and the only metrics to be measured are those that can be\nacted on or improved. Think: “how many, how fast, how much, and how\ngood?”\nHow many customers are acquired, and how many of those are\nactivated? (And how many are lost? And where in the purchase process\ndo you lose them?)\nHow fast do they arrive and how fast do they activate? After one page\nview or visit, or 20 of either?\nHow much does each acquisition and activation cost?\nHow good are the customers who are being acquired? Active users/\nspenders who return again and again or visitors with no “stickiness” at\nall?\nMetrics to Measure, in the “Get Customers” Funnel Web/Mobile\nChannels (Figure 8.9)\nFor consistency’s sake, consider organizing the metrics the way the sales\nfunnel is organized—by acquisition and activation metrics. For example:\nAcquisition metrics:\nTotal number of visits by visitor type, time of day, and source, and page\nviews per visit\nPaid and referred traffic conversion rates by source (how many links or\nbanners, and at what cost, to generate one visitor or user) and cost per\nacquired/activated user\nQuantities and percentages of referred traffic by source\nUnique behaviors or actions of subsets or segments of the customer\nuniverse\nI know I’m wasting half of my ad budget. I only\nwish I knew which half...\nActivation metrics\nTotal number of activations: another percentage of hourly/daily/weekly\nacquisitions\nNumber/percentage of activations, tracked back to the original source\nNumber/percentage/cost per activation, based on quality (heavy users\nand big spenders or modest spenders and inactive users?), wherever\nidentifiable, preferably by source\nNumber of visits, page views, referrals per activated user, by source and\nby cost\nActivation metrics also capture user behavior for assessment and\nimprovement. Typical behavior metrics include the number and percentage of\npeople who download or otherwise activate, register or engage within a\ncertain number of visits or page views.\nMonitor people who take an activation action, like watching a demo, and\nthen don’t activate, as well as those who abandon during the enrollment or\nregistration process. Again, the list is endless, so be careful not to measure\nmore than the team can manage or improve on effectively.\nThis list is the tip of a huge iceberg. Focus on the ones that help you\nunderstand customer behavior to efficiently drive acquisition and activation\nand ultimately drive revenue!\n“Grow Customer” Referrals happen through “Viral loops.”\n(Figure 8.10)\nReferral Metrics\nReferral metrics are important because recommendations from existing\ncustomers are the most cost-effective source of new customers. Key referral\nmetrics are:\nnumber and percentage of users referred\naverage number of prospects existing customers\nreferral acceptance rate\nAssess referral incentive programs to determine which incentives\nmotivate the most new users to refer others and the cost per referral.\nAt this point in the customer validation process, it’s too early to worry\nmuch about customer retention (discussed in depth in Phase 2), since the\ncompany’s overwhelming early focus is on getting its first customers. When\ndesigning the metrics system, make sure it can accommodate metrics that will\nbe needed later to monitor retention and referral, including user cohorts\ndescribed in detail in Phase 2.\nUse a dashboard or system to collect and monitor\ndata\nYour startup’s future lies in its customer acquisition, activation and retention\ndata. This is so important that many web businesses actually display their\nreal-time site-performance data on a jumbo flat-screen monitor in the office\nso that it’s always the center of attention. Off-the-shelf dashboard systems are\navailable, and home-grown solutions are readily built using tools as simple as\nExcel.\nBe careful not to overdo it with metrics. A small\nnumber of metrics tell the overall “health” story of\nthe business.\nBe careful not to overdo it with metrics. Generally, a relatively small\nnumber of metrics tell the overall “health” story of the business, so resist the\ntemptation to generate complex, overwhelming collections of data that take\nmanagement eyes off the key issues. Those issues usually revolve around\n“how many, how much, how fast”: how many customers are activated (or\nlost), at what cost, and how quickly. Good CEOs have these key statistics as\nwell as their improvement trends and key drivers at their fingertips and can\nrecite them almost on cue. Equally important, they can be measured on a\nwhiteboard or a simple spreadsheet.\nThe metrics you use to measure and monitor your business ought to be\nthe same ones you and your board are looking at during board meetings. If\nthey’re only asking you for income statement, balance sheet and cash flow\nand not looking at these numbers, you’ve failed as a CEO. It’s your job to get\nyour board to agree that the numbers you’re worrying about are the numbers\nthey’re worrying about.\nFigure 8.11 shows a dashboard for a simple content site where the\nbusiness goals are increased page views, customer referrals, and e-mail\ndelivery.\nExample of a Simple Dashboard (Figure 8.11)\nIn the next step, if your startup doesn’t already have one, you’ll recruit\nand install a “data chief” to manage the data and its interpretation. He’ll also\nquarterback the company’s plan to use that data to drive continuous\nimprovement in the way customers discover, engage with, and use the\nproduct and how they help sell it to their friends and colleagues.\nChecklist 30: Build Metrics Toolset\nGoal: Determine which key business metrics to measure and develop a\nsystem or dashboard for collecting and monitoring data\nReference: Chapter 8, Customer Validation Phase 1: Get Ready to Sell\n12 key metrics identified: Basic visit metrics (page views, unique\nvisitors, pages/visit)\nAcquisition activities and behaviors\nActivation activities and behaviors\nReferral activities and behaviors\nDashboard created or purchased to collect and monitor data\nFocused on key metrics, not all metrics\nEasy, at-a-glance format\nAble to accommodate metrics needed later to monitor retention and\nreferral, including user cohorts\nExit criteria:\nList of key metrics to measure for customer acquisition, activation and\nreferral efforts\nSystem for monitoring metrics near real-time\nGet Ready to Sell: Hire a Data Analytics Chief\nIn a startup that’s selling physical goods, it was the founders who first had\nto find the sales roadmap and then hired a sales closer to assist them.\nLikewise, a web/mobile company needs a dedicated data analytics chief after\nthe founders have discovered the key customer acquisition and activation\nmetrics. The analytics chief will drive “continuous improvement,” not just in\nthe customer validation process but in perpetuity.\nThe analytics chief will drive “continuous\nimprovement,\n” not just in the customer validation\nprocess but in perpetuity.\nAt first, one of the founders may take on this role. (Extra credit if he’s\nan experienced “data junkie,” statistical analyst, or “quant” who loves to\ncollect and pore over data, looking for anomalies, opportunities, trends and\nweaknesses.) Whether the person’s called the chief marketing officer, the\ndata analytics chief, the database or online marketing director, or just plain\n“founder” is irrelevant. Agility with numbers and tools are critical job skills,\nas is innate curiosity. Also required: the “clout” to make things happen in the\ncompany once the data shows that something isn’t happening per plan and\nrequires a pivot. Responsibilities include:\nonline optimization of targeted campaigns, managing all aspects of\ncustomer behavior reporting, tracking, analysis, and optimization\nmanagement of all internal research, sponsorship, lead generation, and\npromotion programs\ndevelopment and management of plans, budgets costs and results of\nmarketing programs\nmanagement of budgets, forecasts, tracking and administration of\nprogram costs and results\nassuring the data is available to all key team members\nIf this person is not a founder, he or she must be a part of the senior\nmanagement team, reporting to and updating it regularly. He or she should be\nhired as early as possible, ideally in time to participate in development of the\ndashboard system and selection of the metrics it will track. He or she must\nfully understand the business model and key business drivers, as he or she\nwill be a loud voice driving pivots and iterations. The person must be a good\ncollaborator, easy to work with, and highly creative—a rare combination.\nThis person must be a part of the senior\nmanagement team.\nAgree on how often the CEO should be briefed. The management team?\nThe entire staff? Remember to focus the person on prioritizing and collecting\nonly key, actionable data, not reams of useless information. Craft both\ncompensation and confidentiality/no-compete agreements with this person,\nwho will know more about the company’s business drivers than virtually\nanyone else. Losing this person prematurely can be a major setback.\nChecklist 31: Hire a Data Analytics Sales Chief\nGoal: Have a dedicated analytics expert on the senior management team\nReference: Chapter 8, Customer Validation Phase 1: Get Ready to Sell\nAnalytics chief identified\nAgility with numbers and analytics tools\nInnate curiosity\nHighly creative\nGood collaborator\nEasy to work with\nClout to make things happen when a pivot is required\nReporting schedule devised\nExit criteria:\nData Analytics expert hired to drive continuous improvement for the\ncompany\nGet Ready to Sell: Formalize the Advisory Board\nHopefully, you’ve asked for help from advisers on an informal basis in\ncustomer discovery. In this phase, it’s time to formally engage them. There\nare no hard and fast rules for how large an advisory board should be or\nwhether it should be a “board” at all. Basically, you want two things from\nadvisors: great introductions you can’t get any other way to key customers,\ntalent or investors; and bold, out-of-the-box business model design thinking\nthat will have dramatic impact on your strategy. All the rest is window\ndressing.\nThink strategically, not tactically, about advisors’ reach and sphere of\ninfluence. Recruit only advisors who will make a serious impact on the\ncompany in one way or another—think quality, not quantity. (If you’re\nraising money having a cloud of “impressive names” may help, but don’t\nconfuse them with these people.) Formal advisory board meetings aren’t\nrequired, at least for now, but this process should deliver access to experts\nwho can help.\nBegin by assembling an advisory board road map, much like the\ncollateral roadmap developed earlier. As shown in Table 8.3, the roadmap is\nan organized list of the key advisors needed. (Don’t feel compelled to put\nadvisors in every box on the chart.)\nIn this example, the roadmap differentiates how each advisor will be\nused (technical, business, customer, industry or marketing). Usually, the most\nimportant advisors your startup can have are the ones with “golden\nrolodexes” who can make high-level introductions to early customers,\nchannel partners, or partners who can deliver significant web traffic. Product\nDevelopment may need technical advisors as early as Phase 1 of customer\ndiscovery. The technical advisory board is staffed with advisors from\nacademia or industry who can offer technical advice and pointers to technical\ntalent. As the company begins to sell product, these advisors are used as\ntechnical references for customers.\nWhere possible, particularly in enterprise sales situations, put key\npotential customers on the customer advisory board. These are people met in\ncustomer discovery who can advise about the product from the customer’s\nperspective. I always tell these advisors, “I want you on my advisory board so\nI can learn how to build a product you’ll buy. We both fail if I can’t.” They’ll\nserve as a customer conscience for the product, and later some will be great\nreferences for, or introducers to, other customers. Use them for insight and\none-on-one meetings with the company’s business and Customer\nDevelopment staff—and don’t be afraid to ask them for specific\nintroductions.\nAdvisory Board Roles (Table 8.3)\nTwo other sets of advisors to consider: an industry advisory board of\ndomain experts who bring credibility to the company’s specific market or\ntechnology; and an advisor to the CEO who’s a “been there, done that” CEO\ntype who can bring practical, how-to advice.\nMake sure that, for people that count to you, you\ncount to them.\nThe number of advisors for each domain will obviously vary with\ncircumstances, but there are some rules of thumb. Both sales and marketing\nadvisors tend to have large egos. You can usually only manage only one of\nthem at a time. Industry advisors like to think of themselves as the pundits for\nparticular industries. Have them give you their opinions without being in the\nsame room or showing up on the same day—this allows you to sort through\nwhose advice you want to follow. Business advisors are much like marketing\nadvisors, but some have expertise in different stages of the company.\nConsider keeping a few on hand to make you smarter. Finally, our product\ndevelopment team could never get enough of the technical advisors. They’d\ncome in and make us smarter about specific technical issues. The same was\ntrue for the customer advisors. Be sure to learn something new every time\nthey come by.\nCompensating Advisors\nThe Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffet, says it best: “Make sure that, for\npeople that count to you, you count to them.” That about sums it up. Advisers\ntypically receive common stock without precise correlation to the hours\nthey’ll give your company or exactly what they’ll do to help. The stock\ntypically vests over time, in monthly increments, so it’s easily adjusted based\non the adviser’s value to the company.\nThe best advisors of all pay you to become advisors.\nThey often make a modest cash investment.\nThe best advisors of all pay you to become advisors. They often make a\nmodest cash investment of, say, $20,000 or $100,000 for some of the\ncompany’s preferred stock, and their investment is “boosted” with a generous\nallocation of common shares that pay for the advisory services. Sophisticated\ninvestors recognize the importance of advisors’ willingness to not only lend\ntheir names but also invest some personal cash in what they clearly believe is\na significant opportunity.\nChecklist 32: Formalize Advisory Board\nGoal: Formally engage advisors who can facilitate high-level introductions\nand are top-notch “out of the box” thinkers\nReference: Chapter 8, Customer Validation Phase 1: Get Ready to Sell\nAdvisory board roadmap assembled\nSize – quality vs. quantity\nAbility to make high-level introductions\nTechnical expertise\nMeetings or no meetings?\nKey potential customers\nDomain experts\nA seasoned CEO type\nDecide about compensation\nExit criteria:\nFormal depiction of the size, makeup and operation of the company’s\nadvisory board(s)\n\nCHAPTER 9\nCustomer Validation, Phase Two: Get Out\nof the Building and Sell!\nIN THIS PHASE OF CUSTOMER VALIDATION, it’s time to try to sell. Customer\ndiscovery had you get out of the building twice, first to understand\ncustomers’ problems and how they work and second to determine how well\nthe new product solves that problem. And while you’ve no doubt conducted\nhundreds of tests to iterate and pivot your business model, there is no better\n“pass/fail” test than asking a customer to give you an order or spend time\nwith your app or website.\nIn a physical channel, nothing validates a hypothesis better than a signed\norder, especially when it’s signed before the product is either complete or\nactually shipping. In the web/mobile channel, the equivalent validation is\nattracting users or payers at the rate your hypotheses said you would. (In a\nmulti-sided market, even if you’re getting great traffic and growth, be sure\nthe “other” side, usually the advertisers or payers, are eager to spend to reach\nyour traffic.)\nYour job in this phase is not to scale a revenue plan but to validate your\nbusiness model hypotheses with pass/fail tests that feel an awful lot like\nselling or building web traffic. But revenue or traffic at full scale doesn’t\nhappen until the next step, customer creation. Customer validation is the test\nsales process that—while it makes real sales—is principally aimed at\nanswering a long list of questions, including:\nAre customers enthusiastic about the product’s value proposition?\nDoes the company understand its customer segments and their needs?\nDo customers truly value the product features? Are any key features\nmissing?\nIs the product pricing right, and can the product be sold at a reasonable\ncost?\nWhat’s the purchasing and approval process inside a customer’s\ncompany?\nAre the sales roadmap and channel strategy valid for scaling the sales\nteam?\nAre there enough customers to make this a real business?\n“Get out of the building” means one thing for companies with physical\ngoods or those primarily using the physical channel, and it means something\nradically different for companies in the web/mobile channels. Figure 9.1\nshows the differences.\nIn customer validation, the testing process is a series of elegantly simple\npass/fail tests where the answer is binary, and never “it feels good” or “they\nlike it.” Some examples:\nIf your physical channel business model says...\nyou will close two sales for every 10 sales calls, do you?\nan average customer will buy six widgets in three months, do they?\n$5,000 at spent at a tradeshow (or in direct mail) will generate 25 leads,\ndoes it?\n2/3 of the prospects you pitch will refer you to three friends each, do\nthey?\nIf your web/mobile channel business model says...\ntwo of five acquired users will activate, do they?\nfour in 10 activators will pass your free trial offer to five friends, do\nthey?\n$100 spent on AdWords will generate 50 clicks to your site, does it\nhappen?\none in four advertisers in your multi-sided market will sit still for your\nadvertising sales pitch (even though they probably won’t buy till you\nhave lots more traffic), do they?\nHere are the next steps you’ll undertake, by channel:\nSteps for “Get Out of the Building and Sell” by Channel (Figure 9.1)\nGet Out of the Building: Prepare Optimization\nPlans/Tools\nThe job of optimization is to squeeze more out of each of the “get, keep\nand grow” steps. Squeeze more of what, you ask? More of everything. For\nexample:\nIf 6 percent of visitors activate at launch, try to increase it to 10 percent\nor more\nWhen visitors abandon after two page views, can navigation increase it\nto three?\nIf 5 percent of visitors post a comment, how can you encourage more to\ndo so?\nIf the average cost per activated user is $1, how can you lower it to\n$0.75 or $0.80?\nCan you improve e-mail open rates from 22 percent to 30 percent?\nGetting more is what optimization is all about, and you’ll do it from this\nmoment until the moment you’re selling off your furniture or ringing the bell\nat NASDAQ. This and the next two web/mobile sections provide a primer on\noptimization, the subject of many full-length texts. In this section, you will:\nGet a basic primer on optimization strategy\nTake a look at how optimization goes to work at a hypothetical web\nstartup\nand learn about the key optimization tools and how they work\nThe next optimize “Get” web/mobile section will take what you learn\nfrom this section and show you how to put your “new” tools to work. And the\nthird section will do the same for “keep” and “grow” customers activities.\nThe “Get Customers” Funnel in Web/Mobile Channels (Figure 9.2)\nBefore you start\nBefore you start optimizing your site/app, just as a reminder that the\nfollowing building blocks must be in place:\n1. A hi-fidelity MVP. It must be live and the product should look “finished”\n(even if the MVP isn’t fully featured). This ensures clear product\nfeedback and the most accurate measurement of “get customers”\nprogram results.\n2. The Acquire plan and tools. E-mails, AdWords, banners, pr efforts, viral\nprograms and other tools that will drive consumers to engage with the\nproduct.\n3. The Activate plan and tools. Home and landing pages encourage people\nto buy, engage, or activate, supported with activation tools such as\nfollow-up e-mails, calls, or viral and promotion programs for those who\ndon’t buy or engage at once.\n4. A dashboard to monitor customers’ behavior. It should be working and\nthe product should be instrumented to deliver real-time data on results of\nacquisition and activation programs.\nCustomer Optimization Strategy\nOptimization efforts should focus on:\nVolume: Acquire as many visitors as possible and drive to them to the\nproduct\nCost: Steadily improve the cost per activated customer\nConversion: Increase the number of visitors who activate and become\ncustomers or users\nThe first question to address is “What do I optimize?” Different types of\nweb business optimize for entirely different things.\nThe first question to address is,\n“What do I\noptimize?”\nHere’s how three types of web/mobile business should be thinking about their\n“Get” customers optimization:\nE-commerce sites should start by optimizing traffic and initial orders, of\ncourse, and then move on to focus on average order size, repeat orders,\nand customer referrals\nMulti-sided markets (usually ad-supported) should focus first on total\ntraffic, then on members or subscribers, DAU (daily active users),\nminutes of engagement, repeat visits, and referrals. They should then\nmove to the “other side” to maximize ad revenue, CPM, and sales\npipeline\nMarketplaces should focus on everything an e-commerce site would\noptimize as well as the number of vendors, seller acquisition and\nretention and liquidity (how many of the items for sale actually get\nsold). Then they should try to optimize daily transactions and average\ntransaction size\nMore Keys to Successful Optimization Strategy:\nKnow exactly why you’re testing, as in “to see if we can improve\nregistrations” or “to see if free shipping materially increases orders.”\nDon’t test everything, test the important things.\nDon’t overtest. This is a major mistake made by many web startups\nbecause testing is just so easy online. Don’t test everything, test the\nimportant things. Don’t test more than two changes to a page at a time,\nto avoid confusing your visitors so you can tell which change drove\nwhich improvement. When a test “succeeds,” be sure you know what\nmade the difference\nRun controlled tests to guarantee randomness and validity. A strict A/B\ntest, the most common controlled test, shows every other visitor version\n“A” or version “B” of a page or an offer. It rigorously controls the\nvariables. It doesn’t show “A” on Monday and “B” on Tuesday, since\nthere’s no way to determine what else might have influenced customer\nbehavior in the test, which could be almost anything: a sale at a\ncompetitive site, a change in the weather, or even the time of day\n(people mostly surf at work during lunchtime)\nAlways keep lifetime value in mind. The cost of getting a customer is\nnowhere near as important as the revenue that customer brings you over\ntime, and the lifetime value math for “get customers” is pretty simple:\nLTV=>CAQ\nLTV or Lifetime value (the total amount of money you’ll make from this\ncustomer) must be more than the CAQ or customer acquisition cost (costs to\nacquire and activate the customer).\nToo many companies go out of business telling themselves, “This\ncustomer will be worth ‘X’ over five years,” forgetting the second part: “only\nif we’re still here and they’re still with us.” Use a reasonable, not-too-long\nlifetime value. For example, how many months of subscription revenue will it\ntake to repay my “get customers” cost?\nIn summary: The optimization plan will change often, perhaps as often\nas every day. Start by defining the specific acquisition metrics to optimize.\nDon’t tackle too many at once, and always know what your goal is when you\nbegin the experiment. As you’re running your tests, create alternatives for the\ntactics that don’t perform well after optimization.\nOptimization is a never-ending data-driven process\nof “test, measure, tweak.”\nOptimization is a never-ending data-driven process of “test, measure,\ntweak” that stops only when the company closes its doors. Founders should\nbe intimately involved with, if not leading, the process, since it’s vital to your\ncompany’s efficiency, scalability, and future.\nA Lesson in Optimization Tactics\nLet’s look at how optimization works in real time in a hypothetical company\nselling the first in a series of downloadable $39.95 software apps for homebased businesspeople. The CEO has focused her team on two key metrics at\nthe widest part of the funnel: the total cost of activating a customer (including\nthe cost of acquiring him or her), and the ultimate value of each activated\ncustomer individually. Let’s follow along, starting with a look at the data\nchief’s first analysis of acquisition and activation programs. Here’s how it\nlooks in chart form:\nExample of Optimization Tactics Chart (Table 9.1)\nWalking through the example one line at a time provides a wealth of insights\ninto the optimization process itself.\n• Acquisition delivered 200 “lookers” at an average cost of $5 per\ncustomer click, or $1,000 (clicks can cost as little as pennies or as\nmuch as $50 or more, depending on demand for the AdWords). If we\ncould reduce the cost per looker by 20 percent we would deliver 25\npercent more prospects to the company without increasing the budget\nAcquisition Improvements to test: Stop using the most expensive\nAdWords. Try alternative sources of traffic beyond Google.\nExplore alternative programs like banners and textlinks. Reduce\ndaily AdWords budgets or hours or geography (eliminate\novernight hours, Europe, or weekends for example). Increase viral\nmarketing at low cost\n• Activation 40 people (20 percent of the 200 who clicked to the site)\nactivated – meaning they took a demo or provided their contact\ninformation. Therefore the cost of each activation was $25 (or $1,000\nspent divided by 40 people). Yet at this point no one has bought\nanything\nActivation Improvements to test: Intensify or enlarge calls to action\nor graphics. Improve or increase activation incentives. Change\nprice or introductory offer. Reorganize the way features/benefits\nare prioritized and explained. Consider a free trial\n• Purchase – half the activated customers buy an application for $39.95.\nIn this example that’s 20 people, each spending $40, for a total of\n$800 in sales. These customers, while apparently profitable (on a\ngross profit basis), are “losers” because it cost $25 to get someone to\nspend $40—63 percent of the sale—which can’t be viable for most\nbusinesses, as it leaves very little to cover product, staff, overhead\nand, profit. But, if the funnel delivered just five more customers, the\nsame $1,000 investment would deliver $200 more in sales.\n• Purchase Improvements to test\nDeploy activation improvements, but also research non-buyers to\nunderstand why they’re non-buyers\nAdd a demo\nAdd “click to call” contact option\nConduct A/B tests of price and offer\nConsider follow-up e-mail or phone calls to close\nNow take a last look at Table 9.1. Imagine that in addition to the 20\nbuyers of our $39.95 software package, the company acquires 10 additional\nValued Customers. Instead of just buying one software product, these\ncustomers buy on average 2.5 software packages, spending $100 each to do\nso. That generates $1,000 in revenue from valued customers. Over time, these\nValued Customers are probably worth even more, since they may also\ngenerate referrals to others and buy more packages themselves later.\nIn all, this test would be labeled at best a modest victory for some\n(where the cost of goods is very low, as it is for software downloads).\nGenerating $1,800 in revenue as well as future prospects—activators who\nnever bought—with $1,000 on marketing spending reflects a software\ncompany with a promising future, assuming it can further optimize its funnel\nfor the long term.) Clearly, improvements at every step of the funnel process\ncan deliver big incremental revenue and profit improvements.\nApply this kind of thinking and detailed analysis to every key program\noutlined in your “get” plan. Test a program, measure the results, and\nbrainstorm ways to improve the results. Change some aspect of the program\n(the offer, the graphics, the messaging, as outlined in your plan) and test it\nand measure it again. Once it’s measured, assess the results, develop the next\nimprovement idea, and test it again... and again... and again. As we said at the\noutset, this is the lifeblood of web/mobile startups, and the process truly\nnever ends.\nOptimization Tools:\nLike any good craftsperson, good tools are essential to doing a good job.\nHere is an overview of the key tools used most often by web and mobile\nmarketers. In the next two web/mobile sections, we’ll talk to you about where\nand how to use each one. In most cases, they’re used in each of the three get,\nkeep and grow optimizations, since most (but not all) customer interaction\nhappens online.\nSample A/B Tests Compare Changing Home Page Results (Figure 9.3)\nA/B Testing\nA/B testing is the most widely used way to optimize web and mobile “get,\nkeep and grow” activities. It can also be used to optimize web/mobile product\nperformance (the subject of a different book). A/B testing compares one web\npage version with another to see which produces the best results. It’s the most\nused method for testing key landing-page elements. Did a big blue button get\nmore activations than a small line of text? Which headline, picture, or product\noffer generated more sign-ups, sales or abandons?\nActivation mantra: The more we test, the better we\ndo.\nIdentify the key elements of your landing page that drive activation, and\ntest them carefully, fairly, and sequentially. Think of the process as “try it,\nmeasure it, tweak it.” The activation mantra: The more we test, the better we\ndo. Remember to maintain a clear control group: change the presentation to\nhalf the audience, ideally alternating from one visitor to the next (in A/B,\nevery second visitor sees “b”). Many testers drive 80% of the traffic to one\nalternative, and 20% to the other, which can test on high-traffic pages well.\nUsability Tests\nUsability testing checks whether the users of the site/app/product use it the\nway you intended them to. It can be as informal as inviting consumers into\nthe conference room and watching them spend time on the website or as\ncomprehensive as a formal focus-group testing. It can identify weaknesses in\nthe site’s explanation of the product, its benefits, and the reasons to buy. It\ncan trace users’ behavior on the site to determine ways to optimize the\nconversion rates, enhance online product demonstrations, or find confusing\ncopy, diagrams, or navigation. Inexpensive tools and expensive services can\nboth help with the testing.\nUsability Tests happen in Starbucks or test facilities (Figure 9.4)\nInvite your target customers to the office and watch as they engage with\nthe site or app (and use any of the online services like Userfy or Usertesting\nthat do low-cost user testing). Watch these customers explore uninterrupted\nwhile watching over their shoulder. Make notes about where they went and\nwhere they didn’t, and follow up to learn why they did what they did.\nObviously, as you learn about confusing or suboptimal locations or\nnavigation on the site, test and measure alternatives until the problem goes\naway. Consider conducting user testing with a laptop at Starbucks, where\nrandom customers get coffee or a gift card for spending 10 minutes with you,\nexploring and discussing the new product, app or site.\nHeat Maps\nHeat maps use eye tracking to show where most people look or click on a\nwebsite or page. Software tracks a user’s gaze and translates them into\nregions colored yellow, orange and red. The richer the color, the more\neyeballs are focused on the button, headline or graphic.\n\nExample of Heat Mapping (Figure 9.5)\nIf too many customers are drawn to the “demo” button instead of the\n“try now” button, perhaps the sizes or locations or both should be changed.\nThe heat map indicates high-traffic spots on a page, where the most important\nproduct features or offers should be located. Heat maps may even show that\nvisitors are clicking on graphics or copy that aren’t linked to anything.\nEye Tracking\nEye tracking uses heat-map technology in a different way. When people visit\na website, what do they look at first, second, or third?\n\nExample of Eye Tracking (Figure 9.6)\nThe “Z” pattern is considered the most common way Americans read a\nweb page, starting across the top, from left to right, and then skimming\ndiagonally downward across the page. Eyes move at astounding speeds, and\nusers are known to spend as little as a few seconds scanning a page to find\nsomething of interest. It pays to put key content and invitations for user\ninteraction in the places where the users tend to go. (Keep in mind that web\npages in other languages may scan differently.)\nCopy Testing\nWhile copy isn’t a tool the way a heat map or an A/B test might be, using\nthose and other tools to test copy makes the “copy buffer” a very important\ntool. It’s almost axiomatic that no headline is ever the best possible headline,\nand there’s always a way to improve “sell” copy, offer copy, and the way you\nget people excited about your product, its features, and the reasons they\nshould buy. Copy testing can happen on the site, in focus groups, or through\nweb surveys. Bigger sites create alternate mirror sites to A/B-test different\ncopy versions. This is a powerful optimization tool.\nVisitors focus on headlines, highlighted words and\nbulleted lists but scan the text.\nNo matter how polished the prose or how many people edit the copy,\nfew visitors read all or even many of the words. Tests by industry expert\nJakob Nielsen suggest that most visitors focus on headlines, highlighted\nwords and bulleted lists but scan the text. He notes that the three most\neffective design elements are plain text, faces, and cleavage and other body\nparts.\nIn the next web/mobile section, you’ll strap on your e-toolbelt and go to\nwork, optimizing your “get” customers activities.\nChecklist 33: Prepare Optimization Plans And\nTools\nGoal: Prepare tools for testing the business model\nReference: Chapter 9, Customer Validation Phase 2: Get Out of the Building\nand Sell!\nOptimization metrics identified\nOptimization priorities set\nTesting tools in place\nDashboard for monitoring results\nHigh-Fidelity MVP\nAcquire plan, tools\nActivation plan, tools\nExit criteria:\nPlan that defines acquisition metrics to optimize\nPlan for how customer behavior will be monitored/optimized\nPass/Fail tests identified\nGet Out of the Building: Optimize Getting More\nCustomers\nIn the prior phase, you got basic lessons in web and mobile performance\noptimization, had some basic training in how optimization works, and\nreviewed the tools and techniques you’ll use to create your optimization\nstrategy. This phase takes that learning and puts it to work at the widest part\nof the “get customers” funnel—where customers come from—the acquire\nand activate steps of “get, keep and grow.”\nThe “Get Customers” Funnel in Web/Mobile Channels (Figure 9.7)\nFor some websites 98 percent of people who visit (“acquired”) never\never return. That means only two percent of acquired prospects have a chance\nof becoming a customer or user, even after you’ve spent many millions\nacquiring them. If that statistic doesn’t call attention to the need for\noptimizing activation efforts, nothing will!\n98 percent of people who visit never ever return...\nHow will Your Startup Optimize its “Get\nCustomers” Efforts?\nOptimization objectives vary by your business model. For example:\nSubscription products (e.g., software as a service) try to get customers to\nexplore, try, or use the product any way they’ll agree to do so, often with\nfreemium or low-cost trials\nExpensive products and services strive to ensure that customers will be\ndriven to, and continue to engage with, the appropriate sales channel\nInexpensive apps and games often try to sell as soon as they engage\ncustomers\nSocial networks will encourage first-timers to engage with the network,\nparticipating at least a few times to get “hooked,” and then to invite\nfriends\nMulti-sided market businesses try to attract users who will use the site\nfrequently, stay a long time, and bring their friends\nMarketplaces (think Etsy or eBay) encourage sellers to join, list multiple\nitems, and enjoy early success on the site\nPROCEED WITH CAUTION: Remember, this is an overview and a\ntutorial. There’s no way to implement or even process this in one sitting.\nHow to Run the “Get” Optimization Process\nReview the results of the “get” programs you’ve done to date, always asking\nyour data and team, which program:\n1. is most important to us? Start with the free “get” programs for because if\nthey’re working they are the easiest to scale up. Accelerate the most\nproductive program. If you’re getting tons of customers from SEO or\nbloggers, for example, start here to optimize that effort.\n2. is the most disappointing? When you launched your “get” programs,\nyou had great expectations for certain programs, whether it was an\nAdWords campaign, referrals to friends, natural search or a blimp flying\nover your city. Design pass/fail tests to improve the results.\n3. gives you the best customers? If, for example, an e-mail campaign gets\nyou customers who buy faster, spend more, or visit more often and stay\nlonger, you obviously want more of those folks. So prioritize the plan to\noptimize that program.\n4. gives you early customers with high lifetime value (LTV)? Get and seek\nmore that look like them. Identify high-LTV behavior (frequent visits,\npurchasing, posting or referrals, for example) in specific customers and\ntrack back to their source, demography, or other common traits. Then go\nfind more customers like them. This is hardest in the company’s early\ndays, when few customers exist and there’s less time to observe them.\nTest a wide range of offers, incentives, deals and\ndiscounts.\nFinally, test a wide range of offers, incentives, deals and discounts. While\nalternatives are almost as obvious as they are endless, here are a few to try:\nOffer a gift with purchase instead of a discount. Consider a time limit on the\noffer, as in “until midnight only” or “this week’s special.” Create limited\noffers, as in “for the first 500 to sign up.”\nAlways review the top 10 or 12 performance metrics daily, led by the\ndata chief recruited earlier. That’s a dozen metrics, not dozens—on the “get\ncustomers” program results. Prepare to be disappointed often, but the review\n—good or bad—always ends with the same question: “how do we improve\nit?”\nFor less experienced web marketers\nIf you’re not an experienced web/mobile marketer, and don’t know an\nimportant program from a disappointing one, try this approach instead. First,\nfocus on increasing the number of activations, since activations matter most.\n(If you’ve acquired only a handful or a few dozen visitors, start talking about\npossible pivots instead.)\nFind the largest single source of customers and figure out how to\nincrease the volume. How does more spending, improved creative, different\noffers or greater frequency improve the result? Test each one, one at a time,\nand often more than once per test.\nRemember, don’t optimize too many programs at once, or the results\nwill be confusing—you won’t be able to tell what worked and what didn’t.\nRecognize “getting customers” means that the acquire and activate programs\nwork hand in hand. You need both parts to work to truly “get” a customer...\nnot just someone who comes to your site or app, but who buys and engages.\nCommon Optimization Opportunities and Problems\nIf this book were to list every possible way to optimize getting customers, it\nwould be impossible to carry. The balance of this section addresses the most\ncommon problems where optimization can help—getting more clicks to your\nsite and more out of every click. Since we hear these questions from\nentrepreneurs so often, we’ve organized the approaches to optimization based\non the questions we hear most.\nProblem: I have a website but nobody visits...\nOther than perhaps CIA.gov, we don’t think there’s been a web business yet\nthat didn’t want more people exposed to its product or service, or more\nvisitors to its home page. Visitors are clearly the lifeblood of every\nweb/mobile business.\nDiagnosis: You are perilously close to extinction. There are tens of millions\nof websites, and just “being there” doesn’t drive traffic as a rule.\nYou are perilously close to extinction. Use every tool\nwe have described in the prior pages.\nSolution:\n1. Return to the start of “Get Customers” web/mobile. Read it again and\nget to work.\n2. Find more e-mails, Tweet more people, beg friends to invite their\nfriends, create a funny YouTube and try to viralize it.\n3. Consider changing the URL to something people will find more\nnaturally (your site’s promise, like “instantlove.com” rather than\n“socialdatinginc.com, for example).\n4. Pay the smartest people you can find to optimize your site for natural\nsearch in a hurry.\n5. Do something crazy.... big events, promotions, hand out flyers on street\ncorners, scream, set your hair on fire, but do it fast!\nTools to use: Use every tool we have described in the prior pages, then\ngo online and find dozens more. Start at www.steveblank.com for a thorough\nupdated list.\nProblem: Visitors come to my site or app, but don’t stay...\nThis common problem presents many optimization opportunities.\nDiagnosis: The most likely problem: something isn’t “clicking” with your\nvalue proposition and product positioning, so start testing alternate versions.\nThen look at the acquisition tactics you’re using and rank them based on\nproductivity (the most acquisitions with the least money or effort). Start with\nthe worst performing tactics and test alternatives.\nSolution:\n1. Start by changing your messaging, whether you’re using e-mail, banner\nads, or banners pulled by WWII biplanes.\n2. If it’s AdWords, for example, pause all programs and start over. Spend\nmore per click, change the geography or hours your keywords are active\nand for sure experiment by buying different AdWords and testing\nalternate ad copy.\n3. Test alternative calls to action. Offer something for free, whether it’s a\ntrial or a prize for visiting the site. And keep running this optimization\nprocess forever.\n4. Change the offer. If you’re offering annual signups, test monthly or\n“first 30 days free.” Develop other reasons why people should come\nvisit your site.\n5. Interview lots of customers face-to-face. Find out what they like and,\nmore important, what they don’t.\n6. Be sure you have multiple calls to action on the home page (like “take a\ntour,” “try now for free,” “learn more” and “get more info”).\nTools to Use: Copy testing, A/B testing, and another look at your value\nproposition messaging (unique selling proposition, features you’re\npromoting, introductory offer, to name a few).\nProblem: People Visit the Site, but don’t Click (no Activation)...\nDiagnosis: This deadly problem is often masked by “vanity metrics,” where\nthe team high-fives and celebrates because unique visitors and page views are\nincreasing every day. So what!! If people come to the site or app and don’t\nengage, try it, do something, sign up or pay up, your business is simply dead.\nPeriod.\nIf we just described your site, ring the alarm bell and if your “data chief”\nand marketing person aren’t sure what to do or test, it may be time to call in\n(preferably smart freelance) consultants, buy the tons of other books on\noptimization, and call home and tell’em you won’t be home for a while...\nyour business is at serious risk of implosion.\nSolution: Pull out all the stops, remembering not to test too many things all at\nonce. Start by talking to customers who’ve been acquired but not activated\n(hopefully you have some of their e-mails, but call or ask them to call you—\ndon’t just e-mail) and find out what was uninteresting or unappealing to them\n(that’s why it’s called Customer Development).\nThen start to implement some optimization tactics.\n1. Find the page where most users abandon ship. Start testing stronger calls\nto action and improved navigation on this page fast\n2. Test a variety of calls to action... click here to do this, sign up and get a\nfree...\n3. Do some heat mapping studies to see what people are looking at on the\npage, and move calls to action closer to where their eyeballs go\n4. Test bigger, smaller, or different calls to action: louder copy, bigger\nbuttons, maybe a blinking or brightly-colored “try now,” for example\n5. Be sure your “no spam” guarantee/promise is visible in every\ncommunication\n6. Conduct usability testing where you watch actual customers as they\nreview your home page. What questions do they ask, what do they click\non, do they get confused? Then ask them flat-out: “what don’t you like\nabout my site, product, or offer?”\n7. Buttons: Do more people click on a big ugly button or a small pink one?\nDo they like round or square, a midpage location or lower left?\n8. “Sell” and body copy: constantly test new copy versions to see which\ngets more response\n9. Graphics: Test alternative product pictures, illustrations, how-to\ngraphics and other elements to see better activations\nTools to Use: Every tool in the toolbox works overtime on this crisis.\nA/B test everything. Spend money on usability testing and one-on-one\ncustomer interviews. Use heat maps, magic tricks, anything you can find, as\nyour business is clearly threatened with extinction right now.\nProblem: We’re Getting Some Customers, but they don’t refer others...\nDiagnosis: While this is certainly a “get” customers problem, we consider it a\n“grow” problem and address it in the next section. After all, to be technical,\nfirst you have to acquire and activate a customer to “grow” him or her. There\nare two ways to “grow” a customer: get them to spend more, or to refer\nothers. Both are addressed in the next web/mobile section.\nProblem: People are engaging, but not doing what you want...\nDiagnosis: You’re getting good traffic, and people are clicking or at least\nviewing multiple pages. But nobody’s signing up, posting comments, playing\nthe game, adding pictures, spending money, or doing whatever you want\nthem to do.\nSolution: Once again, you need to put almost the entire optimization toolbox\nto work.\n1. Start with heat maps and eye tracking to see what people are actually\ndoing when they’re on the site\n2. Start A/B testing by first testing your calls to action. Make the graphics\ndifferent or bigger; consider adding demos or animation; Simplify the\nmessaging to make it clearer, and A/B test it both onsite and in person\n3. Develop more “pathways” through the site—make the navigation bigger\nand test providing at least a few more options (“read more,” “free trial,”\nand so forth)\n4. Can users easily sign up, post a comment, upload a picture, or buy\nsomething on the site? If not, fix it.\n5. Do users make lots of errors downloading the app, a pdf or a picture? If\nso, improve the process by rewriting the copy, adding graphics,\nshortening the instructions or adding a video.\n6. Does anybody remember your headline or “sell points” five minutes\nafter visiting? If not, test alternatives\n7. Be sure your company’s positioning and promise, plus endorsements or\nhappy user quotes are prominent on the site to give users comfort\nTools to use: Use the entire toolbox: heat maps, eye tracking, A/B\ntesting, customer interviews, usability testing and a magic wand will all help.\nChecklist 34: Optimize Getting Customers\nGoal: Optimize “get customers” effort\nReference: Chapter 9, Customer Validation Part 2: Get Out of the Building\nand Sell!\nCustomer Relationship hypotheses reviewed\nDozen metrics identified for testing, daily monitoring\nSequential plan for optimizing “get” funnel\nOptimization plan under way\nSpreadsheet for monitoring daily progress, next steps\nTest\nRetest\nTest again\nExit criteria: Quick, cost-effective, proven means for getting customers\nPass/Fail tests identified\nGet Out of the Building: Optimize “Keep” and\n“Grow”\nThe common wisdom is that it cost 10 times more to get a new customer\nthan to keep and grow an existing one. Now that your company has users or\ncustomers, this step optimizes how you “keep” and “grow” them. In the first\n“optimize” phase, you chose a set of optimization tools and a plan for\ndeploying them to improve the results of your “keep” and “grow” efforts.\nNow it’s time to put those plans into action. Believe us, this process is neverending.\nThe “Keep Customers” Funnel in Web/Mobile Channels (Figure 9.8)\nPROCEED WITH CAUTION: Remember, this is an overview and a\ntutorial. There’s no way to implement or even process this in one sitting.\nOptimizing “Keep” (or Customer Retention)\nPrograms\nLaunch at least some basic customer retention and growth programs, you\ndeveloped in the customer-relationship hypotheses: loyalty programs,\ncustomer check-in calls, customer-satisfaction surveys, product updates and\nupgrades, and close monitoring of customer complaints. Where possible\n(recognizing that it’s early and there aren’t many customers yet), monitor the\ncosts and return on investment for the programs individually to be sure\nthey’re incrementally profitable. Do customers in the “points” program spend\nmore and stay longer, for example?\nRemember that customer retention, or “keep” customers, begins with\ngreat products and customer service. Your customer-relationships hypothesis\nshould include a plan for testing at least a few of these programs now, during\ncustomer validation.\nHere are some things to watch for in the most common customer retention\nprograms, and ways to optimize the program results:\nUser outreach programs: What do customers say when you e-mail,\nTweet, or call them about their use of and satisfaction with the product?\nDo they even take your calls or answer your e-mails? If not, consider\ncalling instead of e-mailing, or testing more urgent/ambitious subject\nlines on your e-mails\nIf customers are responding in small numbers, add an incentive to\nstimulate response, such as “Tell us your opinion and get a free month’s\nservice just for speaking up.” When you get negative feedback, first\nrespond, and then tell all your customers, not just the complainers, that\nyou’ve listened and made the improvements your customers suggested\nLoyalty programs: First, are customers participating in the loyalty\nprogram? If not, are you marketing it ambitiously enough? A/B-test\nsome special sign-up offers, like “5,000 bonus points just for joining to\nget you started.” If you’re getting sign-ups, the next question is whether\nthe program creates incentive for the behavior you want, whether it’s\nmore active site use or more frequent purchasing. A/B-test different\nmessages, incentives, and promotions to get the most out of your\nloyalty-program participants\nContests and events: These can only help retention if people participate,\nso A/B-test, copy-test, and constantly refresh promotional campaigns\nboth on the site and through e-mail to users. Do your changes get more\npeople to participate? If not, keep testing. Over time (at least three\nweeks, maybe longer), monitor whether the use of these promotions and\ncontests is driving the behavior you want, be it more clicks, uploads,\ndownloads, or purchases. Keep A/B-testing new options forever!\nInformation feeds: Whether you’re using a blog, an RSS feed, e-mail or\nsmoke signals to keep your customers updated on product\nenhancements, how-to tips, or other helpful information, they’re of little\nhelp if nobody reads them. A/B-test a variety of ways of delivering the\nsame message, using different headlines and headline sizes, videos,\ncartoons, or diagrams. Consider making offers like “get bonus points for\nreading (or forwarding) our latest bulletins.” This exercise, like most\ncustomer-loyalty efforts, continues forever as well\nWatch the initial results of each program for perhaps a week or 10 days,\nat least at first (in reality, you’ll be watching and optimizing them\nindefinitely). Never look at the programs as a whole, since each keep activity\nwill operate independently.\nCohort Analysis Should Guide your “Keep” Efforts\nCohort analysis should guide retention efforts. A cohort is a group of\ncustomers with common attributes, and in the web/mobile channels, the key\ncohort to watch is the customer activation date. Why? New customers may\nstay for months, while older customers may tire after perhaps three or four\nmonths. New customers may visit 10 times a week, staying 20 minutes per\nvisit, while older customers visit twice a week for 10 minutes each time.\nMeasuring retention based on averages can be extremely deceptive,\nsuggesting, say, that retention is OK since we lose only 8 percent of our\ncustomers every month. But if those customers were all heavy users or\nspenders or all disappear in two months or five months, the company\nobviously has a problem. Studying users in terms of cohorts rather than in\na\ng\ng\nr\ne\ng\na\nt\ne\nm\na\nk\ne\ns\ni\nt\nm\nu\nc\nh\ne\na\ns\ni\ne\nr\nt\no\ns\np\no\nt\nd\na\nn\ng\ne\nr\ns\ni\ng\nn\ns.\nCohort Analysis of a Sales Funnel (Figure 9.9)\nAnother important cohort to consider (usually when there are at least\nmany thousands of customers) is users by source: do customers referred by\nGoogle stay longer than or not as long as those referred by Bing or Yahoo?\nDo customers who first accept a free trial leave more quickly than those who\npay from Day One? Each cohort analysis delivers a strategy for improving\nretention.\nOptimize “Grow” Customers\nThere are two ways to grow customers: get customers to buy more, or get\nthem to refer other customers to the company.\nThe optimization principles for growing new revenue are described in\nChapter 3 and can be helped by cohort analysis, described above.\n“Grow Customers” Activation Activities in Web/Mobile Channels\n(Figure 9.10)\nGet Customers to Buy More\nHere are key metrics to optimize when trying to grow revenues and\ncustomers:\nIncremental dollars (above initial order) sold, on average, to all\ncustomers: if you’re not getting at least 15 percent larger orders from\nrepeat customers, you’re not working hard enough. Experiment with\nmore and different offers, add more generous offers, and find additional\nplaces to make the offers\nThe “take rate:” This is the percentage of customers reviewing (and\ntaking) an upsell/next-sell offer. It tells you how well the upsell is\nworking. Aim for a double-digit take rate even though it may not always\nbe achievable. A/B-test more generous offers and spontaneous offers\nthat seem urgent (“24-hour sale” or “today only”), and (see above) find\nother innovative places, media, and ideas for promoting upsells\nAverage order size: Also called “market basket” (a century-old term\nborrowed from the physical channel). Make the order bigger by A/Btesting a variety of offers, such as longer-term subscriptions, “bonus”\nproducts for people taking the upsell offer, and deeper discounts on the\nupsell. Remember you’ve already spent the “big” money acquiring this\ncustomer, so accept a more narrow margin on these incremental\nrevenues\nNumber of opt-outs or closed accounts resulting from additional offers:\nThis is an important “watch out” number that’ll quickly tell you if\nyou’re being too pushy. Look at your overall opt-out rate, and if these\ngrow offers increase that rate by 25 percent or more (it should be around\n2 percent or 3 percent), either slow down your efforts, tone down your\ncopy, or call some customers and find out what they liked and didn’t\nlike and adjust accordingly\nYou’ll be amazed how delighted many customers\nwill be to receive an e-mail or, better yet, a phone\ncall.\nCustomer Satisfaction: Getting existing customers to buy more starts by\nensuring that they’re satisfied with the product, its performance and the\nprice. Unhappy customers won’t be buying from you again. Stay in\ntouch with your customers through regular satisfaction surveys, outreach\nphone calls, and the like\nYou’ll be amazed how delighted many customers will be to receive an\ne-mail or, better yet, a phone call saying, “Hi, we just want to thank you for\nyour business and find out how you’re liking our product.” You can usually\ngently slide in a special offer or a discount on more purchases toward the end\nof the call or e-mail. These basic customer-growth strategies work in\nconsumer goods as well as business-to-business.\nGet Customers to Refer Other Customers\nCustomer referrals are by far the most powerful, leverageable opportunities to\nget more customers and thus increase revenue. Why? Because invitations\nfrom one friend to another saying “try this” are highly credible and often free.\nReferral metrics to optimize include:\npercentage and number of customers sending e-mails, Tweets, messages\nto friends\naverage number of referrals per customer\nconversion (or acceptance) rate of customer referral offers\npurchases, activations, or sign-ups per user and per member referred by\nother members or customers\nMany of the viral marketing techniques discussed earlier, such as getting\nusers to “like” the company on Facebook or re-Tweet news of a new game or\napp, adds the friend’s credibility and endorsement to your marketing\nmessage. Most consumers prefer to get messages from friends rather than\nmarketers, knowing their friends wouldn’t tout something of little interest.\nStart with Two “Grow” Metrics\nTwo metrics guide the monitoring of “Grow” efforts: viral growth factor and\ncustomer lifetime value.\nThe viral growth factor, or viral coefficient, helps measure the number\nof activated users referred by your current users. If a user invites five friends\nbut only one actually activates and buys from or signs up for your site, your\nviral coefficient is 1.0 (one user refers one activated new user, or 1 for 1), the\nminimum for real viral growth. Think about it—you’d actually double your\naudience if every customer got you one more activated customer!!\nHow do you calculate your viral coefficient?\nHere’s an example. Imagine 100 users of your site each refer 10 friends\nwho come to your site or app delivering 1,000 “acquired” users lucky\nyou). Now imagine if 15 percent of those invited friends (150) actually\nsign up, buy, or engage (making them activated users).\nCalculations:\n1. Start with the number of users (100)\n2. Multiply users by the average number they referred (100×10)\n3. Then compute the average conversion to “activated” users (15%)\n4. You now have 150 new users (15% of 1,000 have activated)\n5. The result = 150 new users divided by 100 “old” users equal a viral\ncoefficient of 1.5\nWork to achieve a viral coefficient greater than 1.2 or 1.3, which is\ncloser to linear or modest growth and not dramatic. Ideally, you’ll experience\nthe kind of explosive growth seen from a top YouTube video, a hilarious\njoke, or a scam e-mail like “get a free iPad.” Many people forward hilarious\nYouTube videos or jokes to dozens of people or more, many of whom watch\nthe video or read the joke. This can deliver superb viral coefficients of 12, 20,\nor even more. The higher the coefficient, the faster the resulting viral growth\nand the more customers you’re adding at any given time. With any viral\ncoefficient below 1, you’re stagnant at best.\nA top YouTube video or a hilarious joke can deliver\nsuperb viral coefficients.\nBe careful to measure activated users, not just gross referrals, which can\ndeceive you. What good is it if a customer brings 10 people to a store, for\nexample, and they sure do like the fashion, but none spend a dime?\nThe work to increase a viral coefficient is hard—very hard—because it’s\nthe greatest single source of new customers at the lowest possible cost. Use\nall the tactics we’ve already described, including:\nA/B test the offer, the copy, the calls to action\nCreate and test incentives, promotions, deals and discounts\nTest a variety of incentives to encourage people to refer their friends...\nbe sure to incentivize both the current and the potential customer\nApply the core “get customers” tactics to every step in this process,\nsince while this is a referral, it’s all about getting a new customer\nRecognize, too, that nothing creates great virality better than a great\nproduct! Not lots of people go out of their way to tell any of their friends\nabout a boring company with mediocre products and service. Monitor the\nviral growth factor at least weekly, constantly brainstorming ways to improve\nthe score.\nOptimization never ends.\nKeep in mind that not all products on the web are viral. Social media is\nviral. Multiplayer games are viral. But there are sites in some categories that\nyou definitely don’t invite lots of friends to (dating sites, spouse-cheating\nsites, legal and illegal drug sites, etc.). YouTube is perhaps the canonical\nexample of a high-coefficient site. Think about the last hilarious YouTube\nvideo you viewed. How many friends did you forward it to?\nCustomer lifetime value (LTV), or how much the customer is worth to\nthe company, can grow in several different ways: a customer buys more,\nrefers more new customers or, in the case of multi-sided markets, become\nmore active on the site and generate greater revenue for the company. “Grow\ncustomers” programs are the primary driver of lifetime value growth.\nMonitor LTV growth over time, and use new programs and offers and\nimprove efficiency.\nMulti-sided Markets Must Optimize the “Other\nSide”\nAs discussed earlier, startups operating multi-sided markets need to optimize\nthe “other side” of their market, the side that generates cash. It’s time to get\nout of the building and verify the hypothesis that certain advertisers find the\naudience attractive and will pay the CPM ad rates that the hypothesis\nindicates will drive a profitable business model.\nWhile orders would be lovely at this point, the primary objective is\nvalidation of the potential revenue so glowingly described in the hypothesis\nand your pitch to investors.\nFollow the “get customers” processes outlined earlier (you are getting\ncustomers, after all), recognizing that you basically have to do most of the\nwork a second time. Why? The acquisition activities and sales pitch to the\npayer side of a market are totally different from the materials, positioning,\nand value proposition that attracts free users to the site or app. Don’t expect\norders or revenue yet, since traffic will be negligible, but:\nLearn the rules of the game: Does the site need to have a million page\nviews a week or a month in order to be considered? Are certain ad units\nor features required? Is the audience distinctive enough to command an\nad-rate premium? Are there any other rules about content, longevity, or\nanything else that might prevent a deal?\nDetermine the sales roadmap: How long does it take to get an order, and\nhow many steps does the approval process involve? Does the advertiser\nmake its buys once or twice a year or on an ongoing basis? How big are\ntypical initial insertion orders? Who needs to approve the site, the price,\nthe content? How might you get an order sooner?\nSummary: Optimization never ends!\nChecklist 35: Optimize “Keep” And “Grow”\nResults\nGoal: Improve methods for retaining and “growing” customers\nReference: Chapter 9, Customer Validation Part 2: Get Out of the Building\nand Sell!\nBasic customer retention and growth programs launched\nCosts, ROI monitored for each\nCohort analysis under way\nTwo “Grow” metrics\nViral Growth Factor\nCustomer Lifetime Value\n“Other side” of multi-sided market also optimized\nLearn how “other side” works, buys\nDetermine sales roadmap for “other side”\nRevenue model refined based on learning from optimization efforts\nExit criteria:\nOptimized “keep” and “grow” processes\nValidated sales potential of app or site\nPass/Fail tests identified\nGet Out of the Building: Test Sell Traffic Partners\nIt’s not uncommon to hear, “Well, I built a website, but nobody came to\nit.” This is the death knell for a startup in the web/mobile channel. You need\npartners to drive traffic to your site, whether they run textlinks to you, post\nbanner ads encouraging their visitors to visit you, or highlight some of your\ncontent or even your features on their site with links to yours. A wide variety\nof partnerships can be used to increase traffic. In web companies, the\nfunction is often called “business development.”\nA few examples of the types of partnerships:\nA social network might get traffic from other related commerce or\ncontent websites\nA kid-game company might offer a free trial version on kid-oriented\nwebsites\nA computer parts e-tailer might get traffic from computer-news sites\nMeet prospective partners and try to sign the traffic deals you envisioned\nin the traffic-partners hypothesis. If you do, how much revenue or traffic will\nthey actually deliver, and at what cost? Set up meetings with sites that reach\nthe same types of customers you want to reach and start making deals like\nthese:\nFeature content from each other’s sites with links to the partner’s site.\nSwap e-mail lists so each partner can introduce its users or customers to\nthe other\nTrade ads and textlinks on your partner’s site for those on your own,\nusing unsold inventory at each site\nHighlight the partner as a “content partner” or otherwise promote each\nother on site\nCreate microsites with noncompetitive content or offers on each other’s\nsites\nOffer one site’s features (social networking or free games, for example)\non the other\nThe list of traffic opportunities is virtually endless and provides a great\ncreative challenge that can deliver massive incremental traffic to one partner\nor both. When one partner benefits more than the other, cash often brings the\ntrade back into balance. Cash offers are the best way to get a prospective\npartner’s attention. Use your initial conversations to compare the potential\nvolume and cost of partner-delivered revenue or traffic with the traffic your\ncompany generates on its own. Get some traffic partnerships going as fast as\nyou can, and monitor and evaluate the results.\nPartnership opportunities are viewed as a dime a\ndozen.\nIdentify your target partners from lists developed in the traffic-partner\nhypothesis. Recognize that these meetings are largely exploratory in nature,\nsince the first question a prospective partner is likely to ask is “How much\ntraffic do you have now?” and the answer is probably very close to zero at\nthis stage of the validation process. After all, most partnerships are mutually\nbeneficial, and before scheduling a meeting, the partner candidate is likely to\nwant to understand what’s in it for him or her.\nThese meetings are hard to get. Partnership opportunities are viewed as\na dime a dozen, and companies are reluctant to spend time on all but the\nbiggest opportunities. Some tips for breaking through the barrier:\nUse personal referrals and aggressive follow-up as described in the\n“customer contacts” section of customer discovery\nFocus the introductory e-mail on what’s in it for the potential partner.\nThis might include traffic, money, or new customers, depending on how\nthe partnership works\nExplain your startup’s vision and why partnering with your new\ncompany is important\nNetwork at appropriate conferences and trade shows to meet partners\nface-to-face\nNot every deal needs to be signed in these initial meetings, especially\nsince these commitments are hard to come by\nCreate a post-meeting report card that assesses and estimates the size of\nthe opportunity: how much traffic, and how much cost. Use a report card to\ntrack and quantify results.\nChecklist 36: Test Sell Traffic Partners\nGoal: Validate your traffic partner strategy\nReference: Chapter 9, Customer Validation Part 2: Get Out of the Building\nand Sell!\nTraffic partner targets identified and researched\nMeetings scheduled\nIntroductory e-mail\nReference story and script\nReport card for estimating sales from each channel\nSpreadsheet for summarizing data\nExit criteria\nDeals or firm commitments from prospective traffic partners\nPass/Fail tests identified\n\nCHAPTER 10\nCustomer Validation, Phase Three: Develop\nProduct and Company Positioning\nIN THIS PHASE OF CUSTOMER VALIDATION, you’ll use all the test results from\nyour experiments about customers, their reactions to the initial value\nproposition, and why they buy. The result is two positioning statements: one\nfor the company and one for the product. In this phase, you’ll:\ndevelop product positioning\nmatch product positioning to market type\ndevelop a company positioning\nmake presentations to analysts and industry influencers to validate the\npositioning\nPositioning is the attempt to control the public’s perception of a product\nor service as it relates to competitive products. In Phase 1 of validation, you\ncrafted initial positioning for product and company, but formal positioning at\nthat time would have involved too much guesswork. Now, with 50 or 250\nface-to-face customer interviews and thousands of online customer\ninteractions under your belt, the company has real facts about why customers\nbuy and real customers to help further test and refine your positioning.\nThus far, even through the validation stage, spending on customer\nacquisition has been modest and the risks relatively low. But now, as the\ncompany prepares to scale from dozens or hundreds of customers to\nthousands or even millions, it needs to be able to communicate what the\nproduct is and does, and why the customer should buy or use it.\nNo PR Agency\nMost technology-driven startups believe they need professional “marketing\npeople” from a public relations agency to execute this positioning phase. In\nreality, the first pass is best-done (and far more affordably) by the Customer\nDevelopment team with feedback from Product Development. At this\nmoment, no one is closer to the customer or better understands what\nproblems customers say the product solves. No one else has struggled to learn\ncustomers needs, get an order, and find a repeatable sales process. The\nCustomer Development team is clearly best-qualified to develop a first pass\nat describing what makes the company and the product unique. Later, during\ncustomer creation, it’ll be time to bring in the “experts” and their monthly\nretainers and invoices. By then you’ll be able to hand them facts explaining\nwhy customers bought.\nThe Positioning Audit\nBefore the company spends time on positioning, it’s a good idea to air out the\nconference room and get some facts. The best way to do this is with a\npositioning audit. An audit is an unbiased way to learn how others perceive\nyour company and products. An external audit interviews a representative\nsample of people from a variety of categories, including customers who know\nor have heard of your company and those who don’t; others who will carry\nyour message for you (industry analysts and influencers, bloggers, members\nof the press, and others); competitors and others who are knowledgeable\nabout the industry or market.\n\nExample of an External Audit Questionnaire (Figure 10.1)\nEach interview asks these groups a series of questions about how they\nperceive your company and its key competitors: Do they know and respect\nyour product, your reputation, and your leadership? Do they think your\ncompany is a credible, trustworthy provider of the product or service it’s\nselling, and where do they think it fits in the competitive set? The results\nform a baseline of the perceptions others have about your company.\nForm a baseline of the perceptions others have\nabout your company.\nOnce you understand what others think (usually a surprise to most\nstartups breathing the rarefied air of their own conference rooms), the\ncompany can work on changing and shaping those opinions. An example of\nan external audit questionnaire for customers, press, influencers, and analysts\nis shown in Figure 10.1.\nWhile conducting an audit is the kind of activity pr agencies excel at,\nhanding this function off completely is a serious mistake in a startup. Just as\nyour early sales calls were too important to be handled by salespeople, your\nearly audits are too important to be handed off to a pr agency. The members\nof the founding team should at least perform the first five or ten calls\nthemselves.\nListening to external perceptions of the company is half of this audit\nstep. Listening inside the company is the other half. An internal audit directs\nthe same questions to the founding team executive staff and board members.\nMost startups assume they have complete internal unanimity on the all the\nissues in the external audit. An internal audit will probably reveal that you\nhave a cacophony of voices (and you most definitely don’t want to be out of\nsync with your investors.) The internal audit should unearth those differences\nand extract new ideas. When the company has agreed on a final positioning at\nthe end of this phase, you communicate those ideas back to the entire\norganization so it speaks with one voice.\nDevelop Positioning: Product Positioning\nIn this step you’ll put a stake in the ground and formalize the product’s\npositioning. The positioning doesn’t have to be perfect, since it will be\nrefined further during customer creation. The result of this productpositioning step is a one-page “product positioning brief” that updates the\npositioning briefs developed earlier. As sales literature (data sheets, sales\npresentations, website and copy) and marketing campaigns are created, this\nbrief should be used to keep all the messages “on point.”\nFeedback from customers and channel partners in customer discovery\nand customer validation has continually refined or affirmed the answer to\nwhat your positioning is. You wrote your first version of a positioning\nstatement when you created the sales presentation, answering the question of\nwhy an early customer should buy the product. Think about customers’\nreaction to that description. Did it generate excitement? Was it credible? If\ncustomers couldn’t or didn’t explain why the product was interesting to them\n—or not—do you understand why? If not, re-contact them and find out the\nreasons. There’s no better input into product positioning than feedback from\nfolks who were exposed to the product itself.\nThe Product Positioning Brief\nReturn to the simple, single-phrase positioning statement you developed at\nthe outset of customer validation (remember “Absolutely positively\novernight” from FedEx?). Did it resonate with the customers encountered\nduring the validation process? Did they find think it explained why they\nshould buy the product or what it did, and did they find it credible and\neffective? If not, back to the drawing board.\nTo refresh your memory, review product positioning example developed\nearly in Chapter 8 (which may have been several months ago by now):\nExample of Product Positioning (Figure 10.2)\nA thorough positioning effort made soon after customer-validation\ninterviews will often save the company time and money at the start of\ncustomer creation. If it already knows how to position the new product\nagainst competition in a way that resonates with customers, it can hire a pr or\nmarketing communications agency and have it get right to work creating buzz\nor promotional materials or both. Neither time nor dollars are wasted on\nponderous, costly positioning studies and analyses. Instead, the agency is told\n“here’s the positioning. Run with it unless you have a significantly better\nidea.” The agency will know how to package the product, the pr messages,\nand other marketing communications tools and can get right to work\ngenerating results. (Agencies hate this, because thinking and “strategizing”\nare far more lucrative and less accountable activities.)\nProduct Positioning by Market Type (Table 10.1)\nChecklist 37: Develop Product Positioning\nGoal: Formalize your product’s positioning by Market Type\nReference: Chapter 10, Customer Validation, Phase 3: Product Development\nand Company Positioning\nInitial product positioning brief reviewed\nCustomer feedback factored in\nProduct positioning updated and refined\nExit criteria:\nRevised product positioning brief\nDevelop Positioning: Match Positioning to Market\nType\nMarket type dramatically changes the messages your company wants to send\nabout itself and its products. So now it’s time to match the positioning to the\nmarket type you’ve selected.\nFor an Existing Market\nIf you’re entering an existing market, company positioning is about creating\nthe notion that your company is both different and credible. And solves a\nproblem that customers believe is important. When Apple entered the\nsmartphone market, people understood that the company was a manufacturer\nof iPods but was now going to offer a phone and a web browser, too.\nOnce your company positioning is chosen, product positioning follows.\nSince in an existing market comparable products exist, product positioning\ntypically describes how and why your product is different along an existing\naxis/basis of competition. Differentiation in an existing market can take one\nof three forms: you can describe differences in product attributes (faster,\ncheaper, less filling, 30 percent more), in distribution channel (pizza in 30\nminutes, home delivery, see your nearest dealer, build it yourself on the web),\nor in service (five-year, 50,000-mile automobile warranty, 90-day moneyback guarantee, lifetime warranty). Or it can take the form of how the product\nfills a need or solves a problem the customer was searching for.\nFor a New Market\nIf you’re creating a new market, company positioning can’t be about how\ndifferent your company is, since by definition there are no other companies to\ncompare it with in a new market. So in a new market, company positioning is\nabout communicating a vision of and passion for what could be. It answers\nthe questions “What’s wrong with the world that you want to make right?”\nand “What is it that your company is trying to change?” When Airbnb\nreinvented hotel/motel/bed and breakfasts with “peer-to-peer”\naccommodations, they first had to communicate a radical idea: people would\nwant to rent out their homes to strangers who would want to stay in other\nstrangers’ homes.\nAfter positioning the company, positioning the product in a new market\nbecomes pretty simple. Touting a new product’s features is unproductive,\nsince there’s no context for understanding them—no comparable products\nexist—and customers have no idea what you’re talking about. If Airbnb had\npositioned its service as “rooms for $89” or “sleep in a stranger’s bed” no one\nwould have had a clue what it was talking about. Instead, Airbnb positioning\ntalked about a “sharing economy” and emphasized the economic benefits for\nboth parties.\nIn a Clone Market\nCloning a business model from the U.S. that hasn’t made it to your country\n(due to language, cultural or legal barriers) is a viable business strategy.\nClones are typically found in countries such as China, Russia, Brazil, India\nand Indonesia that are large enough to grow companies to substantial size\n(greater than 100 million people).\nCompany positioning can’t be about how different your company is, as\nthere are no other companies in your country to compare it with, but you can\nact as if you can predict the future. You know how the equivalent companies\nare positioned in the U.S. Clone their positioning.\nThe same is true for product positioning. Touting a new product’s\nfeatures is unproductive at first, as there’s no immediate context for\nunderstanding the features—no comparable products exist—and customers\nhave no idea what you’re talking about. But here again you can pretend to be\npsychic. You know how the equivalent companies are positioned in the U.S.\nAs soon as the market is educated, clone their positioning.\nFor Re-Segmenting a Market\nIf you’re re-segmenting an existing market, company positioning depends on\nmarket segmentation. Segmentation means you’ve picked a clear and distinct\nspot in customers’ minds that’s unique and understandable. Most important,\nconcerns something they value and want and need now. Company positioning\nfor this market type communicates your deep understanding of customer\nproblems/needs for un-or underserved markets. And your astute\nunderstanding of how to uniquely solve it.\nThere are two types of market re-segmentation; a segmented niche and a\nlow-cost provider. Two examples of low-cost re-segmentation are Jetblue and\nSouthwest Airlines. Both offer cheap fares matched by minimal frills, they\nentered the airline business low-cost passenger airlines that provide highquality customer service on point-to-point routes.\nThere are two types of market re-segmentation; a\nsegmented niche and a low-cost provider.\nThe rise of Walmart was another example of an entrepreneur’s\nrecognition that an existing market was ripe for a niche re-segmentation. In\nthe 1960s and ’70s, Sears and Kmart dominated big-box discount retailing,\nopening large stores where there was sufficient population to sustain them.\nSmaller communities got catalog stores (Sears) or were simply ignored\n(Kmart). Sam Walton saw towns dismissed as “too small” as an opportunity.\n“Small towns first” was his unique niche re-segmentation. Once established,\nWalmart proudly positioned itself as a “discounter”—a sobriquet the large\nretailers avoided like the plague. They sold name-brand health and beauty\naids at cost. This strategy, supported by heavy advertising, pulled in\ncustomers who then bought other products which, while priced low, carried\nhigh gross margins. Equally important, Walmart adoption of cutting-edge\ntechnology to track how people shop and to buy, and its ability to deliver\ngoods more efficiently and cheaply reduced its cost of sales to a small\nfraction of competitors’. By 2002, Kmart was bankrupt and Walmart was the\nlargest company in the world.\nWhen you’re re-segmenting a market, product positioning is a hybrid of\nmarket and existing market positionings. Since your segmentation has moved\nyour product into a space adjacent to your competitors, product positioning\ndescribes how and why your new segment is different and important to your\ncustomers.\nChecklist 38: Match Positioning To Market Type\nGoal: Ensure product positioning matches company’s market type\nReference: Chapter 10, Customer Validation, Phase 3: Product Development\nand Company Positioning\nExisting and Re-segmented Markets: Product compared to its\ncompetitors’\nNew Market: Vision and passion of what could be communicated\nClone Market: Knowledge of comparative firms used to “predict the\nfuture”\nExit criteria:\nEnsure product position matches market type\nValidate positioning with customers\nDevelop Positioning: Company Positioning\nWith the product positioned in one of the four market types, articulate\ncompany positioning the same way. What’s the difference between product\npositioning and company positioning? Product positioning focused on the\nspecific product attributes within a market type, while company positioning\nanswers the questions “What does this company do for me?” and “Why do I\nwant to do business with them?” and “Why does this company exist and how\nis it different?”\nWrite the first version of a company positioning statement as simply as\npossible, always keeping customers in mind. Describe the company to\nencourage potential customers to say, “Tell me more. It sounds like you’re\nsolving a problem I have.”\nHere’s a great but verbose example from Amazon.com: “We seek to be\nEarth’s most customer-centric company for three primary customer sets:\nconsumer customers, seller customers, and developer customers.” UPS points\nto its breadth: “As the world’s largest package delivery company and a\nleading global provider of specialized transportation and logistics services,\nUPS continues to develop the frontiers of logistics, supply chain\nmanagement, and e-Commerce, ...combining the flows of goods, information,\nand funds.” One more, from the simpler, more narrowly focused Zappos,\nspeaks volumes about why you’d want to do business with the company:\n“We’ve aligned the entire organization around one mission: to provide the\nbest customer service possible. Internally, we call this our WOW\nphilosophy.” Notice, that company positioning is not about product or\nfeatures.\nSometimes, founders creating a new market are tempted to name the\nnew market. This can be helpful or, more often, dangerous and expensive.\nGenerally it’s helpful only if it helps explain the product’s attributes, with\nterms like handheld video game or instant photography. If the new market\nname is cute or esoteric, prepare to spend lots of money explaining the\nmarket and why it’s important to customers, who need a frame of reference to\nunderstand the company positioning. No-frills airlines and movies on demand\nexplain markets and position new companies within them. Tivo spent\nhundreds of millions convincing customers it wasn’t a digital VCR.\nTable 10.2 illustrates company positioning by market type. Like product\npositioning, company positioning doesn’t have to be perfect yet, since it will\nbe refined further during customer creation.\nCompany Positioning by Market Type (Table 10.2)\nAs with product positioning, the result of this exercise should be a\n“company positioning brief,” brief being the operative word. As marketing\nliterature (press backgrounder, sales presentations, website) unfolds, this brief\nwill be used in conjunction with the product brief for consistency’s sake.\nAs a consistency check for company positioning, revisit the mission\nstatement written during customer discovery. How did customers react to it\nduring validation interviews? Did they find that explained why the company\nis different or special and encourage them to do business with the company?\nIn addition, compare the company’s description and mission statement with\nthose of its competitors. What are their company positionings, and is the new\ncompany’s positioning distinct or differentiated, particularly as buyers are\nconcerned. Is it simple? Beware: unsubstantiated superlatives like easiest,\nbest and greatest are meaningless. Demonstrable, provable claims like fastest\nand cheapest are stronger, although cheapest is a high-risk strategy as a rule,\nsince competition can quickly respond.\nUnsubstantiated superlatives like easiest, best and\ngreatest are meaningless. Demonstrable, provable\nclaims like fastest and cheapest are stronger.\nChecklist 39: Develop Company Positioning\nGoal: Articulate Company Positioning\nReference: Chapter 10, Customer Validation, Phase 3: Product Development\nand Company Positioning\nMission statement developed in Customer Discovery revisited\nCompany description, mission statement compared to competitors’\nCompany positioning statement drafted\nSimple\nKeeps customers in mind\nWhat Company does for me\nWhy do I want to do business with them?\nWhy does this company exist and how is it different?\nMatched to Market Type\nExit criteria:\nStatement that fully articulates the Company’s vision and mission\nDevelop Positioning: Validate Positioning\nIndustry analysts and influencers help deliver the foundation of credibility\nthat a startup needs. What’s an industry analyst? In the technology arena,\nmany firms charge customers to provide an “independent” and dispassionate\nanalysis of markets, trends, or specific products and their fit in those markets.\nThese firms vary in size and influence. In some technical markets (enterprise\nsoftware, for example) sales to large companies are very difficult until one of\nthe large analyst firms (Gartner, Forrester, Yankee) has blessed the product,\nparticularly if it’s new. In the entertainment business it might be Kagan, in\nconsumer products the NPD group.\nUnlike analysts, industry influencers are a less formal category. Every\nindustry has a handful of pundits who publish articles, write blogs or hold\nconferences, and their prominence in the field influences what gets talked\nabout. Sometimes these influentials work at industry-leading companies but\nspeak at lots of conferences. Other influentials include writers at general,\nbusiness, or trade publications. Sometimes they teach at universities.\nTest to see if they’ll sing your company song.\nIdentification of key analysts and industry influencers began in customer\ndiscovery. Meet them and get their insights and feedback on the initial\npositioning (market, product, and company) just created and their thoughts\nabout product features. Test to see if they’ll sing your company song (and if\nnot, figure out why). Even though early adopters will be evangelizing the\nproduct inside their company or to their friends and family, it helps to have\nother “outsiders” who will say, “Yes, we’ve heard of them, and while it’s too\nearly to say how good their product is, we think their idea is quite valuable.”\nIt’s also important to line up industry analysts and influencers as references\nfor press interactions in the customer creation step.\nAll this would have been difficult without real customer contacts,\nfeedback, and orders, but now it’s appropriate to contact the analysts and\ninfluencers who have been tracked since early on in customer discovery.\nHopefully, their names were recorded in a database after the company met\nthem at conferences, seminars, and trade shows. Before any meeting, the\nteam should spend time understanding their opinions on the market and\nproduct space (if not, don’t use the meetings in this phase to get up to speed;\ndo the homework first).\nBefore contacting analysts and influencers, be sure to understand what\ncompanies and industries their firms cover and what particular area or\ncompanies the individual analysts cover. (There’s nothing worse than seeing\nthe wrong person or even the wrong company. It tells everyone that nobody\ndid their homework.) Develop a short script explaining why they should\nmeet. Understand what they cover and explain why the new company will\nshake up their market and why the product and company are important. With\nthis accomplished, the “what’s in it for them” is obvious; they won’t want to\nmiss an influential and important company. (They’ll almost certainly also try\nto sell their consulting services, which at least theoretically have no bearing\non their opinion about the new client’s product.) Make sure to reference early\ncustomers and the problem/pain points that the product solves for them.\nWhen they agree to meet, ask how much time they’ll allocate, what\npresentation format they like (formal slides, demo, whiteboard talk, etc.) and\nwhether the presentation should focus on technology, markets, customers,\nproblems, or all the above.\nEach analyst organization or influencer has a view\nof the market or products it covers.\nAssemble the presentation, keeping in mind this isn’t a sales pitch.\nFocus on market and product positioning as well as details of product\nfeatures. The objective is to validate the product and company positions and,\nwherever possible, to influence analysts’ thinking, not to sell them. Each\nanalyst organization or influencer has a view of the market or products it\ncovers—understand that view upfront (know it well enough to draw it on the\nboard). If creating a new market, get the slides describing its view of the\nadjacent markets it will affect.\nMeeting an industry influencer may require the same formal preparation\nas meeting an analyst, or it may be a lunch at a nearby pub. Do the homework\nto understand how the influencers acquire and disseminate information\nupfront, and adjust presentation length and style accordingly.\nWhen meeting influencers and analysts, remember that the goal is to\ngather feedback (and hope for wild enthusiasm). Also use the interaction to\ngather intelligence about the marketplace. Make a mental checklist of critical\nlearning objectives. For example:\nWhat other companies are doing anything similar?\nHow does the new company’s vision fit with market needs?\nWith customer needs?\nHow can the company best position its product, its place in the market,\nand the company itself?\nIs the product pricing right?\nHow does it compare with competitors’ pricing?\nThe analysts can often clarify who in a company the sale should be\nmade to and the kinds of obstacles that will be faced. With feedback from\nanalysts and influencers as well several real customers, continue to the next\nand final phase of customer validation.\nChecklist 40: Validate Positioning\nGoal: Validate product and company positioning, and product features\nReference: Chapter 10, Customer Validation, Phase 3: Product Development\nand Company Positioning\nMeetings arranged with key analysts, industry influencers\nTargets tracked and monitored since Customer Discovery\nAnalysts’ reports, press clippings, websites, etc., researched\nScript developed\nAnalyst presentation assembled\nMarket and product positioning\nProduct feature details\nReport card for gathering intelligence, tracking feedback\nExit criteria:\nDetailed feedback about the marketplace and product from key analysts\nand influencers\n\nCHAPTER 11\nCustomer Validation, Phase Four: The\nToughest Question of All: Pivot or Proceed?\nTHIS IS THE MOST CRITICAL, MOST GUT-WRENCHING phase of customer\nvalidation: honestly determining whether there’s a scalable, profitable\nbusiness model ahead. Is the company ready to go forward to the customer\ncreation step, when millions of dollars are often spent to fuel rapid customer\ngrowth? This step literally “calls the question” about the company’s future\ndirections. It’s time to study all the test results, all the customer learning and\nall the insights you’ve had from the facts you’ve gathered. Its time to see if\nthe company is ready to start spending money to scale, and that the result will\nbe a great, profitable company.\nThere are three steps to answering the crucial “pivot or proceed” question:\nAssemble and review all key discovery and validation findings\nReview the business model hypotheses and their interactions with one\nanother\nFocus on the “metrics that matter” in the financial model\nPivot or Proceed: Assemble Data Findings\nBy this point, the team has assembled a massive amount of hard data:\nindustry research, customer segments, customer feedback, marketing\nprogram results, channel and cost input and much more. The data needs to be\nverified, with any gaps, discrepancies, or anomalies filled in along the way. A\nfew examples:\nThe company needs 10,000 customers in order to be profitable, but the\nmarket isn’t that large\nCustomer acquisition or channel costs are too high, rendering the\ncompany unprofitable\nThe sales roadmap is too long and complex, making the cost of sales\nway too high\nDespite best efforts, referrals just aren’t delivering additional customers\nThese anomalies are relatively easy to spot when all the data is collected\nin one room. They often call for further customer, channel, or product\ndevelopment discussions. At times, they drive a business model pivot.\nThe best way to “translate” piles of data, is to make\nit as visual as possible.\nBuild a War Room\nThe best way to “translate” piles of data, reports and questionnaires is to\nmake it as visual as possible. For best results, lock the founding team in a\nroom for a day or two to walk step by step through each hypothesis. Cover\none wall with a blown up “final” business model canvas. Cover the other wall\nwith the hypotheses themselves, sorted to keep the pieces of each hypothesis\ntogether (remember, many hypotheses have multiple parts). Use another wall\nfor supporting diagrams, and allow space for the most recent canvas and\nperhaps one or two earlier iterations. Leave a large whiteboard available for\nkeeping score of questions and changes and for the key “metrics that matter”\nnumbers that emerge (discussed in detail in Step 3). While not every diagram\nis appropriate for your startup, review:\na work-flow map of the prototypical customer that diagrams how\ncustomers do their jobs or live their lives both with and without the new\nproduct\nan organizational/influence map showing whom consumers or\nbusinesspeople interact with, how often, and how those people influence\nbuying decisions.\ncustomer archetypes: how they earn and spend their money and use their\ntime\na market map showing where your customers will come from\na channel or sales roadmap diagramming how sales will happen\na fully updated business model canvas (along with a few earlier\nversions)\nReview the Data\nThe most important hard data to review includes:\ncustomer feedback, particularly from sales report cards evaluating\ncustomer enthusiasm for the product and its potential sales revenue over\ntime\nmarket size and market share estimates\nchannel feedback and revenue potential summaries\npricing, customer acquisition costs, and any major product cost changes\ndetailed information about the industry, the customers, and their\nbehavior\ncompetitive product and pricing information\nresults of your web “get, keep and grow” tests\ndetails of your customer acquisition costs and viral coefficient and the\nlatest stats on page views per visit, visit frequency, user growth, and\nretention optimization\nuser-testing results, showing the rate of improvement for activation,\nconversion, retention and growth activities\nThe team, often including investors, should review all the materials to\nensure that all the learning from discovery and validation has been integrated\ninto the latest versions of the hypothesis documents and into an updated\nversion of the business model canvas that will be discussed in the next step.\nThe key activity at this stage is to look at the intersections of, or interactions\namong, the business model components, since no doubt many components\nhave changed along the way. The process is a healthy one, and the results\nfuel the next steps of the pivot-or-proceed process.\nLook at the intersections of, or interactions among\nthe business model components.\nThe Business Model Checklist (Figure 11.2) gives you and your\nmanagement team the questions you should be asking and worrying about.\nPrint them out. Keep them handy. And worry “Am I going to bet my\ncompany that I got them right?”\nChecklist 41: Assemble Data\nGoal: Assemble all data, reports, questionnaires, map, diagrams, etc., for full\nreview\nReference: Chapter 11, Customer Validation, Phase 4: The Toughest\nQuestion of All: Pivot or Proceed?\nWorkflow map of the prototypical customer\nAn organizational/influence map\nCustomer archetypes\nFully updated business model diagram (plus a few prior versions)\nCustomer feedback from sales report cards\nMarket size and market share estimates\nChannel feedback and revenue potential summaries\nPricing, customer acquisition costs, and any major product cost changes\nDetailed information about the industry, customers and their behavior\nCompetitive product and pricing information\nExit criteria:\nAll key feedback, hard data, diagrams and the most recent business\nmodel canvas assembled for review\nLearning from Discovery and Validation incorporated into latest\nversions of the hypotheses documents and updated Business Model\nCanvas\nIntersections of/interactions among business model components\nreviewed\nPass/Fail tests identified\nPivot or Proceed: Validate Your Business Model\nIt’s been a long road but you’ve converted most of your business model\nhypotheses from customer discovery into facts. You’ve done so by extensive\ntesting through face-to-face customer interactions. So, if the customerrelationships hypothesis said one of every five acquired customers will\nactivate and pay for the service or app, this actually happened in validation,\nwith hundreds if not thousands of customers. Or you’ve proven that people\nreturn to the product or app three times a week for an average of 20 minutes\nper visit or spend $100 a month visiting once.\nReview Business Model Hypotheses (Figure 11.1)\nThe team should assemble data collected in the last phase in its “war\nroom” use the checklist to walk through the business model hypotheses, box\nby box, and ascertain that there are factual, definitive answers to at least\nevery question on the checklist.\nIn this final phase of customer validation the company asks itself the\nsame questions it asked in Phase 4 of customer discovery. But at this point, it\nshould have much more quantitative, irrefutable proof of the answers, since\nyou’ve spoken to far more customers and conducted many more tests.\nWeb/mobile startups have a unique set of business model hypotheses\nthat they need to validate, particularly in the “Get/Keep/Grow” Customer\nRelationships area. These questions include:\nHas the company proven it can acquire and activate a steadily-increasing\nnumber of customers at a cost in line with the cost structure?\nAre the customers being acquired demonstrating that they will spend\nand “stick” with the company at rates that will deliver the revenue plan?\nAnd are customers referring other good quality customers in sufficient\nnumbers to deliver these often-free new customers, reducing the average\nacquisition cost?\nIn multi-sided markets, are customers visiting often enough,\nparticipating actively enough, and staying active long enough to help the\ncompany generate the revenues it needs to succeed?\nThe Business Model Canvas as a Scorecard\nHopefully you’ve been taking regular snapshots of your business model\ncanvas – either week-by-week snapshots, or at least at each major pivot. If\nyou’ve done it this way you now essentially have a film strip of the\nentrepreneurial process.\nAs you can see from Figure 11.1, each stage of discovery and validation\nrefined the canvas. Experiments were run, learning caused iterations and a\nfew pivots, and all were documented in a new canvas (reread for tips).\nNow that you have your canvases up on the wall use them as a point of\ndiscussion.\nThe answers to “Is this a business?” can be found in\nthe results of the multitude of tests you’ve\nconducted throughout the validation process.\nThe answers to “Is this a business?” can be found in the results of the\nmultitude of tests you’ve conducted throughout the validation process. As is\noften the case, when the results aren’t convincing enough, or when they don’t\ndeliver the traffic or financial targets of the business model, it’s time to iterate\nor pivot, and retest to see if the new approach improves the results. After all,\nthe company will very shortly be spending millions of dollars in the customer\ncreation phase, where results are expected to be far more predictable, and\nmuch more is at risk. While this may seem ambitious and unreasonable, the\ncloser a company is to this “fact-based plan,” the greater its chances for\nbusiness and fund-raising success.\n\nBusiness Model Checklist (Figure 11.2)\nChecklist 42: Validate Business Model\nGoal: Use facts gathered to validate the business model\nReference: Chapter 11, Customer Validation, Phase 4: The Toughest\nQuestion of All: Pivot or Proceed?\nBusiness Model Checklist\nValue Proposition\nCustomer Segments\nValue Proposition 2: Market Type\nChannels\nCustomer Relationships\nCost Structure\nRevenue Stream\nExit criteria:\nEnsure all business model hypotheses have been converted into facts\nPass/Fail tests identified\nPivot or Proceed: Validate the Financial Model\nThis step answers one key question: do all the tests point to a scalable, sizable\nbusiness? And can it happen before the company runs out of money?\nIn this step, you’ll figure out whether you have a potentially thriving\nbusiness, a hobby, or a tax loss.\nAnswering the question doesn’t require pounds of Excel spreadsheets or\n50-item budgets. It relies more on the facts you’ve developed by testing your\noriginal hypotheses with the only people who have the answers, your\ncustomers, and with a short list of numbers, the metrics that matter.\nA mere handful of numbers define the difference\nbetween a scalable, profitable business and a\nfailure.\nA mere handful of numbers define the difference between a scalable,\nprofitable business and a failure. Successful entrepreneurs will be able to\nrecite, adjust, and recompute this handful or so of key numbers about\ncustomers, product costs, and revenue growth while they sleep. Meanwhile,\nthey’re always focused on the two metrics that matter most: how many\nmonths’ worth of cash remain in the bank? And how fast are we burning\nthrough what’s left?\nWe guarantee that this different approach to finance will get you thrown\nout of just about every business school in the country, but it’s all that’s\nneeded at this stage to determine whether your business model passes the\nvalidation test and is ready to move on from validation to scale in customer\ncreation.\nMetrics that Matter\nSince page 1 of this book you’ve been using the business model canvas to\norganize your testing. In this section we’re going to use the canvas to\norganize your financial model. This is a radically different approach\ncompared to more typical use of 5-year revenue forecast spreadsheets. Think\nof it as bringing your “report card” home to Mom and Dad—hopefully, a\nreport card full of A’s and A+’s, since B and C responses do not a great\ncompany make. Some elements of the business model represent revenue or\ncosts, while others fuel growth. Physical and web/mobile channel costs vary\nwidely, as do rates of sale and growth, so one last time we’ll examine the\nmetrics three different ways:\nIn a physical channel, less than a dozen numbers usually tell the entire story:\nValue proposition: What are product cost, market size, attainable market\nshare, and customer impact of network effects?\nCustomer Relationships: What are customer acquisition costs, prospect\nconversion rates, customer lifetime value, and customer switching costs\nthat the company may have to pay?\nMarket Type: As discussed in Chapter 1, different market types drive\ndifferent revenue curves to consider in longer-term revenue predictions\nCost Structure: What are the basic operating costs of the business?\nChannel: What are the costs of selling through the channel? Channel\nmargin, promotion, shelf-space charges?\nRevenue Streams: What are the average selling price, total achievable\nrevenue, and number of customers a year?\nBurn Rate (derived from the above): How much cash is the company\n“burning” (spending) a month? When will the company run out of cash?\nThere’s no precise formula for what a burn rate should be, but since it’s\nthe issue over which boards most often fire their founders, the founders\nand investors must agree on what the burn rate should be and how many\nmore pivots the startup can afford in its search for the scalable,\nprofitable business model\nIn the web/mobile channel, less than a dozen numbers tell the entire\nstory:\nValue proposition: What is the estimated per-user cost of a user, and are\nthere any incremental costs when one’s added. Estimate the market size,\nattainable market share, and the customer impact of referrals or network\neffects\nCustomer Relationships: What are customer acquisition costs, prospect\nconversion and retention rates, and how many new customers or users\nwill your current customers get you virally, for free?\nMarket Type: As discussed in Chapter 1, different market types drive\ndifferent revenue curves to consider in longer-term revenue predictions\nCost Structure: What are the basic operating costs of the business? (Be\nsure not to mingle or double-count these costs with your value\nproposition costs)\nChannel: What are the costs of selling through the channel: payments to\napp stores, marketplace sites like Amazon.com, or related sites referring\ncustomers to you?\nRevenue Streams: What are the average selling price, total achievable\nrevenue, and number of customers a year, and how long or how often\nwill customers spend?\nBurn Rate (derived from the above): How much cash is the company\n“burning” (spending) a month? When will the company run out of cash?\nA Few Words about Burn Rate\nVenture capitalist Fred Wilson suggests some burn-rate guidelines for\nventure funded web/mobile businesses that may be helpful to entrepreneurs\nof all stripes. Wilson’s advice looks at burn rate based on the company’s\ngrowth stage.\nCustomer discovery, which he calls the “building product” stage, should\nkeep the burn rate between $50,000 and $75,000 a month, which should\nfund a team of three or four engineers building the MVP as well as the\nfounding team, rent, operating costs and the like\nCustomer validation, Wilson’s “building usage” stage, shouldn’t exceed\na burn rate of $100,000 a month. This stage begins when product/market\nfit is achieved and fuels the “get customers” and MVP iteration\ndiscussed in this chapter\nCustomer creation, Wilson’s “building the business” stage, should\nideally hold the burn rate to $250,000 a month as the company builds a\nteam, expands marketing activities, and starts generating material\nrevenues\nThese are guidelines, and there are zillions of exceptions.\nAssemble all your test results to provide a forecast for the coming year,\nwhich begins on Day One of Step 3 of Customer Development, the customer\ncreation process.\nWe doubt there have been many startups where the year-one financial\nresults of customer creation matched the “metrics that matter.” But any VC,\nuncle or rich neighbor is going to want to know why you think an investment\nin your startup will deliver startup-size returns. If at the end of this step the\nnumbers are ugly—yup, you guessed it—turn back to the beginning of\ndiscovery, or at least customer validation, and start revising and retesting\nyour hypotheses.\nThree things to consider before you dive into Metrics That Matter:\nUse the time frames that make the most sense for your startup.\nGenerally, the longer the physical-channel sales cycle (think enterprise\nsoftware), the longer the “space” between calculations should be. Here\nwe used a quarter-by-quarter forecast\nAn analysis like this can—and should—often stop the pivot–or-proceed\nprocess in its tracks if the computation forecasts that the company will\neither run out of money within the year or won’t be able to raise enough\nfunds to survive the first year of customer creation\nDon’t be in a hurry at this critical step. As an entrepreneur, if you take a\npile of money to move forward here and fail, it will at least cost you a\nsignificant portion of your founders’ equity, and it will often cost you\nyour job\nMetrics that Matter Scenarios\nMetrics matters are a radically new approach to startup math. They’re best\nillustrated by example. The spreadsheet scenario on the following pages\nillustrates how you can use “Metrics that Matter” to evaluate your business if\nyou are selling a web/moile product in the web/mobile channel or in a\nmultisided web/mobile market.\nMetrics that Matter: Example 1\nExpense Reporter Sold via Web/mobile Channels\nLet’s take a look at Table 11.1, another $30 retail product, downloadable\nXpensePro software, sold through the web/mobile channels only.\n“Metrics That Matter”: Web/Mobile Sales Model (Table 11.1)\nNote: the leftmost numbers refer to commentary in descriptive text that\nfollows.\nIn this scenario, our hypothetical company is selling XpensePro only as\na web or mobile app download directly from its website and via app stores.\nAs in the previous example, things are factored into the numbers above:\nProduct-development cost is heavy at first and then declines.\nIncremental product unit costs are practically zero, since the product is a\ndownload\nRevenue never scales dramatically, since the market type is “resegmenting/niche market,” but the year-to-year revenue increases are\nsignificant enough to promise downstream success\nThis angel-funded business starts with $300,000 cash remaining. More\nmoney will be hard to get\nWhat Metrics Matter?\nThere are five metrics that matter in this spreadsheet:\n• Revenue comes from three channels\nDirect revenue from web sales, net of acquisition cost\nDirect mobile sales revenues, after subtracting referral incentives\nRevenue from the appstore channel, after subtracting channel fees\nand marketing costs\n• Cash burned or made during the period\n• Cash remaining at the end of the quarter\nBecause the business is operating in three distinct channels, each of\nwhich operates differently, it takes 17 different numbers to create the above\nfive metrics, but the board just needs to focus on five rather than 17. If one’s\never out of whack or way off budget, drill down into the supporting details\nnumbers that make that number up: unit sales, gross direct revenue, cost of\ncustomers or sales, and net revenue from the channel.\nFollowing the left-hand column of the spreadsheet, let’s explore the origin of\neach number and its source:\nWeb Sales:\n1. Direct web unit sales: How many web apps are downloaded from the\ncompany’s site. Customers are unlikely to make multiple purchases\nwithin a year.\n2. Gross direct revenue: Multiply the number of units (No. 1) by the\naverage selling price of $30.\n3. (Less) customer acquisition cost: The cost to make a sale over the web\nOn average, $6 worth of AdWords, incentives, e-mail and the like to\nacquire one customer. Multiply $6 by the number of solid units (No. 1).\n4. Net web revenue total: Subtract the customer acquisition cost (No. 3)\nfrom the gross direct revenue from website sales (No. 2).\n5. Direct mobile unit sales: A few customers will find and download the\napp’s mobile version at the company website (most will find it at the app\nstores). Calculate the quarterly units using the process described in EZ\nGardner metric #1.\nOn the surface, this looks like a really lovely\nbusiness.\n6. Gross revenue/direct mobile units: Multiply the number of mobile units\nsold directly to customers (No. 5) by $30, the average selling price.\n7. (Less) referral incentive: The customer-relationships hypothesis\nindicates that a third of the company’s direct sales will come from\nreferrals by happy customers encouraged by a $4 incentive. Take 1/3 of\nthe directsales web (No. 1) and mobile (No. 5) units and multiply by $4.\n8. DIRECT mobile revenue total: How much cash winds up in the\ncompany’s bank from this channel? Multiply units (No. 5) by\nrevenue/unit (No. 6) and then subtract the referral incentive (No. 7) to\nfind the answer.\n9. CHANNEL app-store sales (units): Calculate units using the channel\nmethod outlined in EZ Gardner unit sales #3.\n10. CHANNEL gross revenue: multiply the channel units sold (No. 9) by\nthe retail price of $30.\n11. (Less) market/app-store 30% fee: Every download sold will cost the\ncompany an app store fee of 30 percent, or $9. Multiply units (No. 9) by\n$9.00 and subtract it from channel revenue (No. 10).\n12. TOTAL NET APPSTORE revenue: Subtract the app-store fee (No.\n11) from channel revenue (No. 10) to find the amount of cash that will\nwind up in the company’s bank from app-store sales.\n13. TOTAL NET revenue (all channels): Add three revenue numbers—\nNo. 4 (direct web revenue), No. 8 (direct mobile revenue), and No. 12\n(net channel revenue)—to compute the company’s net sales.\n14. (Less) product/product-development costs: What does it cost to build\nand make the product? Compute your ongoing product development\ncosts, plus download and bandwidth charges. There’s no physical cost of\nthe product itself.\n15. (Less) current operating costs: Compute the costs of turning on the\nlights at the company every day, as in Example 1, line 9.\n16. CASH BURN FOR PERIOD: Did we make or lose money this quarter?\nHow much? Follow the process for calculating cash burn outlined in\nSpreadsheet 1, line 10.\n17. CASH REMAINING: Follow the process in Spreadsheet 1, No. 11.\nIf These Were Your Numbers, What’s a Founder to\nDo?\nOn the surface, this looks like a really lovely business. It plans to generate\n$746,000 in positive cash flow in its first year of customer creation, and to\nroughly triple that cashflow in its second year. But can a business doing $2.5-\nmillion in revenue after four years really make investors and founders happy?\nThat’s not for us to decide, and the numbers don’t tell us whether they spent\n$500,000 and a year—or $5,000,000 and five years—to get to the start of the\nspreadsheet, so it’s hard to applaud or bash the outcome.\nSeems like the next board meeting should pull out the latest business\nmodel canvas and look for some game-changing growth opportunities, almost\nno matter what. The company isn’t spending all that much money on product\ndevelopment or staff costs (those numbers are relatively flat), and it’s almost\nturning into a cash cow long before it should be turned out to pasture.\nAfter all, almost any business that can get almost 100,000 new\ncustomers in a year should be trying to figure out how to either add a zero to\nthat number in a year or two, or at least double it, perhaps, in the second year.\nThe company’s year two plan seems unambitious at first glance, even though\nthe profits double.\nMeanwhile, on the downside:\nThe $4 incentive (No. 7) might deliver too few sales and need to be\nbeefed up, changing net revenues adversely\nApp-store (No.12) approval process could delay launch in the biggest\nchannel, hurting revenues\nMore staff (No. 15) might be needed for support, channel relations, or\nwho-knows-what\nMobile sales direct to consumers (No. 5) could be a total flop, hurting\nthat revenue\nEven though the numbers look pretty good in the spreadsheet, hold the\nhigh-fives and look at ways to improve them anyway. After all, they’re still\nestimates based on customer validation proof—they’re not money in the bank\nby any means. Review the “what’s a founder to do” section under\nSpreadsheet 1 to explore ways to reduce the cash burn where it makes sense.\nHold all these thoughts—and others—for the final section of this phase, the\npivot-or-proceed discussion.\n\n“Metrics That Matter”: Multi-sided/Ad-Supported Model (Table 11.2)\nNote: the leftmost numbers refer to commentary in descriptive text that\nfollows.\nMetrics that Matter: Example 2\nA Multi-sided Market Example\nHere’s a third way to look at a totally different business model for the exact\nsame product, XPensePro software. Let’s explore a multi-sided market,\nwhere the product is identical but it’s absolutely free to users. Advertisers\neager to reach businesspeople with active expense accounts will pay to reach\nthe audience, and company revenues come from advertising and sales of email lists, the other “side” in this multi-sided market example.\nA multi-sided market, where the product is\nidentical but it’s absolutely free to users.\nIn this scenario, our venture-backed multi-sided market company is\noffering its products to users for free, provided that they agree to receive two\ne-mails per week from advertisers. The product is a digital download, but\nconsiderable resources are expended selling ads to the other side of the\nmarket. (It’s interesting to note how dissimilar these metrics that matter are\nwhen compared with the other two business models.) As in the previous\nexample, several things are factored into the numbers above:\nOur VC-backed example has a $10-million war chest\nProduct-development cost is heavy at first and then declines\nProduct costs are practically zero, since the “product” is a download.\nRevenue never scales dramatically, since the market type is “resegmenting/niche market,” but the year-to-year revenue increases are\nsignificant enough to promise downstream success\nMuch of the cost of advertising and e-mail sales is factored into the\nrevenue numbers, which are net of network or rep commission costs\nIt still costs real money to acquire users through PR, e-mail, and other\nactivities, even for a free product. As the company iterates and becomes\nsmarter, its acquisition cost declines in the second year\nMetrics that Matter/Add It All Up\nThere are 16 “metrics that matter” in this spreadsheet because we need to\nmonitor revenue and costs on both sides of the multi-sided market. (The\ncompany pivoted and eliminated cash sales of its product in this scenario.)\nFollowing the left-hand column of the spreadsheet, let’s explore the origin of\neach number as well as its source a little more closely:\n1. New activated users : How many people will download the free app and\nbegin actively using it. Active is defined as generating at least the average\nnumber of page views (No. 4).\n2. New user acquisition cost @ $3: On average, the customer acquisition\ncosts to generate one active user (No. 1). Some will come virally for free,\nothers will cost $6 or more.\n3. Total active users: Average active monthly users during the quarter.\n4. Average page views per user per quarter: Actual user clicks on the site\nwill generate this number by dividing the number of active users (No. 3)\ninto total page views (No. 5). This is an important measure of the\nbusiness health and growth.\n5. Total page views per quarter: Multiply the total users (No. 3) by the\naverage page views per user (No. 4) to begin to understand available\nadvertising-sales opportunities for the period.\n6. Less attrition: Lots of users abandon things they download but don’t\nhave to pay for, so watching this number (generated by instrumentation)\nis important. We’ve defined attrition as a user who hasn’t generated a\npage view a week for two consecutive months.\n7. TOTAL CPMs to sell: subtract attrition (No. 6) from total page views\n(No. 5) and divide by 1,000 for the “salable CPMs” needed (ad sales are\nbased on cost per thousand, or CPM). The +/- 7% average gets worse in\nyear two as more competitors emerge.\n8. Average CPM x 4 ads/page: Competitive analysis and “buy-side”\ncustomer validation research will determine what CPM advertisers are\nwilling to pay to reach this audience. Assuming four ads on each page,\nmultiply the average CPM by 4 to compute the average revenue per 1,000\npages viewed. In this example, we’ve already deducted the cost of sales,\nwhether it’s commissions for sales reps or network ad sales. The CPM\nincreases (Q3-4) as the site gets more attractive to advertisers.\n9. TOTAL ADVERTISING REVENUE: multiply the number of M’s (No.\n7) or total CPMs available for sale by the 4x average CPM (No. 8) to\ncompute advertising revenue. The figure grows dramatically as the\nnumber of users and their site traffic rise.\nThe business model looks so strong and\ncompelling...\n10. E-mail-list rental revenue: An estimate based on competitive analysis\nand buy-side customer validation research. This starts out small and at\nvery low rates (per thousand) and, both CPM and volume build as the\naudience becomes large enough to be attractive to advertisers.\n11. TOTAL REVENUE: This ad-supported multi-sided marketer has only\ntwo sources of revenue. Add the advertising revenue (No. 9) to the email-list rental revenue (No. 10).\n12. (Less) user acquisition cost: Subtract the number from Line 2 here.\n13. (Less) product/product-development cost: Computed from customer\nvalidation and cost structure boxes of the business model. While this\ndeclines later in the first year as the initial product matures, the budget\nincreases in the second year to add features that will help the company\ncontinue attracting new customers.\n14. (Less) current operating costs: Compute the costs of turning on the\nlights at the company every day, as the EZ Gardner example, line 9.\n15. CASH BURN per period: Subtract the three cost centers (Nos. 12, 13\nand 14) from the total revenue (No. 11) to compute the quarterly cash\nburn.\n16. Cash remaining/end of quarter: Subtract the cash burned (or collected)\nduring the quarter from the checkbook balance as of the first day of the\nquarter to calculate the cash remaining at quarter’s end. This number\nbecomes attractive rather quickly in this model.\nIf These Were Your Numbers, What’s a founder to\ndo?\nThere’s an old rule in startups that a spreadsheet is worth 48.5x the paper it’s\nprinted on. But if this spreadsheet set of “metrics that matter,” is anywhere\nclose to accurate, our founders and investors at Expensereporter may indeed\nhave a homerun on their hands.\nIn this case, the business model looks so strong and compelling that the\nfounders have two clear priorities. Job #1 is to play strong defense, and make\ncertain that they deliver on all the key numbers in the plan (which, as you\nrecall, are already turned into immutable facts through two grueling stages of\nCustomer Development). That process starts with a step-by-step revalidation\nof every single number on the page, to be sure there are no mistakes. Next\nstep: a detailed “worst case” analysis.\nAs every business should, the founding team here should expand this\none set of metrics into three: a worst case and a high case, on both sides of\nthe hypothetical set of metrics shown here. And since the business is totally\ndependent on advertising revenue, they should quickly return to their channel\nvalidation efforts and probe further to make sure they’re as valid as everyone\nbelieves. They should also focus on reducing user attrition.\nWith all that accomplished, review the analyses from Spreadsheets 1 and\n2 about reducing costs and optimizing activation and revenue. Then, just in\ncase, put a case of great French Champagne in the office fridge!\nSome Final Thoughts About the Financial Model\nMarket Type Affects Revenue Streams. Each of the four market types has a\ndistinctive sales-growth curve shaped by the degree of difficulty involved in\ntransitioning from sales to the earlyvangelists to sales to mainstream\ncustomers. Obviously in new markets, it typically takes considerable time for\nthe product to catch on beyond earlyvangelists, who aren’t typically high-\nvolume mainstream buyers. So success with early sales doesn’t guarantee fast\nrevenue scaling.\nThe sales-growth curves for a new market and an existing market\ngraphically illustrate the difference. Even after finding and successfully\nselling to earlyvangelists, the rate of sales differs in later years because of the\ndifferent adoption rates of mainstream customers.\nRevenue Growth in New and Existing Markets (Figure 11.3)\nEstimating revenue in an existing market is relatively simple: Look at\nthe incumbents and calculate the increasing percentage of market share the\nstartup will grab each year.\nEstimating a new market’s size might seem impossible, since it doesn’t\nexist yet. What to do? Estimate the opportunity based on proxies and adjacent\nmarkets. See if there are any comparable companies. Have others grown as\nfast as the estimate? Why will this startup perform similarly?\nRevenue Growth in a Resegmented Market (Figure 11.4)\nThe sales curve in a re-segmented market is somewhat easier to\nestimate. It’s generally similar to that of a new market in that it takes time to\ngather a head of steam. There are three steps to assessing a re-segmented\nmarket: assess the size of the existing market, figure out how large your\nstartup’s “segment” is, and calculate the adoption rate, or the time it will take\nfor that segment to recognize the new product as the solution of choice.\nCount only the segment that will switch, and beware of long-term contracts,\nservice contracts, and “sunk costs” such as training and installation, all of\nwhich are often “lock-ins” or hidden barriers to switching.\nRevenue growth curves depend on Market Type!\nDemand Curve Affects Revenue: The “demand curve” seeks the optimum\nintersection between sales volume and net profit. For example, if a physical\nproduct is most efficiently manufactured in lot sizes of 5,000, can that\ninventory be sold in a reasonable time when current unit sales are 50 a\nmonth? A startup selling new electric cars for $29,000 will generate massive\ndemand. But if they cost $45,000 to manufacture, the company will go\nbankrupt very quickly. Consider:\nthe actual price per unit, for multiples, and for subscriptions\nhow pricing can be used to attract more users\nhow pricing can create larger or more frequent purchases by the same\nuser; volume discounts, free shipping, loyalty points and similar pricing\nmechanisms are used for what’s typically called “market basket”\noptimization\nhow pricing can be used to enhance profitability or volume\nhow the company can forward-price the product to intersect the\neconomies-of-scale curve (as in, “If we could build 10,000 at a time, our\nproduction cost drops 32 percent”)\nWhen to Bring in the Accountants\nEventually, prospective investors, banks, and others will want to see the\ntraditional P&L, forecast, and more, and that’s fine. Once the metrics that\nmatter are firmly understood to make sound business sense and are validated,\nalmost any finance type (or high school math student) can convert them into a\nVC-ready multiyear P&L spreadsheet, balance sheet, and cash-flow statement\n(the “usual stuff” everyone is accustomed to seeing) with ease.\nOn rare and welcome occasions, metrics that matter actually don’t\nmatter at all. If customer acquisition and activation are proceeding at warp\nspeed month after month or the economy is hot, investors may ignore most of\nthe other metrics, throw caution to the wind, and vote to scale the company\nrapidly. This seldom happens, but we hope it happens to you. It can happen\nmore often in frothy vertical markets, as it did in social networking and other\nmulti-sided markets or strong IPO markets,. But nine times out of 10, the\nmetrics that matter do matter quite a bit when it comes time to spend serious\ninvestor dollars.\nAdding it all up\nThis phase is a vital make-or-break analysis of how well the business model\nshould work. But remember that the numbers are still only educated guesses,\nvalidated—we hope—through extensive customer discovery and validation\neffort with scores if not hundreds of customers.\nChecklist 43: Validate Financial Model\nGoal: Ensure the startup can become a profitable, scalable business before it\nruns out of money\nReference: Chapter 11, Customer Validation, Phase 4: The Toughest\nQuestion of All: Pivot or Proceed?\nValue Proposition\nProduct cost\nMarket size\nAttainable market share\nCustomer impact of network effects\nCustomer Relationships\nCustomer acquisition costs\nProspect conversion rates\nCustomer Lifetime Value\nCustomer switching costs\nMarket Type considerations\nBasic operating costs\nChannel costs\nChannel margin, promotion and shelf space fees\nRevenue streams\nAverage selling price\nTotal achievable revenue\nNumber of customers/year\nCash balance\nDo the Math\nExit criteria:\nA full financial picture of the company’s ability to succeed\nPass/Fail tests identified\nPivot or Proceed: Re-Validate the Business Model\nIt’s the perfect time to take one last look at the key business model\ncomponents, for several reasons. In a few days, a great deal will change if the\nvote is “go forward” to the customer creation step. Customer creation is a\nradically different stage during which the company suddenly shifts from\n“searching for a business model” to “executing one.” It’s no longer\ncelebrating mistakes and wrong turns. It shifts full-throttle into “execute”\nmode, with revenue targets and timetables to hit, product and plans to deliver,\nand more granular and precise accountability to investors and board\nmembers.\nThe company is about to spend a great deal of money far faster, and\nirrevocably, as it works ambitiously to deliver its chosen business model.\nWith that comes the typical “career risk” for founders, which always prompts\ninvestors to ask if the seemingly manic “founder type” should be replaced by\na “seasoned” leader with proven execution skills. Massive amounts of money\nare about to be spent on a single, focused bet that the business model, as\ndeveloped, has a high likelihood of scaling to profit and success. Boards and\ninvestors are suddenly less forgiving and typically far less welcoming of\nreports like “That idea was wrong” and “That didn’t work as we hoped” than\nthey were during the earlier “search” phases.\nLong story short, it’s time to revisit the core business model elements\none last time.\nBest Bets\nYou’re almost done. You’ve run the numbers in the last section and are still\nfeeling like your business is a winner. But have you picked the best value\nproposition? Is your product delivery schedule right? Are you confident\nyou’ve gotten the optimum revenue model and costs? And have you missed\nany best moves on the overall business model? Here are a few last things to\ncheck.\nMake Sure the Value Proposition is Right\nAfter going through the “metrics that matter” in the last section, are you\nabsolutely convinced you have the right value proposition? You’re about to\nlive with it for awhile. If you don’t feel that it’s going to win the marketplace\nnow, it doesn’t get better over time. It may be time to reconfigure, repackage\nor unbundle the product. This requires a loop all the way back to customer\ndiscovery. Once there, use the core technology to develop another product,\nconfiguration, distribution method or price and then modify product\npresentations and return to Phase 3 (product presentation) and do it again.\nYes, it hurts, but it hurts far less than failure.\nMake Sure the Product Delivery is Right\nEven with selling success, check the product delivery timing with the\nproduct-development team. Schedules inevitably change, seldom for the\nbetter. Can the company still deliver what was just sold and do so as\npromised, or was the sale actually vaporware? If vaporware, at best the\ncompany secured a few pilot projects. Continuing to sell as if nothing has\nchanged is a bad idea. As schedules slip, hard-won earlyvangelists weaken,\nand references evaporate quickly. The good news is, if this happens (it\nhappens often), the situation is still recoverable. There aren’t many people to\nfire, and the burn rate is low. (As discussed earlier, it’s always important to\nhave enough cash to get this phase wrong at least once.) The solution is to\nshut down any additional selling for a while, admit mistakes, and turn pilot\nprojects into something useful—first for the customer and then as a\nmarketable product.\nMake Sure the Revenue is High and Costs are Low\nThere’s nothing worse than leaving money on the table or spending more\nthan you needed to. The best way to answer these questions and more is to\n“walk” slowly through the business model one more time.\nStart with the value proposition. Are there too many features or not\nenough variety? Would a lower price sell far more units or sell the same\nnumber at a lower acquisition cost? What if the product were free, or\nfree to those bringing three or five or 10 other customers along?\nIn the customer-relationships hypothesis, is there rock-solid confidence\nin the plan, or might a freemium or multi-sided alternative deliver\nbolder, faster growth? Will that costly AdWords effort deliver the\nplanned result?\nCan a different channel deliver fewer sales and more profit?\nWill partners deliver the revenue growth you need and expect?\nAre there higher level business model patterns you may have missed?\nMake Sure Your Business Model is Right\nGrab a fresh business model canvas and a pack of Post-it notes. Explore\nalternatives seriously. The team is about to put a big pile of chips, probably\nmillions, on “red” or “black,” as in “pass” or “fail.” Is everyone confident the\nchoice is the right?\nChanging direction at this juncture is a bold move indeed. It’s not what\nthe investors expected, especially after a long, grueling process of customer\ndiscovery and validation. Then again, bold moves are the work of great\nentrepreneurs. And even though a pivot at this point leads to more customer\nvalidation and more time, it’s far better to pivot now than to forge ahead at\nfull speed and full spend if it’s possible that there’s a better idea out there\nsomewhere.\nFurther validate the business model, not just looking for enhancements\nin revenue opportunity and places to reduce cost, but looking for “game\nchangers.” Can you change a product sold by features into a brandedexperience that becomes a “got-to-have-it” fashion? Can you change a\nrevenue model from a unit sale into a network effects model? Look for the\nnon-obvious business patterns. Even if the team is certain the current model\nis the best way forward, now’s the time to bring in your advisory board and\nhave them throw stones (painful as it is) at your canvas. Do they see a huge\nmove that you missed? No doubt the financial model review just completed\nraised at least a handful of questions and perhaps pointed to some\nopportunities. Revisit the business model checklist questions. Are any of the\nanswers different? Does the team want to have more money in the bank or\nspend less? Where can savings be effected or additional dollars efficiently put\nto good?\nIf the team has turned over every possibility in its review, looking both\nat radical changes and modest improvements in the business model, and\nconfidence still carries the day, it’s time to move on to the ultimate question:\npivot or proceed?\nChecklist 44: Re-Validate The Business Model\nGoal: Further validate the business model\nReference: Chapter 11, Customer Validation, Phase 4: The Toughest\nQuestion of All: Pivot or Proceed? Revalidate the Financial Model\nBusiness Model Canvas revisited\nBusiness Model Checklist revisited\nValue Proposition\nCustomer Segments\nValue Proposition 2: Market Type\nChannels\nCustomer Relationships\nCost Structure\nRevenue Stream\nExit criteria:\nDetermine if the company is making the best bet possible\nAssess if revenue is as high and costs as low as they can realistically be\nPass/Fail tests identified\nThe Toughest Startup Question: Pivot or Proceed?\nThis is the moment of truth when the team and the investors will vote on\nwhether to begin spending massive amounts of money to execute the business\nmodel. To vote honestly, the team needs to take a hard, honest look at the\npivot-or-proceed analyses developed in this phase.\nAs grueling as the customer validation process is, it’s quite likely that\nthe company will require another turn of the wheel before everyone can\nenthusiastically vote to move forward. Don’t despair—this need to pivot\narises almost every time, and often calls for a return all the way to customer\ndiscovery.\nHubris is the evil twin of a passionate entrepreneur.\nThe alternative is even more painful. In the past, investors magically\nassumed flawless execution and fired executives who failed. It’s time to\nreflect, thinking seriously about the company’s genuine chances for scalable,\nprofitable success. It’s a hard decision, particularly for self-confident\nentrepreneurs who pride themselves on their tenacity, and problem-solving\nabilities. “I’m an entrepreneur. I make things happen against all odds” just\ndoesn’t cut it when staring at the hard facts and statistics. Don’t confuse\nhubris with passion or facts.\nDid validation really convert opinions to facts, or is everyone just\nmoving the goalposts to reach customer creation? The next step seriously\ncranks up the company’s cash burn rate, sharply diminishing if not\nextinguishing available cash or runway.\nDid the product sell well and easily? Is it absolutely, unequivocally clear\nthat when more money is spent to acquire customers, they’ll arrive at a\nsteady, predictable, profitable pace? This question in particular probably\nsends 90 percent of startups back into the depths of Customer Development\nto refine and retest components of the business model.\nIf the “ramp” to more customers, revenue and profits isn’t proved to be\npredictable in test results, it’s also a reason to pivot. Using everything you\nlearned in customer validation, go back to Phase 1 of this step (get ready to\nsell) and try it again. Sorry. This isn’t easy to do.\nIf everything checks out (again, it seldom does the first time around), the\nend of customer validation is a major milestone. Customer problems are\nunderstood, a set of earlyvangelists has been found, and the company has\ndelivered a product its customers want to buy, developed a repeatable and\nscalable sales process, and demonstrated a profitable business model.\nHopefully, all the learning is captured in writing and the business model\ndiagram is updated. Fund-raising, while never easy, will be far easier than at\nthis point than it was before.\nWhen you’ve answered “yes” to that taxing list of questions, you\ndeserve a night off, if not a week. Congratulations! The company is prepared\nto move full speed ahead to the customer creation process.\nWhat’s Next?\nThe first two steps of Customer Development are where entrepreneurs live or\ndie in the search for a repeatable and scalable business model. When a\ncompany has successfully exited Customer Validation, there’s a library full\nof business-building texts available to help execute the business model. So, at\nleast for now, if you’re eager to execute the next two steps—Customer\nCreation and Company Building—return to the original Four Steps to the\nEpiphany, or turn to a more targeted text for fine-tuned support.\nWhatever you do next, the successful completion of Customer\nValidation is a momentous step in the life of your startup. You have\ncompleted an arduous, challenging journey. Our warmest, most sincere\ncongratulations. We look forward to learning about your success!\nChecklist 45: Pivot or Proceed?\nGoal: Decide whether to execute the business model\nReference: Chapter 11, Customer Validation, Phase 4: The Toughest\nQuestion of All: Pivot or Proceed?\nDid the Validation effort really convert opinions to facts?\nBusiness model diagram is updated\nDid the product sell well and easily?\nIs it clear that customers will continue to arrive at a steady, predictable,\nprofitable pace?\nRepeatable and scalable sales process developed\nProduct delivery timing checked\nConfirmation that company can deliver on what was sold, do as\npromised\nProfitable business model demonstrated\nMove forward or pivot?\nExit criteria:\nAn informed decision about whether to move forward\nPass/Fail tests identified\nHow To Build a Web Startup –\nLean LaunchPad Edition\nIf you’re an experienced coder and user interface designer you think nothing\nis easier than diving into Ruby on Rails, Node.js and Balsamiq and throwing\ntogether a website. (Heck, in Silicon Valley even the waiters can do it.)\nBut for the rest of us mortals whose eyes glaze over at the buzzwords,\nthe questions are, “How do I get my great idea on the web? What are the\nsteps in building a website?” And the most important question is, “How do I\nuse the business model canvas and Customer Development to test whether\nthis is a real business?”\nMy first attempt at helping students answer these questions was by\nputting together the Startup Tools Page at www.steveblank.com. It’s a\ncompilation of available tools for startups. While it was a handy reference, it\nstill didn’t help the novice.\nSo below, I offer my next attempt.\nHow To Build a Web Startup – The Lean LaunchPad Edition\nHere’s the step-by-step process we suggest our students use in our Lean\nLaunchPad classes. All these steps are covered in Chapters 3,4 and 5.\n1. Set up the logistics to manage your team\n2. Craft company hypotheses\n3. Write a value proposition statement that other people understand\n4. Set up the Website Logistics\n5. Build a “low fidelity” web site\n6. Get customers to the site\n7. Add the backend code to make the site work\n8. Test the “problem” with customer data\n9. Test the “solution” by building the “high-fidelity” website\n10. Ask for money\n(Use the Startup Tools page at www.steveblank.com as a resource for\ntool choices.)\nThe tools listed in these Steps are examples. They are not recommended\nor preferred, just representative of what’s available. New tools appear\ndaily. Do your homework. See www.steveblank.com for a list of the\nlatest tools.\nStep 1: Set Up Team Logistics\nRead Chapter 1 - The Customer Development Manifesto\nSet up a WordPress blog to document your Customer Development\nprogress\nUse Skype or Google+ Hangouts for team conversations\nStep 2. Craft Your Company Hypotheses\nWrite down your 9-business model canvas hypothesis\nList key features/Minimal Viable product plan\nSize the market opportunity. Use Google Trends, Google Insights, and\nFacebook ads to evaluate the market growth potential. Use Crunchbase\nto look at competitors\nCalculate Total Available Market, and customer value\nPick market type (existing, new, resegmented)\nPrepare weekly progress summary: business model canvas update +\nweekly Customer Development summary (described after Step 10)\nStep 3: Write a Unique Selling Proposition statement that other people\nunderstand\nIf you can’t easily explain why you exist, none of the subsequent steps\nmatter. A good format is “We help X do Y by doing Z”\nOnce you have a statement in that format, find a few other people\n(doesn’t matter if they’re your target market) and ask them if it makes\nsense\nIf not, give them a longer explanation and ask them to summarize that\nback to you. Other people are often better than you at crafting an\nunderstandable Unique Selling Proposition.\nStep 4: Website Logistics\nGet a domain name for your company. To find an available domain\nquickly, try Domize or Domainr\nThen use godaddy or namecheap to register the name. (You may want to\nregister many different domains (different possible brand names, or\ndifferent misspellings and variations of a brand name)\nOnce you have a domain, set up Google Apps on that domain (for free!)\nto host your company name, email, calendar, etc.\nFor coders: set up a web host\nUse virtual private servers (VPS) like Slicehost or Linode (cheapest\nplans ~$20/month, and you can run multiple apps and websites)\nYou can install Apache or Nginx with virtual hosting, and run several\nsites plus other various tools of your choice (assuming you have the\ntechnical skills of course) like a MySQL database\nIf you are actually coding a real app, use a “Platform As A Service”\n(PAAS) like Heroku, DotCloud or Amazon Web Services if your app\ndevelopment stack fits their offerings\nCustomer Discovery for the Web\nStep 5: Build a Low Fidelity Web Site\nDepending on your product, this may be as simple as a splash page with:\nyour value proposition, benefits summary, and a call-to-action to learn\nmore, answer a short survey, or pre-order)\nFor surveys and pre-order forms, Wufoo and Google Forms can easily\nbe embedded within your site with minimal coding\nFor non-coders:\nMake a quick prototype in PowerPoint, or\nUse Unbounce, Google Sites, Weebly, Godaddy, WordPress or Yola\nFor surveys and pre-order forms, Wufoo and Google Forms can easily\nbe embedded within your site with minimal coding\nFor coders: build the User Interface\nPick a website wireframe prototyping tool, (i.e. JustinMind, Balsamiq)\n99 Designs is great to get “good enough” graphic design and web design\nwork for very cheap using a contest format. Themeforest has great\ndesigns\nCreate wireframes and simulate your “Low Fidelity” website\nCreate a fake sign up/order form to test customer commitment.\nAlternatively, create a “viral” landing page, with LaunchRock or\nKickoffLabs\nEmbed a slideshow on your site with Slideshare or embed a video/tour\nusing Youtube or Vimeo\nDo user interface testing with Usertesting or Userfy\nStep 6: Customer Engagement (drive traffic to your preliminary website)\nStart showing the site to potential customers, testing customer segment\nand value proposition\nUse Ads, textlinks or Google AdWords, Facebook ads and natural\nsearch to drive people to your Minimally Viable web site\nUse your network to find target customers – ask your contacts, “Do you\nknow someone with problem X? If so, can you forward this message on\nto them?” and provide a 2-3 sentence description\nFor B2B products, Twitter, Quora, and industry mailing lists are a good\nplace to find target customers.

For your initial\nsite, Google Analytics provides adequate information with the fastest\nsetup. Once you’ve moved beyond your initial MVP, you’ll want to\nconsider a more advanced analytic platform (Kissmetrics, Mixpanel,\nKontagent, etc.)\nCreate an account to measure user satisfaction (GetSatisfaction,\nUserVoice, etc.) from your product and get feedback and suggestions on\nnew features\nSpecific questions, such as “Is there anything preventing you from\nsigning up?” or “What else would you need to know to consider this\nsolution?” tend to yield richer customer feedback than generic feedback\nrequests\nIf possible, collect email addresses so that you have a way to contact\nindividuals for more in-depth conversations\nStep 9: Test the “Customer Solution” by building a full featured High\nFidelity version of your website\nUpdate the website with information learned in Steps 5-8\nRemember that “High Fidelity” still does not mean “complete product.”\nYou need to look professional and credible, while building the smallest\npossible product in order to continue to validate\nKeep collecting customer analytics\nHearing “This is great, but when are you going to add X?” is your goal!\nStep 10: Ask for money\nPut a “pre-order” form in place (collecting billing information) even\nbefore you’re ready to collect money or have a full product\nWhen you’re ready to start charging – which is probably earlier than you\nthink – find a billing provider such as Recurly, Chargify, or PayPal to\ncollect fees and subscriptions\nFor all Steps:\nGive your team a weekly Lessons Learned progress report.\n• Start by putting up your business model canvas\n• Changes from the prior week should be highlighted in red\n• Lessons Learned.

of All: Pivot or Proceed?\nThe Startup Owner’s Manual for Physical Channel Startups Index\nHow to Read This Book\nCLEARLY, THE STARTUP OWNER’S MANUAL IS not a novel. This book is a stepby-step how-to guide that details a process for building a successful,\nprofitable, scalable startup. It has more in common with a car repair manual\nthan it does with your favorite page-turner. Don’t attempt to read this book in\na single sitting or long weekend. It will be your companion—and, we hope,\nyour very best friend—for the six to 30 months or more that it often takes to\nbegin building a successful, scalable startup business.\nOrganization\nThis book is organized in four distinct sections. The first, Getting Started,\ndescribes the Customer Development methodology and ends with the\n“Customer Development Manifesto,” a series of 14 guiding principles for\nstartups deploying the Customer Development process.\nDon’t read too much at a time.\nThe next section, Step One, “Customer Discovery,” turns the founders’\nvision into a business model canvas and then into a series of hypotheses.\nThose hypotheses are turned into experiments, and tested with customers to\nsee if your understanding of the customer problem and proposed solution\nmesh.\nStep Two, “Customer Validation,” expands the scope of the business\nmodel testing to see if you can get enough orders or users to prove that you\nhave a repeatable and scalable business model.\nInterspersed throughout is a series of Checklists that help you track your\nprogress at every stage of the Customer Development process. Use the\nchecklists at the end of each step (yes, there’s one for each) to make sure you\nhave completed all the key tasks outlined in that step. Download them, share\nthem and circulate them to team members. But most important, use them to\nbe sure you have completed each step—before you move on to the next.\nPaths Through This Book\n• Read the glossary first. Customer Development has a language all its\nown.\n• Before you dive into the details, read the Customer Development\nManifesto.\n• If you are familiar with Customer Development, start with Chapter 3,\n“the business model hypotheses.”\n• If you want to align co-founders, initial employees, investors and\nadvisors around the Customer Development philosophy, have them\nread The Startup Owner’s Manual Strategy Edition.\n• If you want a high-speed overview and little more, there are two\napproaches:\n(a) skim the checklists at the end of each step, which will give you a\nsense of all the tasks you must complete to implement Customer\nDevelopment; or\n(b) flip through the book, looking for “jumbo quotes” like this:\nThis book is not a novel... It’s a reference manual.\nThese quotes highlight the 100 or so “big ideas” found throughout the\nbook and offer a “CliffsNotes” or “Twitter” sense of the text.\n• If you want a detailed checklist of the things founders need to get right,\nstart with Chapter 3, “the business model hypothesis,” and use the\nchecklists at the end of each step.\n• If your startup is well under way, you might want to start at Chapter 6,\n“Pivot or Proceed,” to gauge your progress. Then you can jump to\nChapter 11, “Metrics that Matter,” to see if you’re ready to scale.\n• To develop and test a physical minimum viable product (MVP), read:\nCustomer Contacts, Problem Understanding, Customer\nUnderstanding, and The Sales Roadmap.\n• To focus on physical channel sales and marketing (how to “get”,\n“keep” and “grow” customers), read:\nHypotheses: Customer Segments Who/Problem, Channels,\nCustomer Relationships, and Revenue Stream Pricing.\nPrepare for Customer Contacts, Problem Understanding, Market\nKnowledge, Create Product Presentation, and Test Solution with\nCustomer.\nGet Out of the Building: Create Sales and Collateral Materials, Hire\nSales Closer, Sales Channel Roadmap, and Develop the Sales\nRoadmap.\n• Educators who want to teach Customer Development or the experiential\nLean LaunchPad class should read:\nOur website, www.steveblank.com, with links to our syllabi used at\nStanford, Berkeley and the National Science Foundation.\nBefore the class meets, have the students read:\n— The Customer Development Manifesto in Chapter 1\n— An Introduction to Customer Discovery in Chapter 1\nEach week’s lectures are organized around each of the individual\nhypotheses in Phase 1.\nFor the Lean LaunchPad class, have students read:\n— Get Out of the Building and Test the Problem in Chapter 4.\n— Get Out of the Building and Test the Product Solution in\nChapter 5.\nAll classes should read:\n— Pivot or Proceed, in Chapter 6.\n— Metrics that Matter, in Chapter 11.\nA Few Helpful Tips\nUse the checklists. There is one for every step.\nDon’t read too much at a time. This is a reference manual. It’s\nexhausting when read as a book. Take “small bites” of a few sections at a\ntime, at most.\nScan ahead. It gives you context for what you are currently doing. If\nyou’re starting work on Chapter 3, for example, quickly scan Chapter 4 first\nso you understand how what you’re doing now supports what comes next.\nFor a helpful online tool to monitor your team’s progress in the\nCustomer Development process, visit\nhttp://www.zoomstra.com/foundersworkbook.\nEntrepreneurship is not a cookbook or a checklist. At the end of the day,\nfounders are artists. Don’t expect everything to work like the book. It’s\nimpossible for this book to address every entrepreneurial decision and every\ntype of startup. You’re outside the building not only looking for facts, but for\ninsight and inspiration. Not every piece of advice fits every situation you’ll\nencounter. And not every piece of advice will always work. That’s what\nentrepreneurs are for.\nCHAPTER 1\nThe Customer Development Manifesto\nBEFORE DIVING HEADFIRST INTO THE DETAILS of the Customer Development\nprocess, it’s crucial to review the 14 rules that make up The Customer\nDevelopment Manifesto. Embrace them. Review them regularly with the team\nand (maybe after the IPO) consider perhaps even etching them in marble at\nworld headquarters.\nRule No. 1:\nThere Are No Facts Inside Your Building, So Get\nOutside.\nOn Day One, the startup is a faith-based enterprise built on its founders’\nvision and a notable absence of facts. The founders’ job is to translate this\nvision and these hypotheses into facts. Facts live outside the building, where\nfuture customers (prospects, really) live and work, so that’s where you need\nto go. Nothing is more fundamental to Customer Development, and nothing\nis harder to do. It’s much easier to write code, build hardware, have meetings\nand write reports than it is to find and listen to potential customers. But that’s\nwhat separates the winners from the losers.\nFacts live outside the building, where future\ncustomers live and work...\nIn Customer Development, the founders gather firsthand experience\nabout every component of the business model. The team can support the\nfounders, but firsthand experience by definition cannot be delegated. This\ncustomer research must be done by founders because:\nKey customer feedback points are random, unpredictable, and often\npainful to hear. Employees hate to deliver bad news to higher-ups\nEmployees have far less at stake and seldom listen as acutely, and they\ndon’t get heard adequately when they report back. It’s too easy to\ndismiss their findings as “hearsay” or to ignore critical points of\nfeedback\nConsultants have even less at stake than employees and often color their\ncommentary to either tell the client what he wants to hear or deliver\nmessages that can lead to extended consulting relationships. This is also\nsecond- or third-hand feedback and too diluted or diffused to provide\nvalue\nOnly a founder can embrace the feedback, react to it, and adeptly make\nthe decisions necessary to change or pivot key business model components.\nRule No. 2:\nPair Customer Development with Agile\nDevelopment\nCustomer Development is useless unless the product\ndevelopment organization can iterate the product\nwith speed and agility.\nCustomer Development is useless unless the product development\norganization can iterate the product with speed and agility. If Engineering\nbuilds the product using waterfall development, it will be deaf, dumb and\nblind to customer input except during a short period when it’s specifying the\nproduct. The rest of the time, engineers are locked into an implementation\ncycle, unable to change the product features without intolerable delay. By\ncontrast, a startup engineering organization using an agile methodology is\ndesigned to continually take customer input and deliver a product that iterates\nreadily around an MVP or its minimum feature set.\nIn this book, agile engineering/development refers to the rapid\ndeployment, iterative development and continuous discovery processes that\nhardware or software companies can use. We don’t advocate any particular\nflavor, just its necessity. The Customer Development process provides the\ncontinuous customer input to make agile work.\nBefore the company even starts, the founders need to reach a deep and\ninexorable commitment to the customer/agile development partnership.\nRule No. 3:\nFailure is an Integral Part of the Search\nOne of the key differences between a startup and an existing company is the\none that’s never explicitly stated: “startups go from failure to failure.”\nIn contrast, existing companies have learned what works and doesn’t.\nFailures in an existing company are an exception. They happen when\nsomeone screws up. In a startup, you’re searching, not executing, and the\nonly way to find the right path is to try lots of experiments and take a lot of\nwrong turns. Failure is part of the process.\nIf you’re afraid to fail in a startup, you’re destined\nto do so.\nFailures are not truly failures, per se but an integral part of the startup\nlearning process. You’ll be running dozens if not hundreds of pass/fail tests\n—on your pitch, your features, your pricing, and on and on—so get ready to\naccept failure and move on. When something isn’t working, successful\nfounders orient themselves to the new facts, decide what needs fixing, and act\ndecisively.\nThe Customer Development process demands frequent, agile iteration,\nfollowed, of course, by testing of the iteration that often leads to another\niteration or pivot, which leads to more testing and...\nIf you’re afraid to fail in a startup, you’re destined to do so.\nRule No. 4:\nMake Continuous Iterations and Pivots\nThe strategy of embracing failure in Customer Development demands\nfrequent, agile iteration and pivots. A pivot is a substantive change in one or\nmore of the nine boxes of the business model canvas. (For example, a pricing\nchange from freemium to subscription model or a customer segment shift\nfrom boys 12-15 years old to women 45-60.) Or it can be more complex,\nsuch as a change of target customer or user. Iterations, meanwhile, are minor\nchanges to business model components (e.g., changing pricing from $99 to\n$79).\nGroupon’s legendary $12 billion pivot is a perfect\nexample.\nWhen a company is limping along, only a dramatic change to one or\nmore business model components can get it back on the road to success.\nGroupon’s legendary $12 billion pivot (their IPO valuation) is a perfect\nexample. Groupon was started from a company called the Point. It was\nstruggling, at best, as a social media platform working to get people together\nto solve problems, but was about to run out of money.\nThe most effective campaigns on The Point were those that saved people\nmoney by grouping or bundling their purchases. The founders started\nblogging various deals from different businesses each day. They called this,\n“Get Your Groupon.com.” Groupon’s first offer hit in October of 2008: buy\ntwo pizzas for the price of one in the shop on the first floor of its Chicago\nheadquarters. Twenty people bought the deal and the company was well on\nits way to its $12-billion pivot.\nPivots are driven by the learnings and insight from a continuous stream\nof “pass/fail” tests you run throughout discovery and validation.\nThe best startup founders don’t hesitate to make the change. They admit\nwhen hypotheses are wrong and adapt.\nRule No. 5:\nNo Business Plan Survives First Contact with\nCustomers So Use a Business Model Canvas\nThere’s only one reason for a business plan: some investor who went to\nbusiness school doesn’t know any better and wants to see one. But once it has\ndelivered financing, the business plan is fundamentally useless.\nEntrepreneurs often mistake their business plan as a cookbook for execution,\nfailing to recognize that it is only a collection of unproven assumptions. At its\nback, a revenue plan blessed by an investor, and composed overwhelmingly\nof guesses, suddenly becomes an operating plan driving hiring, firing, and\nspending. Insanity.\nThe difference between a static business plan and a\ndynamic model could well be the difference between\nflameout and success.\nThe difference between a static business plan and a dynamic business\nmodel could well be the difference between a flameout and success. Startups\nshould dump the business plan and adopt the flexible business model.\nA business model describes the flow between key components of the\ncompany:\nvalue proposition, which the company offers (product/service, benefits)\ncustomer segments, such as users, and payers, or moms or teens\ndistribution channels to reach customers and offer them the value\nproposition\ncustomer relationships to create demand\nrevenue streams generated by the value proposition(s)\nresources needed to make the business model possible\nactivities necessary to implement the business model\npartners who participate in the business and their motivations for doing\nso\ncost structure resulting from the business model\nThe business model canvas (see Figure 1.1) presents a visual overview\nof the nine components of a business on one page. In this book, Alexander\nOsterwalder’s business model canvas serves as the scorecard for the customer\ndiscovery process described in Step One. Osterwalder’s book Business Model\nGeneration (Wiley, 2010) provides the structure for the canvas.\nBusiness Model Canvas (Figure 1.1)\nAs a startup moves through the Customer Development process, it will\nuse the business model canvas as a scorecard, by posting the hypotheses\nabout each component of the model and then revising the hypotheses as the\nfounders gather facts. Think of your first version of the business model\ncanvas as the starting point showing the hypotheses that must be confirmed in\nface-to-face or online interaction with customers. More often than not, the\ncustomers will reject components of the business model, saying, “I’d rather\nbuy that from a retailer,” or, “The product needs to have these features to be\nimportant to me.” As customers approve or dispute the business model\nhypotheses, the company either accepts the customers’ approval or pivots to\nchange its business model to better target the opportunity.\nUsing the business model canvas as a guide makes it easier to figure out\nwhere and how to pivot, since the team can visually diagram its alternatives\nand see what it needs to change. Each time the founders iterate or pivot (see\nRule No. 4) in response to customer feedback, they draw a new canvas\nshowing the changes. Over time, these multiple canvases form a “flip book”\nthat shows the evolution of the business model. Agile startups can end up\nwith a six-inch-thick stack of business model diagrams they can burn at the\nIPO-celebration bonfire.\nMuch more about how to use business model diagrams to “keep score”\nthroughout the customer discovery process can be found in Chapter 2.\n...hypothesis is just a fancy word for “guess.”\nRule No. 6:\nDesign Experiments and Test to Validate Your\nHypotheses\nInitially, hypothesis is just a fancy word for “guess.” To turn hypotheses into\nfacts, founders need to get out of the building and test them in front of\ncustomers. But how do you test? And what do you want to learn from the\ntests? Testing and learning require you to be thoughtful on constructing and\ndesigning your tests. We call this “designing the experiments.”\nCustomer Development experiments are short, simple, objective\npass/fail tests. You’re looking for a strong signal in the signal/noise noise\nratio, something like five of the first 12 customers you call on saying “I need\nthis right now, even if it’s still buggy.” Early tests aren’t necessarily precise,\nbut should give you a “good enough” signal to proceed.\nThe Customer Development Insight Cycle (Figure 1.2)\nStart by asking yourself, “What insight do I need to move forward?”\nThen ask, “What’s the simplest test I can run to get it?” Finally, think about,\n“How do I design an experiment to run this simple test?”\nOne of the things that trips up engineering founders is thinking that\nthese tests have to be actual code, hardware or the real product. Most of the\ntime you can mock-up the web page or create a demo or physical prototype to\nelicit valuable learning.\nRule No. 7:\nAgree on Market Type. It Changes Everything\nOne of the radical insights guiding this book is that not all startups are alike.\nOne of the key ways in which they are different is in the relationship between\na startup’s new product and its market. These product/market relationships\ngenerally fit one of these descriptions:\nbringing a new product into an existing market\nbringing a new product into a new market\nbringing a new product into an existing market and trying to:\nre-segment that market as a low-cost entrant or\nre-segment that market as a niche entrant\ncloning a business model that’s successful in another country\nWhat confused entrepreneurs for decades is that the traditional product\nintroduction model works when introducing a product into an existing market\nwith a known business model (i.e., known customers, channels and markets).\nHowever, since the majority of startups are not pursuing known markets\n(those in new or re-segmented categories), they don’t really know who their\ncustomers will be. These types of startups are searching for a repeatable and\nscalable business model.\nMarket type influences everything a company does.\nMarket type influences everything a company does. Strategy and tactics\nthat work for one market type seldom work for another. Market type\ndetermines the startup’s customer feedback and acquisition activities and\nspending. It changes customer needs, adoption rates, product features and\npositioning as well as its launch strategies, channels and activities. In sum,\ndifferent market types require dramatically different discovery, MVPs, and\nsales and marketing strategies.\nIn existing markets, where customers exist, marketing is relatively easy:\nusers can describe the market and the attributes that matter the most to them.\nThe new product or service typically runs faster, does something better or\ncheaper, or otherwise improves on a customer-defined attribute. Users, the\nmarket, and competitors are known, and competition involves comparing the\nproduct and its features with others.\nIn a new market, a company lets customers do something they couldn’t do\nbefore by creating something that never existed before. Or it dramatically\nlowers costs to create a new class of users. By definition, new markets have\nno customers yet, so there’s nobody to know what the product can do or why\nthey should buy. This makes getting feedback and creating demand\nparticularly challenging, since the product is unknown to users and the\nmarket is undefined and unknown, and costly to develop.\nThe key isn’t competing, but instead understanding whether a large\ncustomer base exists and whether customers can be persuaded to buy. A\nclassic founder error in a new market is the “fast-burn” spending of sales and\nmarketing funds, a practice that may be appropriate when selling to existing\ncustomers in a known market, but makes no sense in a new market. The newvs.-existing axis is at the core of the market-type definition.\nRe-segmenting an existing market is useful when the incumbent is too\ndifficult to attack head-on (like Amazon, Facebook, or Microsoft). A resegmentation strategy is based on the startup’s market and customer\nknowledge, ideally identifying a market opportunity that incumbents are\nmissing, which usually takes one of two forms: a low-cost strategy or a niche\nstrategy. (Unlike differentiation, segmentation forges a distinct spot in\ncustomers’ minds that is unique, valuable, and in demand.)\nLow-cost re-segmentation is just what it sounds like. Are there\ncustomers at the low end of an existing market who will buy “good enough”\nperformance at a substantially lower price?\nNiche re-segmentation looks at an existing market and asks whether\nsome segment of this market would buy a new product designed to address\nmore specific needs. Can some sizable portion of the market be convinced\nthat a characteristic of the new product is radical enough to change the rules\nand shape of an existing market. See Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne’s\nwork on “Blue Ocean Strategy” for another way to think of re-segmenting a\nmarket.\nCloning an existing business model is a powerful technique when an\nexisting business has been proven in one country but has not yet been\nintroduced in another. Startups in Russia, India, Indonesia, Brazil, Japan and\nChina (each with its own large local market and language and cultural\nbarriers) can adopt, borrow, or copy a successful American business model\nand customize it for local language and buying preferences. (Soon ideas from\nthose countries will be cloned in the U.S.)\nFor example, Baidu in China and Yandex in Russia are the equivalent of\nGoogle in their respective markets. And Qzone, RenRen, PengYou and\nKaixin are the Facebooks of China, while Vkontakte and Odnoklassniki play\nthe same role in Russia.\nStartup companies generally enter one of these four market types and\nultimately must commit to one. The consequences of a wrong market-type\nchoice will prove to be severe in the customer creation stage. While market\ntype is ultimately a “late-binding decision,” a working hypothesis helps frame\nearly customer discovery issues. Market-type decision-making is explored in\ngreater detail in Chapter 2.\n...the few financial metrics to track: cash-burn rate,\nnumber of months’ worth of cash left...\nRule No. 8:\nStartup Metrics Differ from Those in Existing\nCompanies\nWe now have several centuries’ worth of performance metrics for existing\nbusinesses—P&Ls balance sheets, cash-flow forecasts and line-of-business\nanalyses, plus scores of others. Here’s hoping your startup becomes big\nenough to need them someday. In the past (not so long ago), we used these\ntools with startups because we didn’t know what else to measure. We now\nknow that startup metrics should focus on tracking the startup’s progress\nconverting guesses and hypotheses into incontrovertible facts rather than\nmeasuring the execution of a static plan. It’s critical that board and\nmanagement continuously test and measure each hypothesis until the entire\nbusiness model is worth scaling into a company.\nIf the company is venture-backed, management and investors must agree\non a set of metrics that truly matter and work toward a report or “dashboard”\nthat essentially replaces the P&L, cash flow, and balance sheet as\ncenterpieces of early board meetings.\nStartup metrics track the results of pass/fail tests and the iterations they lead\nto:\nHave the customer problem and product features been validated?\nDoes the minimum feature set resonate with customers?\nWho in fact is the customer, and have initial customer-related\nhypotheses on the likes of value proposition, customer segments, and\nchannels been validated through face-to-face customer interaction?\nCustomer-validation questions might include: average order size,\ncustomer lifetime value, average time to first order, rate of sales pipeline\ngrowth, improvement in close rate, and revenue per salesperson.\nIn addition to the startup metrics above, the relatively few financial\nmetrics that a startup board should be tracking are cash-burn rate, number of\nmonths’ worth of cash left, short-term hiring plans, and amount of time until\nthe company reaches cash-flow break-even.\nMake sure decisions are fact-based, not faith-based.\nRule No. 9:\nFast Decision-Making, Cycle Time, Speed and\nTempo\nSpeed matters at startups where the only absolute certainty is that the bank\nbalance declines every day. While Rule No. 4 addresses iterations and pivots,\nit doesn’t specify how long they should take. Unequivocally, the faster the\nbetter, since the faster these “learn, build, pivot” or “iterate, build” cycles\nhappen, the greater the odds of finding a scalable business model with the\ncash on hand. If cycles happen too slowly, the startup runs out of cash and\ndies. The biggest impediment to cycle time is psychological: it requires the\nadmission of being wrong or even of suffering a short-term tactical defeat.\nWhile pivots and iterations are about speed outside the building, speed\nalso matters inside the company. Most startup decisions are made in the face\nof uncertainty. There’s seldom a clear-cut, perfect solution to any\nengineering, customer or competitor problem, and founders shouldn’t\nagonize over trying to find one. This doesn’t mean gambling with the\ncompany’s fortunes on a whim. It means adopting plans with an acceptable\ndegree of risk and doing so quickly. (Make sure these decisions are factbased, not faith-based.) In general, the company that consistently makes and\nimplements decisions rapidly gains a tremendous, often-decisive competitive\nadvantage.\n...startups should make reversible decisions before\nanyone leaves the CEO’s office.\nStartup decisions have two states: reversible and irreversible. A\nreversible decision could be adding or dropping a product feature or a new\nalgorithm in the code or targeting a specific set of customers. If the decision\nproves a bad one, it can be unwound in a reasonable period of time. An\nirreversible decision such as firing an employee, launching a product, or\nsigning a long lease on expensive office space is usually difficult or\nimpossible to reverse.\nStartups should as policy, make reversible decisions before anyone\nleaves the CEO’s office or before a meeting ends. Perfect decision-making is\nboth unimportant and impossible, and what matters more is forward\nmomentum and a tight, fact-based feedback loop to quickly recognize and\nreverse bad decisions. By the time a big company gets the committee to get\nthe subcommittee to pick a meeting date, most startups have made 20\ndecisions, reversed five, and implemented the other 15.\nLearning to make decisions quickly is just part of the equation. Agile\nstartups have mastered another trick: tempo—the ability to make quick\ndecisions consistently and at all levels in the company. Speed and tempo are\nintegral parts of startup DNA, and a great startup’s tempo is often 10 times\nthat of a large company.\nRule No. 10:\nIt’s All About Passion\nA startup without driven, passionate people is dead the day it opens its doors.\n“Startup people” are different. They think different. In contrast, most people\nare great at execution. They work to live, do their jobs well, and enjoy their\nfamily, their lives, their hobbies and often even enjoy mowing the lawn.\nThey’re terrific at executing fixed tasks, and it’s a wonderful life for almost\neveryone.\nThe people leading almost every successful startup in history are just\ndifferent. They’re a very tiny percentage of the world population, and their\nbrains are wired for chaos, uncertainty, and blinding speed. They’re\nirrationally focused on customer needs and delivering great products. Their\njob is their life. It’s not 9-to-5, it’s 24/7. These are the people who found\nhigh-growth, highly-successful scalable startups.\nStartups demand execs who are comfortable with\nuncertainty, chaos and change.\nRule No. 11:\nStartup Job Titles Are Very Different from a Large\nCompany’s\nIn an existing company, job titles reflect the way tasks are organized to\nexecute a known business model. For example, the “Sales” title in an existing\ncompany means there’s a sales team repeatedly selling a known product to a\nwell-understood group of customers, using a standard corporate presentation\nwith an existing price list and standard terms, conditions and contract. The\n“Sales” title in an existing company is all about execution around a series of\nknowns.\nCompared with big companies, startups need executives whose skills are\n180 degrees different. Startups demand execs who are comfortable with\nuncertainty, chaos and change—with presentations and offers changing\ndaily, with the product changing often, with probing and gaining insights\nfrom failure rather than high-fiving a success. In short, they need the rare\nbreed:\nopen to learning and discovery—highly curious, inquisitive, and creative\neager to search for a repeatable and scalable business model\nagile enough to deal with daily change and operating “without a map”\nreadily able to wear multiple hats, often on the same day\ncomfortable celebrating failure when it leads to learning and iteration\nWe suggest replacing traditional execution-oriented sales, marketing and\nbusiness development titles with a single title: the Customer Development\nteam. At first, this “team” will consist of the company’s founder(s), who talks\nwith customers to gain enough insights to develop the minimum viable\nproduct. Later, as the startup moves into customer validation, the team may\ngrow to include a dedicated “sales closer” responsible for the logistics of\ngetting early orders signed. The closer shouldn’t be confused with a\ntraditional sales VP. To succeed in this process, the team must have:\nthe ability to listen to customer objections and understand whether they\nare issues about the product, the presentation, the pricing or something\nelse (or the wrong type of customer)\nexperience in talking to and moving between customers and engineers\nconfidence amid a state of constant change, often operating “without a\nmap”\nthe ability to walk in their customers’ shoes, understanding how they\nwork and the problems they face\nSome would say this checklist isn’t bad for identifying great entrepreneurs.\nRule No. 12:\nPreserve All Cash Until Needed. Then Spend.\nThe goal of Customer Development is not to avoid spending money but to\npreserve cash while searching for the repeatable and scalable business\nmodel. Once found, then spend like there’s no tomorrow. This paragraph is\nworth deconstructing:\nPreserve cash: When a startup has unlimited cash (Internet bubbles,\nfrothy venture climate), it can iterate on its mistakes by burning more dollars.\nWhen money is tight, without dollars to redo mistakes, it’s crucial to\nminimize waste. The Customer Development process preserves cash by not\nhiring any sales and marketing staff until the founders turn hypotheses into\nfacts and discover a viable product/market fit.\nWhile searching: Customer Development observes that at the start, the\ncompany and its business model are based solely on hypotheses, not facts,\nand that the founders need to get out of the building to turn these hypotheses\ninto customer data. This “get out of the building” approach, combined with\nrapid iteration and pivots, is central to the model’s customer discovery and\nvalidation steps.\n...preserve cash while searching for the repeatable\nand scalable business model...\nRepeatable: Startups may get orders that stem from board members’\ncustomer relationships, engineering one-offs, or heroic single-shot efforts by\nthe CEO. These are great, but they aren’t repeatable by a sales organization.\nSearch not for the one-off revenue hits but rather for a pattern that can be\nreplicated by a sales organization selling off a price list or by customers\nregularly visiting the website.\nScalable: The goal is not to get one customer but many—and for each\nadditional customer to add incremental revenue and profit. The test is: Does\nthe addition of one more salesperson or more marketing dollars bring in more\ngross profit (or users or clicks) than you invested? Who influences a sale?\nWho recommends a sale? Who is the decision-maker? Who is the economic\nbuyer? Where’s the budget for purchasing this type of product? What’s the\ncustomer acquisition cost? Affirming the repeatable, scalable sales model is\nthe customer validation step of Customer Development, its most important\nphase. Has the team learned how to sell a target customer? Can this happen\nbefore the startup runs out of money?\nSearch not for the one-off revenue hits but rather\nfor a pattern...\nBusiness model: A business model answers the basic questions of how\nthe company makes money. Is this a revenue play, or is it a freemium model\nseeking users? Something else? Who’s the customer?\nSpend like there’s no tomorrow: The goal of an investor-backed startup\nis not to build a lifestyle business. The goal is to reach venture scale (10\ntimes the return on investment or more). When management and board agree\nthat they’ve found a repeatable and scalable sales model (i.e., have a\nproduct/market fit), then invest the dollars to create end-user demand and\ndrive those customers into the sales channel.\nRule No. 13:\nCommunicate and Share Learning\nAn integral part of Customer Development’s “learning and discovery”\nphilosophy is sharing everything that’s learned outside the building with\nemployees, co-founders and even investors.\nThe traditional way to do this is via weekly company meetings to keep\nemployees informed and board meetings to let the investors understand the\nprogress made in the search for the business model. But technology in the\n21st-century has taken us to places we never could get to before. We can now\ncommunicate all we’re learning in near-real time to everyone who needs to\nknow.\nWe strongly recommend that the founders keep and share all their\nactivities in the customer discovery step via a blog, CRM or product\nmanagement tool. A powerful tool to help founding team members and their\ninvestors and advisors communicate about progress in evolving their business\nmodel and sharing or discussing customer discovery has been developed in\nconcert with the authors and can be found at LaunchPadCentral.com. It\nrecords hypotheses the startup started with, who the team has talked to, the\nquestions asked, the tests conducted, what’s been learned, and questions for\nadvisors or investors. While this may seem burdensome, it takes less time\nthan having a weekly coffee with an advisory board member. What results is\na communications tool allowing outsiders to view the company’s progress up\nclose and to offer suggestions and course corrections.\nRule No. 14:\nCustomer Development Success Begins With BuyIn\nCustomer Development’s “learning and discovery” philosophy can be\nimmensely disorienting to a founder, engineer or investor who has spent his\nor her career executing a plan. For Customer Development to succeed,\neveryone on the team—from investor or parent company to engineers,\nmarketeers and founders—needs to understand and agree that the Customer\nDevelopment process is different to its core. If the engineering VP is talking\nwaterfall development or the board demands a rigid timetable, Customer\nDevelopment is destined for disaster. Everyone must accept the process,\nrecognizing that this is a fluid, nonlinear search for a business model that can\nsometimes last for years.\nThe Customer Development process is different to\nits core.\nCustomer Development changes almost every aspect of startup behavior,\nperformance, metrics, and, as often as not, success potential. It’s not just a\n“nice to do” while executing the revenue model in the back of the business\nplan. Customer Development reinvents the business model on the fly,\niterating often and pivoting whenever indicated. Founders need to have the\ncommitment of the team and board before embarking on Customer\nDevelopment. Ensure that all understand and agree that it’s iterative,\nnecessary, and worthwhile and that it changes the benchmarks and metrics\nalong the way.\nComments such as “The product is already spec’ed, and we can’t change\nthe features since development is already underway,” or “We already have\nthe factory (or sales team or marketing materials) built,” or “We have to\nlaunch to make the numbers in the plan,” are all red flags. To succeed at\nCustomer Development, the company must abandon the old model’s\nemphasis on execution of a fantasy business plan. Instead it must commit to a\nCustomer Development process stressing learning, discovery, failure, and\niteration in the search for a successful business model. If you’re ready for this\nprocess, this book will tell you how to do it.\nSummary: The Customer Development\nProcess\nThe Customer Development process reflects the best practices of winning\nstartups. It is the only approach for web-based businesses where failure is\ncertain without constant customer feedback and product iteration as they\nsearch for their audiences. Customer Development’s fast cycle times and\ninherent cash conservation gives all entrepreneurs more chances to pivot,\niterate, and succeed before the bank account runs dry. Describe this model to\nentrepreneurs who have taken companies all the way to a lucrative exit and\nbeyond, and heads nod in recognition.\nWhile each step has its own specific objectives, the process as a whole\nhas one overarching goal: discovering the repeatable, scalable, and ultimately\nprofitable business before running out of cash. This transforms the company\nfrom a set of founding hypotheses into a moneymaking endeavor.\nCustomer Development is damn hard work. You\ncan’t fake it.\nCustomer Development is damn hard work. You can’t fake it. You can’t\njust do the slides or “do” the process in a weekend. It’s a full-time, full-bodycontact sport. It’s a long-term commitment to changing the way a startup is\nbuilt.

Founded by Motorola and a global partnership of\n18 companies in 1991, Iridium planned to build a mobile telephone system\nthat would work “anywhere on Earth,” from ships in the middle of the ocean\nto the jungles of Africa to remote mountain peaks where no cell towers\nexisted.\nHow? With an out-of-this-world business plan. First, the company\nbought a fleet of 15 rockets from Russia, the U.S. and China. Next, it\nlaunched an armada of 72 private satellites into orbit, where they acted like\n500-mile-high cell towers providing phone coverage to any spot on Earth.\nSeven years after Iridium’s founding, its satellites were in place. But nine\nmonths after the first call was made in 1998, the company was in Chapter 11\nbankruptcy. When Iridium crashed back to Earth, it ranked as one of the\nlargest startup failures on record. What went wrong?\nWhen Iridium was founded in 1991, worldwide cell-phone coverage was\nsparse, unreliable and expensive. Cell-phone handsets were the size of lunch\nboxes. Iridium put together a business plan that made assumptions about\ncustomers, their problems and the product needed to solve those problems.\nOther assumptions about sales channel, partnerships, and revenue model all\nadded up to a set of financial forecasts that Iridium would soon be printing\nmoney.\nOne of the largest startup failures on record as they\nexecuted their business plan.\nBut in the seven-plus years it took Iridium to go from concept to launch,\ninnovation in mobile- and cell-phone networks moved at blinding speed. By\nthe time Iridium launched, there were far fewer places on the planet where\ncell-phone service was unavailable. Traditional cell-phone companies\nprovided coverage in the most valuable parts of the world. Prices for cell\nservice shrunk as fast as phone handsets did. In contrast, Iridium’s satellite\nphone was bigger than a brick and weighed about as much. Worse, Iridium’s\ncell phone couldn’t make calls from cars or buildings, since it required lineof-sight “connection” to the satellites. Instead of 50 cents per minute for a\nregular cell call, Iridium’s calls cost $7 a minute, plus $3,000 for the handset\nitself.\nIridium’s potential market shrunk nearly every day. Instead of a massive\nworldwide market of potential users, it had drawn only a small group willing\nto pay its prices and put up with the product’s many limitations. But\nIridium’s business model assumptions and plans were firmly fixed as if it was\nstill 1991. The company spent $5 billion building a business over eight years\nwithout ever focusing on four key questions:\nHave we identified a problem a customer wants to see solved?\nDoes our product solve this customer problem or need?\nIf so, do we have a viable and profitable business model?\nHave we learned enough to go out and sell?\nAnswering these questions is the purpose of the first step in the\ncustomer discovery process. This chapter explains how to go about it.\n(Twenty years later, Iridium emerged from bankruptcy. In 2000, an\ninvestor group bought $6 billion worth of its assets for $25 million. After a\nlong climb back, the company celebrated its 500,000\nth customer in September\n2011.)\nCustomers don’t behave like your business plan.\nThe Customer Discovery Philosophy\nA startup begins with the vision of its founders: a vision of a new product or\nservice that solves a customer’s problems or needs and of how it will reach\nits many customers. Customer discovery lowers the odds of spending zillions\nand getting zeros in return as the Iridium team did. So the No. 1 goal of\ncustomer discovery amounts to this: turning the founders’ initial hypotheses\nabout their market and customers into facts.\nGet Out of the Building\nFacts exist only outside the building, where customers live, so the most\nimportant aspect of customer discovery is getting out of the building, in front\nof customers. And not for a few days or a week, but repeatedly, over weeks if\nnot months. This critical task can’t be assigned to junior staffers and must be\ndriven by founders. Only after the founders have performed this step will\nthey know whether they have a valid vision or just a hallucination.\nSounds simple, doesn’t it? But for anyone who has worked in\nestablished companies, the customer discovery process is disorienting. All the\nrules about new-product management in large companies are turned upside\ndown. It’s instructive to enumerate all things you are not going to do:\nunderstand the needs and wants of all customers\nmake a list of all the features customers want before they buy your\nproduct\nhand Product Development a features list of the sum of all customer\nrequests\nhand Product Development a detailed marketing-requirements document\nrun focus groups and test customers’ reactions to your product to see if\nthey will buy\nWhat you are going to do is develop your product for the few, not the\nmany. Moreover, you’re going to start building your product even before you\nknow whether you have any customers for it.\nOn a startups first day, there’s limited—if any—\ncustomer input.\nFor an experienced marketing or product management executive, these\nideas are not only disorienting and counterintuitive but heretical. Why aren’t\nthe needs of all potential customers important? What is it about a first\nproduct from a new company that’s different from follow-on products in a\nlarge company? What is it about a startup’s first customers that make the\nrules so different?\nSearch for the Problem/Solution Fit\nThe customer discovery process searches for problem/solution fit: “have we\nfound a problem lots of people want us to solve (or a need they want us to\nfill)” and “does our solution (a product, a website, or an app) solve the\nproblem in a compelling way?” At its core, the essence of customer discovery\nis to determine whether your startup’s value proposition matches the\ncustomer segment it plans to target.\nProblem/solution fit is virtually identical to what’s sometimes called\n“product/ market fit,” as the previous paragraph indicates. As a result, we use\nthe terms somewhat interchangeably throughout the book. Do realize,\nhowever, that in multi-sided markets, there may be multiple value\npropositions and multiple customer segments. But problem/solution fit is\nonly achieved when the revenue model, pricing, and customer acquisition\nefforts all match up with the customers’ needs.\nDevelop the Product for the Few, Not the Many\nIn existing companies, the goal of traditional product management and\nmarketing is to develop a market-requirements document (MRD) for\nengineering that contains the sum of all possible customer feature requests,\nprioritized in a collaborative effort among Product Management, Marketing,\nSales, and Engineering. Marketing or Product Management hosts focus\ngroups, analyzes sales data from the field, and looks at customer feature\nrequests and complaints. This information leads to the adding of requested\nfeatures to the product specification, and the engineering team builds them\ninto the next product release.\nWhile this process is rational for an established company entering an\nexisting market, it’s folly for startups. Why? Startups aren’t small versions of\nlarge, existing companies where there’s plenty of customer knowledge and\ninput. In established companies, the MRD process ensures that engineering\nwill build a product that appeals to existing customers in a known market,\nwhere customers and their needs are known. On a startup’s first day, there’s\nlimited—if any—customer input for creating a formal product specification.\nIn a startup, the first product is not designed to satisfy a mainstream\ncustomer. No startup can afford to build a product with every feature a\nmainstream customer needs all at once. The product would take years to get\nto market and be obsolete by the time it arrived. Instead, successful startups\nsolve this conundrum by focusing development and early selling efforts on a\nvery small group of early customers who have bought into the startup’s\nvision. These visionary customers will give the company the feedback\nnecessary to add features to the product over time.\nEarlyvangelists are willing to make a leap of faith\nand buy an early product.\nEarlyvangelists: The Most Important Customers of\nAll\nEnthusiasts who spread the good news about your product to friends, family\nor co-workers are often called evangelists. But a new word is needed to\ndescribe the early adopters—the visionary customers—who buy unfinished\nand untested products, because they want to “first,” whether it’s for the sake\nof gaining a competitive edge or winning bragging rights. We call these early\nadopters earlyvangelists. Unlike “mainstream” business or consumer-product\ncustomers who want to buy a finished, completed, tested product,\nearlyvangelists are willing to make a leap of faith and buy an early product\nfrom a startup. Every industry has a small subset of visionaries willing to take\na leap of faith on an early product.\nOne of the mistakes that startup founders make is to give away or\nheavily discount early alpha/beta products to blue-chip customers. In singlesided markets (where the user is the payer) earlyvangelists will be happy to\npay for early access to the product. If they won’t, they aren’t earlyvangelists.\nTheir willingness to pay is a critical part of the customer discovery process.\nYou’ll use it to test the entire buying process.\nEarlyvangelist Characteristics (Figure 2.1)\nEarlyvangelists are willing or eager accelerators of\nyour viral growth.\nIn both physical and web/mobile channels, earlyvangelists display these\ncommon characteristics (see Figure 2.1):\nThey have a problem or need.\nThey understand they have a problem.\nThey’re actively searching for a solution and have a timetable for\nfinding it.\nThe problem is so painful that they’ve cobbled together an interim\nsolution.\nThey’ve committed, or can quickly acquire, budget dollars to purchase.\nThink of earlyvangelists’ characteristics along a scale of customer pain.\nEarlyvangelist customers will be found only at the top of the scale—those\nwho have already been looking for a solution, built a home-grown solution\n(whether in a company by building a software solution or at home by taping\ntogether a fork, a light bulb and a vacuum cleaner) and have or can acquire a\nbudget. These people are perfect earlyvangelist candidates. They can be\nrelied on for feedback and initial sales; they’ll tell others about the product\nand spread the word that the vision is real. Moreover, they can be potential\nadvisory board candidates (more about advisory boards in Chapter 5).\nBuild a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) First\nThe idea that a startup builds its product for a small group of initial customers\nrather than devising a generic mainstream spec is radical. What follows is\nequally revolutionary.\nThe goal of the MVP is to build the smallest possible\nfeature set.\nOn the day the company starts, there is very limited customer input. All\nthe startup has is a vision of what the problem, product and solution seem to\nbe. Unfortunately, it’s either a vision or a hallucination. The company doesn’t\nknow who its initial customers are or what features they’ll want. One option\nis to start developing an entire full-featured first release of the product, with\nevery feature the founders can think of. We now know this results in wasted\nengineering effort, time and cash, as customers don’t use, want or need most\nof the features developed without their input.\nAnother path is to put Product Development on hold until the Customer\nDevelopment team can find customers who can provide adequate feedback.\nThe risk here is lost time and no product for customers to provide feedback\nagainst. A third, more productive approach is to develop the core features of\nthe product (incrementally and iteratively with agile engineering methods),\nwith the feature list driven by the vision and experience of the company’s\nfounders. This is a minimum viable product.\nThe goal of customer discovery is to test your understanding of the\ncustomer’s problem and see if your proposed solution will prompt him to use\nor buy the product based on its most important features alone. Most users\nwant finished products, but earlyvangelists are the perfect target for the MVP.\nTailor the initial product release to satisfy their needs. If no one thinks your\nMVP solution is interesting or sufficient, iterate or pivot until an adequate\nnumber say “yes.”\nThe shift in thinking to an incremental and iterative MVP as opposed to\na fully featured first product release is important. Engineers tend to make a\nproduct bigger and more perfect. The MVP helps them focus the most\nimportant and indispensable features. Your goal in having an MVP is not to\ngather feature requests to change the product or to make the feature set larger.\nInstead, the goal is to put the MVP in front of customers to find out whether\nyou understood the customer problem well enough to define key elements of\nthe solution. Then you iteratively refine the solution. If, and only if, no\ncustomers can be found for the most important features of the MVP, bring\ncustomers’ additional feature requests to the product development team. In\nthe Customer Development model, feature requests to an MVP are by\nexception and iteration rather than by rule. This eliminates the endless list of\nfeature requests that often delay first customer ship and drive product\ndevelopment teams crazy.\nUse the Business Model Canvas as The Customer\nDiscovery Scorecard\nOften there’s a lack of a shared and clear understanding of the business\nmodel throughout the company. This customer discovery step uses Alexander\nOsterwalder’s business model canvas to diagrammatically illustrate how a\ncompany intends to make money. As shown in Figure 2.2 the canvas\nrepresents any company in nine boxes, depicting the details of a company’s\nproduct, customers, channels, demand creation, revenue models, partners,\nresources, activities and cost structure. (We described the business model\ncanvas in detail in the Customer Development Manifesto.)\nBusiness Model Canvas (Figure 2.2)\nIn this phase you’ll develop a one- or two-page brief about each of the\nfollowing boxes in the business model canvas:\nMarket Size: how big the opportunity is\nValue Proposition, Part 1: the product/service, its benefits and minimum\nviable product\nCustomer Segments: who the customer is and what problems the\nproduct solves\nChannels: how the product will be distributed and sold\nCustomer Relationships: how demand will be created\nValue Proposition, Part 2: market-type hypothesis and competitive set/\ndifferentiation\nKey Resources: suppliers, commodities, or other essential elements of\nthe business\nKey Partners: other enterprises essential to success of the business\nRevenue Streams: revenue and profit sources and size\nWhen you first draft your initial hypotheses your canvas begins to fill\nup, looking like Figure 2.3.\nSample Business Model Canvas—Initial Hypotheses (Figure 2.3)\nBut in addition to using the business model canvas as a static snapshot\nof the business at a single moment, frozen in time, Customer Development\nuses the canvas as a “scorecard” to track progress in searching for a business\nmodel.\nOnce a week update the canvas to reflect any pivots or iterations,\nhighlighting in red the changes from the last week.\nThen after you and your team agree on the changes to your business\nmodel, integrate them into what becomes your new canvas for the week (the\naccepted changes in red are then shown in black). During the next week any\nnew changes are again shown in red. Then the process repeats each week –\nnew changes showing up in red. Then a new canvas used for the week.\nThis method highlights the changes over time for your and the team’s\nreference. Figure 2.4 shows how the canvases will look over time.\nUsing the Business Model Canvas as a Weekly Scorecard (Figure 2.4)\nHad they read this book, and gotten out of the building, the folks at\nIridium might have saved billions by learning just how small the market for\ntheir business had become. It would have allowed them to search for\nalternatives and survival.\nTo sum up the customer discovery philosophy: whether there’s\nproduct/market fit by finding earlyvangelists, understanding their needs, and\nverifying that the initial minimum viable product solves a problem they’ll\neagerly pay to have solved. And if not, use near-continuous customer\nfeedback to drive agile, frequent changes in product and business model\nalike.\nAs you complete the hypothesis development, your business model\ncanvas quickly becomes multi-dimensional. You are really developing three\ninitial canvases:\nCore elements of the business model itself (value proposition, channel,\netc.)\nHypotheses you have for each element of the business model (such as\n“people will want these features, “or “customers will buy our product\nbecause...”)\nAnd a layer outlining the key pass/fail tests you will use to get face-toface with customers and use their feedback to convert your hypotheses\ninto facts.\nOverview of Customer Discovery\nCustomer Discovery: Overview of the Process (Figure 2.5)\nCustomer Discovery has Four Phases\nPhase 1 deconstructs the founders’ vision into the nine parts of the business\nmodel canvas (product, customers, channels, demand creation, revenue\nmodels, partners, resources, activities and cost structure). Then your team\nwrites one-page briefs about each of the hypotheses, including the list of\nexperiments or tests you’ll need to conduct to prove or disprove each one.\nIn Phase 2 you conduct experiments to test your “problem” hypotheses. This\nhelps you understand how important the problem is and how big it can\nbecome. You do so by testing most elements of the business model, including\nthe value proposition, pricing, channel strategy, and sales process. Your goal\nis to turn hypotheses into facts or discard them if they’re wrong, and replace\nthem with new hypotheses. In the process, you’ll gain a deep understanding\nof customers’ business, workflow, organization, and product needs. When all\nthe facts are in, update your results on the canvas.\nIn Phase 3, you test your “solution,” presenting your value proposition\n(product, pricing, features, and other business model components) and the\nminimum viable product to customers and compare their responses to the\n“pass/fail” goals you developed earlier. The goal is not to sell the product, but\nto validate how well you understood the problem in Phase 2 when you heard\ncustomers say, “Even these minimum features solve our problems,” or, “I\nneed this product.” Ideally, customers ask, “When can I get it?”\nIn Phase 4 you stop and assess the results of the experiments you’ve\nconducted and verify that you have:\na full understanding of customers’ problems, passions, or needs\nconfirmed the value proposition solves problems, passions or needs\ndetermined that a sizable volume of customers exists for the product\nlearned what customers will pay for the product\nmade certain the resulting revenue should deliver a profitable business\nWith your product features and business model validated, decide\nwhether you have learned enough to go out and try to sell a select your\nproduct to a few visionary customers, or whether you need to go back to\ncustomers to learn some more. If, and only if, you are successful in this step\ndo you proceed to customer validation.\nThat’s customer discovery in a nutshell. The remainder of this section\ndetails each of the phases just described.\nNow let’s get started.\n\nCHAPTER 3\nCustomer Discovery, Phase One: State\nYour Business Model Hypotheses\nTHE DIAGRAM ABOVE IS AN OVERVIEW OF PHASE 1 of customer discovery.\nNote that hypotheses for physical products often differ from web/mobile\nproducts. Where the hypothesis issues differ, each is described separately,\nphysical startups in the upper, lighter-tinted row and web/mobile startup\nconsiderations in the lower, darker row.\nThis phase starts by developing a rough market size estimate to size the\nopportunity for your new venture. Next, the rest of customer discovery uses\nthe business model canvas to record short summaries (hypothesis briefs) of\ninitial hypotheses about your business. The canvas provides a picture of the\nbusiness model on a single page, serving as a reference for team members\nand a scorecard keeping track of pivots and iterations as the company’s\nbusiness model changes.\nThe hypothesis briefs provide the detail, but remain short and to the\npoint, with enough clarity to ensure that all team members understand their\nmeaning. No hypothesis brief should be more than two pages, and as a rule,\nbullet points are far more helpful than paragraphs or even sentences. Almost\nevery hypothesis concludes with the experiments you’ll use in phases 2 and\n3, when you’re out of the building talking to customers to prove or disprove\nthe hypothesis. Sometimes you’ll even need to get out of the building to do\nsome research just to figure out what tests to conduct and the kinds of results\nto shoot for.\nInitially, some briefs may seem shockingly empty. Not to worry—these\nbriefs serve as an outline. The team will return to them often, filling in the\nblanks and modifying original hypotheses with new facts learned along the\nway.\nMarket Size Hypothesis\nThis brief is an outlier—it doesn’t directly map onto the business model\ncanvas. But because there’s nothing worse than spending years in a startup\nonly to discover that it can never grow to more than a few million dollars in\nrevenue, the market size hypotheses help you size the opportunity of your\nstartup market. Estimating market size helps determine whether the payoff\nfrom your new venture is worth the toil, sweat and tears, or whether you’re\nabout to do your first pivot.\nAligning investor and founder objectives clearly at the outset is good\n“life insurance” for founders, since few disconnects cost founders their jobs\nmore quickly than disputes over goals and gold.\n...few disconnects cost founders their jobs more\nquickly than disputes over goals and gold.\nThe thinking applies regardless of whether it’s in the physical or\nweb/mobile channel. With one exception: buyable startups founded for a fast\nsale to a larger-platform player like Facebook or Google. Buyable startups\nshould consider the size of what ís often a microsegment of a large market.\nMarket opportunities are fueled by three ingredients: a large number of\npotential active users or customers, clear future-user growth in a market with\nrapid and predictable growth, and the opportunity to attract active customers\nor users.\nTAM, SAM and Target Market\nMarketers and their investors typically think of market size as three numbers;\nTAM (total addressable market), SAM (served available market) and target\nmarket. The TAM for makers of a new smartphone app might be the 1 billion\ntotal smartphone owners worldwide, but if the application is available only in\nEnglish or works only on an iPhone, the SAM or potential market served is\nfar smaller. And the target market might be Apple App Store customers, so\nyour next step would be to estimate what percentage of those shoppers might\nactually buy. Each estimate further narrows the target market.\nTAM = how big is the universe\nSAM = how many can I reach with my sales channel\nTarget Market (for a startup) = who will be the most likely buyers\nTAM, SAM and Target Market (Figure 3.1)\nEstimating TAM and SAM and target market is a good starting point for\nthe market size hypothesis. Customers will help turn these hypotheses into\nfacts.\nA top-down estimate is a first step. Use industry-analyst reports, marketresearch reports, competitors’ press releases, university libraries—and\ndiscussions with investors and customers to “size” the overall market. Use\nwhatever metric is most appropriate—units, dollars, page views, eyeballs,\nwhatever.\nA note of caution: First-time entrepreneurs are seduced by market size\ndata from research firms. They should keep in mind that market research\nfirms are excellent at predicting the past. (If they were geniuses at predicting\nthe future, they’d be running hedge funds.)\nTherefore, a bottom-up estimate is usually more realistic for startups.\nToy makers, for example do this quite easily: there are roughly 2 million girls\nborn in the U.S. each year, and half can’t afford a $90 doll, so the U.S. target\nmarket for a new doll for girls age 6 to 8 is at most 3 million.\nMarket research firms are great at predicting the\npast.\nIn assessing an existing or re-segmented market, be sure to consider the\nadjacent markets that customers might switch from. Millions of BlackBerry\nusers traded in their RIM devices when Apple’s iPhone arrived, for example.\nWill the startup’s new product have the competitive power to encourage\nswitching? Count only the switchable subset and beware of long-term\ncontracts, service contracts, and “sunk costs” like training or installation, all\nof which are often hidden barriers to switching.\nOf course, nobody can compute a new market’s size today, since it\ndoesn’t exist yet. What to do? Estimate the opportunity based on proxies and\nadjacent markets. See if there are any comparable companies. Have others\ngrown as fast as the estimate? Why will this startup perform similarly?\nChecklist 3: Market Size\nGoal: Estimate the total market opportunity for the company\nReference: Chapter 4, Market Size Hypothesis\nEstimated market size:\nTAM or Total Available Market\nSAM or Served Available Market\nTarget Market\nEstimate current product and follow-on products\nAppropriate metric for measuring determined\nUnits/dollars/page views/other measures?\nPer member for subscription services/per page view for advertisingsupported businesses?\nResearch conducted to “size” the overall market\nRead industry analyst reports, market research reports, competitors’\npress releases, etc.\nTalk with investors and customers\nIf assessing an existing or resegmented market, adjacent markets that\ncustomers might switch from are considered\nWill the startup’s product encourage switching?\nOnly the switchable subset counted (Beware of long-term lock-ins\nfrom incumbents)\nGrowth computed for all customer sources over 3-5 years\nIf assessing a new market, the opportunities are estimated based on\nproxies and adjacent markets\nAre there comparable companies?\nHave others grown as fast as the estimate?\nWhy will this company perform similarly?\nExit criteria:\nWritten sense of market size, estimate of how much the company can\ncapture\nPass/Fail tests identified\nValue Proposition Hypothesis (Part 1)\nStart this step by filling out your canvas with the value proposition\nhypothesis: the product or service being offered to customers. You’ll include\ndetails about the product, its features and benefits, as well as the company’s\nlong-term product vision and its initial minimum viable product. Think of the\nvalue proposition as a contract between the customer and your company\nwhere the customer “hires” your startup to solve a problem.\nWrite a series of briefs that capture the founders’ hours of thinking,\ntalking, and brainstorming about the product in three separate, specific areas:\nProduct Vision\nProduct Features & Benefits\nMinimum Viable Product (MVP)\nThe product development team produces much of the product brief, one\nof the few times it’s asked to engage in a paper exercise. They put key value\nproposition hypotheses down on paper and turn them into briefs agreed to by\nall executives..\nProduct Vision\nThis portion of the value proposition brief captures your vision for what you\nwant your successful company to become.\nOver time, successful companies are usually more than a single product.\nWhat’s your long-term vision for your company? What do you want to\nultimately change? Are you going to do it with a series of products? How do\nyou expand into adjacent markets? How do you get people to change\nbehavior? What’s the world look like three years after you arrive on the\nscene? Five years after?\nShape a long-term vision with a short narrative told in bullet points. For\nexample in the 1990s, a financial software company might have described its\nuser story this way:\nConsumers hate to reconcile their checkbooks\nWe think we can develop a computer program that emulates a\ncheckbook.\nIt will automate all the hard and tedious parts of home banking\nConsumers can use it to pay bills by connecting to the Internet\nMillions of people will start using home computers to do something they\nnever did before\nToday small businesses use bookkeepers to keep their books\nAfter we succeed in automating consumers we will expand into financial\nsoftware for small businesses\nMillions of small businesses will start using computers to do something\nthey never did before\nSuddenly, the company vision is clear with a few simple bullet points.\nThe vision is critical because the Customer Development team has to paint a\npicture for earlyvangelists of what the product will look like a year or two\ninto the future.\nOnly because earlyvangelists are buying into your\ntotal vision will they spend money for an\nincomplete, buggy, barely functional first product.\nIn the long-term vision, the product team specifies the delivery date for\nthe MVP and for follow-on products or enhancements to the product as far\nout as the team can see (18 months to three years). In startups, this request\nusually elicits a response like, “How can I come up with future dates when\nwe barely know the first MVP delivery date?” Reassure your anxious product\ndevelopment team that this first pass at a schedule isn’t set in stone.\nOnly because earlyvangelists are buying into your total vision will they\nspend money for an incomplete, buggy, barely functional first product. The\nvision should convince everyone involved that this is an opportunity worth\nthe investment of millions of dollars and years of work. Ironically, few\nstartups end up with products that look like their initial vision.\nFinally, it’s never too early to think about strategic issues:\nWill it create network effects? A single fax machine was useless but\nbecame more valuable as more people acquired them\nCan you price it with a predictable pricing model—i.e., subscriptions\nversus one-time sales?\nCan you create customer lock-in/high switching costs? Think of trying\nto get your data from Facebook or from your doctor’s office\nCan you have high gross margins?\nDoes it have organic demand versus marketing spend? Companies with\norganic demand have business models that don’t require expensive\nmarketing. Think Google, eBay, Baidu, Skype, etc.\nProduct Features and Benefits\nThis portion of the value proposition brief captures what the product is and\nwhy people will use or buy it.\nWhile many engineers think new products are all about product features,\nthe product is just one of many elements of a successful startup. The product\nfeatures list is a one-page document consisting of one- or two-sentence\nsummaries of the top 10 (or fewer) features of the complete product vision.\n(If there’s some ambiguity in describing a particular feature, include a\nreference to a more detailed engineering document.)\nEssentially, the feature list is Product Development’s contract with the\nrest of the company. The biggest challenge will be deciding what features\nwill ship in what order. Developing the MVP will start the prioritization\nprocess. Once you get out of the building, customers will guide the process as\nthey begin interacting with the earliest version of the MVP.\nThink of features as the things engineering is building, and think of\nbenefits as the problem you’re solving for the customer.\nThink of benefits as the problem you’re solving for\nthe customer.\nOnce you have the feature list, you shape a product benefits list by\ndescribing the specific product benefits as seen through customers’ eyes.\n(Something new? Something better? Faster? Cheaper?) Then develop a “user\nstory.” This short narrative explains what job the product will do. How will it\nsolve a problem that customers are eager to fix, or fulfill a need they have?\nIdeally, the product solves a mission-critical problem, delivers a compelling,\nexciting consumer benefit, or addresses an unspoken need. (Saves money or\ntime? Relieves a symptom? Fun, relaxing, faster? Better? Cheaper?) A banksoftware company might describe its user story this way:\nCustomers always face long lines at our bank on Fridays and on the first\nand last days of the month when they come in to cash or deposit checks;\nthey get frustrated and often angry\nWe think we lose 5 percent to 8 percent of our customers as a result of\nfrustration\nWe can measure lost profits of about $500,000 a year, significant\nbecause it’s 7 percent of the total\nThis $150,000 software package halves the time it takes to make a\ndeposit and will be even faster in later versions\nWhen thinking about product features, remember that a value\nproposition can take the form of a higher-performance product or a less\nexpensive or more convenient product. It can address a market niche or\nsegment or solve problems in a new or different, faster or cheaper way.\nSometimes the product’s physical or visual design or even the brand itself\nmay be different enough to command attention. Products don’t always solve\nproblems, either. While most business products do, consumer goods more\noften serve needs in areas as diverse as online gaming, social networks,\nfashion, and cars.\nIt’s normal for marketers to want to describe the product benefits, but\nit’s likely that marketing doesn’t have facts about customers yet, just\nopinions. In a startup, the founders and Product Development are likely to be\nthe ones with the facts. So at this point, the marketing people would be wise\nto bite their tongues and listen to the product development group’s\nassumptions about the features and exactly how they’ll benefit customers.\nThese engineering-driven benefits represent hypotheses you’ll test against\nreal customer facts. In Phase 2, you’ll get out of the building to collect this\nfeedback directly from customers.\nMinimum Viable Product (MVP)\nThe MVP is the final portion of this first value proposition brief. It’s a\nconcise summary of the smallest possible group of features that will work as\na stand-alone product while still solving at least the “core” problem and\ndemonstrating the product’s value.\nThe MVP is:\na tactic for cutting back on wasted engineering hours\na strategy to get the product into earlyvangelists hands as soon as\npossible\na tool for generating maximum customer learning in the shortest\npossible time\nStart the MVP brief by defining what needs to be learned—and from\nwhom. Customer Development efforts will engage a very small group of\nearly visionary and passionate customers to guide product-feature\ndevelopment until a profitable business model emerges. The sooner the MVP\nis in their hands, the sooner feedback can arrive. Rather than asking\ncustomers explicitly about feature X, Y or Z, one approach to defining the\nMVP is to ask, “What is the smallest or least complicated problem that the\ncustomer will pay us to solve?”\nThis approach runs counter to the typical cry for more features, which is\noften based on what the competitors have or what the last customer visited\nhad to say. The MVP is the inverse of what most sales and marketing groups\nask of their development teams.\nA goal of Customer Development is to understand\nwhat not to ship.\nStartups tend to collect a list of features that, if added to the product,\nwould get just that one additional customer to buy. Soon a 10-page feature\nlist evolves just to sell to 10 customers. That’s a plan for failure. The goal of\nCustomer Development is not to collect features from customers. It’s to\nunderstand what not to ship. The perfect feature list is just one paragraph\nlong and can be sold to thousands or millions of customers. A core tenet of\nthe Customer Development Manifesto is “less is more.” Minimize the\nnumber of features not used by getting a MVP into customers’ hands as\nquickly as possible. An easy guideline: “no new features until you’ve\nexhausted the search for a business model.”\nChecklist 4: Product Vision\nGoal: Team agreement on the long-term vision and 18-month schedule\nReference: Chapter 3, Value Proposition Hypotheses/Product Vision\nVision\nWhat’s your long-term vision for your company?\nWhat do you ultimately want to change or solve?\nAre you going to do it with a series of products?\nHow do you expand into adjacent markets?\nDo you need to get people to change their behavior?\nWhat will the world look like 3 years after you arrive on the scene?\nFive years?\nPut together a short narrative in bullets about your strategy\nDelivery Dates\nMVP Delivery Date and features\n18-month product vision and delivery dates\nLong Term Product Strategy\nWill your product create network effects?\nCan you price it with a predicable model?\nCan you create customer lock-in/high switching costs?\nCan you have high gross margins?\nDoes it have organic demand versus requiring marketing spend?\nList product enhancements anticipated up to 18 months\nList key follow-on product enhancements\nExit criteria:\nVision\nNarrative\nLong-term product strategy\nUpdate your business model canvas\nPass/Fail tests identified\nChecklist 5: Product Features And Benefits\nGoal: Explain what the product is and why people will buy and use it\nReference: Chapter 3, Product Features/Benefits Hypothesis\nWhat problem or need are you solving?\nWhat do you think the biggest pain is in how customers work/play?\nIf they could wave a magic wand and change anything what would it\nbe?\nHow does the product solve those problems or needs?\nWhat do people do today to solve their problem?\nProduct Feature List\n10 one- or two-sentence descriptions of product features\nExplain the general goal of the product\nDoes it address a market niche or segment?\nDoes it solve a problem or address a need in a new, different, faster or\ncheaper way?\nProduct Benefits List\nList the benefits through the customer’s eyes\nSomething new?

It includes five components:\ncustomer problems, needs or passions\ncustomer types\ncustomer archetypes\na day in the life of customer\norganizational map and customer influence map\nThe Customer Problem, Need or Passion\nProducts are sold because they solve a problem or fill a need. (See the bank\nteller story in Value Proposition.) Understanding problems and needs\ninvolves understanding their sources. Get out of the building to discover how\ncustomers experience the problem and why (and how much) it matters to\nthem. Understand the organizational impact problem, and the intensity of\npain it causes the company/family/consumer. Use a simple “problem\nrecognition scale” for each important type of customer (Figure 3.2).\nCustomers will express:\na latent problem: they have a problem but don’t know it\na passive problem: they know of the problem but aren’t motivated or\naware of the opportunity to change\nan active (or urgent) problem: they recognize a problem or passion and\nare searching for a solution but haven’t done any serious work to solve\nthe problem\na vision: they have an idea for solving the problem and even have\ncobbled together a home-grown solution, but are prepared to pay for a\nbetter one\nStudy the problem. Is your product solving a mission-critical company\nproblem or satisfying a must-have consumer need? Is your product a musthave or a nice-to-have? When your product solves a problem that costs\ncustomers sleep, revenue, or profits, things are definitely looking up. When\nit’s the hottest “new new thing” in town, whether that town is physical or\nvirtual, capitalize on the opportunity. The best startups discover a situation\nwhere customers have tried to build a solution themselves—they\nsimultaneously discover both a mission-critical problem and a customervisualized solution. Wow. Now simply convince the customer that if they\nbuild it themselves, they’re detouring into a different, usually non-core\nbusiness—your new business!\nThe best startups discover a situation where\ncustomers have tried to build a solution themselves.\nThen again, not every product solves problems. Some provide fun or\ninformation, others glamour or romance. Social networks don’t solve\nproblems but sure have millions of visitors—they fill consumer needs and\ndesires. Even if it’s fun or pure luxury, recognize that consumers require\njustification for a purchase.\nAfter identifying the customer types, craft a hypothesis about their\nemotional wants and desires. Describe how to convince these customers that\nthe product can deliver an emotional payoff: glamour, beauty, wealth,\nprestige, a hot date or lost pounds.\nCustomer Types\nWhether a customer is spending time on a social network, buying a stick of\ngum, or purchasing a million-dollar telecom system, every sale involves a set\nof decision-makers. Thus customer analysis starts with an understanding of\nwhat types of customers to approach. Chances are several people in a number\nof categories have problems that your product can solve or needs or\nambitions that it can satisfy. Customer discovery identifies and probes these\ndifferent needs. Customer types include:\nEnd Users: The day-to-day users of a product push the buttons, touch the\nproduct, use it, love it, and hate it. A deep understanding of their needs and\nmotivations is vital, recognizing that the end user may often have the least\ninfluence in the sales or adoption process. This is typically true in complex\ncorporate sales.\nCustomer Types (Figure 3.2)\nInfluencers: At times, the most powerful pressure on a customer’s buying\ndecisions may not be something the startup did directly but something done\nor said by someone who’s uninvolved. In every market or industry, online\nand off, a select group of individuals pioneers the trends, styles and opinions.\nAsk a famous dress designer when a movie star wears her dress to the Oscars.\nOr consider the effect of thousands of people clicking their Facebook “like”\nbutton or Tweeting about a product, ad or service. Sometimes the influencers\nare paid bloggers or pundits in market-research firms. They may be kids or\ncelebrities who wear the latest fashions. Include the target list of outside\ninfluencers and address how they’ll be reached. Free product, payments,\ncelebrity events, free computers and online memberships are among the many\noptions.\nRecommenders: They influence purchase decisions but differ from\ninfluencers because their opinions can make or break a sale. A recommender\ncould be a widely read blogger raving about a new online game, a department\nhead saying any new PCs should come from Dell, a hospital committee\napproving a new medical device, or a spouse with a particularly strong brand\npreference. It can also be an external force like Gartner Group, Forrester\nResearch, Martha Stewart or Consumer Reports.\nEconomic buyers: They sit further up the decision chain and often control or\napprove the purchase or budget. (Important people to know!) They can be\ncorporate VPs, office managers, insurance companies with issuing\nreimbursement codes, teens with allowances, or spouses with vacation\nbudgets.\nDecision-makers: They may be the economic buyers or reside even higher\nup in the decision-making hierarchy. Decision-makers wield the ultimate\npurchase authority and are sometimes called UDMs (ultimate decisionmakers) or VITOs (very important top officers) or perhaps “Mom,” “Dad” or\n“honey.” Be sure to understand their motivations.\nSaboteurs: They can lurk anywhere (as saboteurs do) and hold titles\nincluding CFO, CIO, child, spouse, or purchasing agent with “friends.” They\ncan be found in strategic planning departments or in your own home, where\ntheir veto can slow things dramatically. Find them. Identify patterns that\nreveal where they’re hiding in the decision process.\nLater, during customer validation, knowing all the players in detail will\nbe essential. For now, simply recognize that the customer is more\ncomplicated than a single individual.\nCustomer Archetypes\nRemember the axiom “A picture is worth a thousand words”? There’s no\nbetter way for the startup team to visualize its customer targets than to take\nthe time to depict each of the key customer types—the end user and the\ndecision-maker at a minimum (at least make a few sketches or doodles).\nCustomer archetypes help the team visualize who will buy or use the product\nand helps crystallize product strategy, customer acquisition, and more.\nCustomer Archetype (Figure 3.3)\nIn a business-to-business sale, does the end user work in an office, a\ncubicle or a boiler room? Is he or she a business traveler, a presenter, or a\nheads-down number cruncher? Is the decision-maker in a corner office, is she\na scientist in a research lab with a wall lined with prestigious degrees and\nawards, or is she on the factory floor?\nTo understand more about customer archetypes and how they’re used,\nreview a detailed discussion in the next section, “Customers/Source—\nWeb/Mobile.” Once you’ve read that, create a comprehensive view of each\nkey customer archetype, using the data you collected.\nConsumer archetypes are generally easier to create than business-tobusiness, where relationships are far more complex. Identify as many\nhypotheses about the buyer’s demographic and psychographic profile as\npossible. Is the buyer affluent, fashion-conscious, healthy and active?\nMarried with pets and toddlers or teens? In a house, an apartment, or a trailer\npark? These characteristics will influence many aspects of the business\nmodel, including customer relationships, channel, and revenue model.\nA Day in the Life of a Customer\nOne of the most powerful ways to understand your customers, whether\nthey’re consumer or business customers, is to discover how they “work” and\nwrite it down, delineating a day in their life.\n...discover how customers “work” and write it\ndown, delineating a day in their life.\nIn the case of businesses, this step requires a deep understanding of a\ntarget company on many levels. Let’s use selling software to a bank as an\nexample. How a bank works isn’t something you’ll discover by cashing a\ncheck. You want to know how the world looks from a banker’s perspective.\nTo begin with, how do the potential end users of the product (the tellers)\nspend their days? What products do they use? How much time do they spend\nusing them? How would life change for these users after they have your\nproduct? Unless you’ve been a bank teller, these questions should leave you\nfeeling somewhat at a loss, but how are you going to sell a product to a bank\nto solve tellers’ problems if you don’t understand how they work?\n(If you’re not an experienced salesperson, this whole notion of getting\nout of the building can sound intimidating. The “Get Out of the Building”\nsection of customer discovery, Chapter 4, describes how to set up your first\nmeetings.)\nNow run this exercise from the perspective of branch managers. How do\nthey spend their day? How would your new product affect them? Run it\nagain, this time thinking about bank presidents. What on earth do they do?\nWhat do they read? Who influences their decisions? How will your product\naffect her? And if you’re installing a product that connects to other software\nthe bank has, you’re going to have deal with the IT organization. How do the\nIT people spend their day? What other software do they run? How are their\nexisting systems configured? Who are their preferred vendors? Are they\nstanding at the door with confetti and Champagne waiting to welcome yet\nanother new company with yet another product?\nThe answers are easy. Asking the right questions is\nhard.\nBusiness products are generally purchased because they solve problems,\nso a deep understanding of the buyer is required. If you’re selling a retailer\npoint-of-sale tools, for example, can someone on your team work behind a\nbusy counter for a few days? There’s no better way to understand than to dive\nin. Learn how prospective users currently solve their problems, online or off,\nand how they’d do it differently using the new product. What will motivate\nthese customers to buy? Draw a vivid and specific picture of a day in the life\nof the customer, and do the research in the same place where they do their\nwork or have their fun, not in the company conference room or alone at a\nlocal Starbucks.\nFinally, back to our banking example, do you know about trends in the\nbanking industry? Is there a banking-industry software consortium? Are there\nbank software trade shows? Industry analysts? Unless you’ve come from\nyour target industry, this part of your customer-problem brief may include\nlittle more than lots of question marks. That’s OK. In customer development,\nthe answers turn out to be easy; it’s asking the right questions that’s difficult.\nYou’ll be going out and talking to customers with the goal of filling in all the\nblank spots on the customer-problem brief.\nFor a consumer product, the same exercise is applicable. How do\nconsumers solve their problems today? How would they solve their problems\nwith your product? Would they be happier? Smarter? Feel better? Do you\nunderstand what will motivate these customers to buy?\nYour final exam doesn’t happen until you come back to the company\nand, in meetings with the product development team and your peers, draw a\nvivid and specific picture of a day in the life of your customer.\nA Sample Organizational/Influence Map (Figure 3.4)\nOrganizational/Influence Maps\nNow having a deeper understanding of a customer’s typical day, you realize\nthat except in rare cases, most customers don’t work by themselves.\nConsumers interact with friends and family, while businesspeople interact\nwith their colleagues. List the people who could influence a customer’s\nbuying decisions and draw a tentative diagram of the prospective customer\nand all the influences surrounding him or her. Also depict the product’s\nimpact on their day-to-day work or personal life. Then build a map showing\npotentially influential people who surround the user. At a large company, the\ndiagram will be complex, with lots of initial unknowns.\nChecklist 6: Customer Segments\nGoal: Develop a hypothesis of who your customers are and what problems\nthey have that will drive them to use your product\nReference: Chapter 3, Customer Segments\nDefine the Customer Problem\nDoes the customer have a latent, passive, active or vision\nproblem/need?\nDefine the Customer type\nDefine the distinctly different types of “customer”\nWho will be the actual day-to-day users of the product?\nWho are the influencers and recommenders?\nWho is the “Economic Buyer”? (i.e. whose budget will pay for it?)\nDo you think the Economic Buyer has an existing budget for this\nproduct or do they need to get one approved?\nWho are the “Decision Makers?”\nWho else needs to approve the purchase?

In another, no human involvement is required, as the product is\noffered and sold online. (If the product itself is bits, it’s both sold and\ndelivered online.)\nPhysical channels have been around for centuries. They’re an\n“intermediate customer” the startup has to deal with, and the barriers can be\nsignificant: high cost, long lead times, lack of control, and lack of promotion,\nto name a few. However, the rewards can be great. In the 20\nth century,\nphysical distribution was especially important. Back then, the pinnacle of\ndistribution was to be sold at Walmart, which welcomes 20 million\nAmericans every day.\nConsider whether your product fits the channel.\nMost companies use both web/mobile and physical channels today. For\nexample, even with some 10,000 massive physical stores, Walmart also\ninvests heavily in walmart.com, an alternate channel, as most national\nretailers do. Most channel strategies, particularly for physical goods, today\ninvolve both physical and web/mobile channels. Whether a company uses a\nphysical or web channel, it must generate customer demand and drive it into\nthe sales channel. Physical and web channels employ very different demandcreation activities.\nConsider Whether Your Product “Fits” the\nChannel\nDifferent sales channels support different product price bands. For example, a\nsalesperson selling enterprise software needs to bring in more than $1.5\nmillion in annual revenue. On the other hand, few Smartphone applications\nsell for more than $10, minus the typical 30 percent app-store fee. Other etailers such as Amazon and bestbuy.com regularly sell products for hundreds\nif not thousands of dollars, sometimes keeping as much as half the gross\nrevenue for themselves.\nBe sure to factor all channel costs into the pricing hypothesis, since\nmany channels charge for distribution, promotion, and even sometimes for\nplacing products on the shelves or returning unsold merchandise to the\ncompany. Channel selection changes the company’s revenue model, often\ndramatically, so be sure to revisit and update the revenue stream hypothesis\nbased on the company’s costs and net revenue when making the channel\nselection. (Always compute the revenue stream on a “net” basis, reflecting\nonly revenue that will arrive in company coffers once the dust settles.)\nPhysical Channel Choices\nEach physical distribution channel has its own unique set of strengths,\nweaknesses and costs. Some channels are “indirect,” with a company selling\nto intermediaries sometimes called “resellers” (distributors, value-added\nresellers, dealers, etc.), who then sell to an end user. For example, when a\nhandheld video-game maker wants to use local independent toy stores as a\nchannel, those toy stores buy merchandise from a local or national distributor.\nYour company calls on the distributor but can’t possibly afford to visit every\nindependent toy store in America. In general, physical distribution is as\ncomplex as it is costly. Here are some of the most common alternatives.\nDirect sales: These are salespeople you employ to either call on end users\n(consumers or businesses) or sell to other resellers.\nStrengths: superb oversight and control; sales force focused on/dedicated\nto your company’s products.\nWeaknesses: Most expensive alternative; hard to find great talent and even\nmore difficult to manage. The product price/margin may not support the\nexpense.\nPhysical Distribution Channel Choices (Figure 3.5)\nIndependent sales-rep firms: Independent salespeople represent multiple\ncompanies to a particular channel or chain, generally on a geographic basis\n(although some rep firms are national). They typically handle compatible but\nnot competing product lines. They often work on commission, less often on\nretainer or a per-sale fee.\nStrengths: Fast way to get national distribution at a variable cost with little\nupfront spending.\nWeaknesses: They’re loyal to their customer, not to you, the selling\ncompany; they’re more of a conduit than a proactive marketer.\nSystems integrators/value-added resellers (VARs): Unlike independent\nsales-rep firms, systems integrators/VARs add value to the products they sell\n(consulting, installation, or integration of additional products from other\nmanufacturers). These organizations sell principally in technology industries\nin business-to-business sales. Systems integrators can be as small as a one- or\ntwo-man local IT consultant or vast global networks like Accenture and IBM.\nStrengths: Fast way to get national distribution and “whole product\nintegration and installation” at a variable cost with no upfront cost to the\ncompany.\nWeaknesses: They’re loyal to their customer, not to you; they are more a\nconduit than a proactive marketer. They require immense care and\nfeeding such as promotional effort, hand-holding, training and incentives\nand as a rule are challenged to organize into a consistent national\nfootprint and harder still to motivate.\nDistributors/Resellers: Mid- and low-volume business and consumer\nproducts are often sold through distributors—intermediaries between\nmanufacturer and retailer who do little more than stock the product locally\nand make it available in modest quantities to local stores. Some distributors\n(think CDW for computers, Arrow for electronic components, McKesson for\npharmaceuticals) are national in scope and carry literally thousands of items.\nIt’s difficult and costly to get a distributor to promote a particular product.\nStrengths: They provide personal attention and can showcase and promote\nproducts they like.\nWeaknesses: Expensive. Generally have an “order taker” mentality and\nare rarely marketing/promotion partners. They may have the rights to\nreturn your product. Typically don’t pay until the product is “sold\nthrough.”\nDealers (aka Retailers): Unlike a distributor, a dealer has bought the\nproduct. Whether they’re selling to businesses or consumers, dealers are\nusually independent retailers or small chains that display and promote what’s\ngenerally a limited selection of products. Typically, they take a large markup\n(often double their cost, called a “keystone”) on the wholesale price to\ncompensate for higher operating costs and smaller volumes. Dealers seldom\ndeal directly with “the factory” (your company), instead buying goods from a\ndistributor or similar intermediary, in more modest quantities than, say,\nCostco. Consumer products are also still sold in “mom-and-pop” food and\nconvenience stores.\nStrengths: They provide personal attention and can showcase and promote\nproducts they like.\nWeaknesses: It’s hard and costly to build a new business using dealers as\nthe principal channel.\nMass merchandisers: In the U.S., national chains from Walmart to Costco\nand Home Depot to 7-Eleven move massive amounts of merchandise to\nconsumers. As a result, they wield enormous influence over manufacturers\nand extract their “pound of flesh” by often charging 50 percent of the retail\nprice for carrying the product. They seldom launch new products without a\nsuccessful “test market” in a modest number of stores. And when that test\nsucceeds, the retailer asks for “slotting allowances” in the tens of thousands\nof dollars (in addition to their markup) for agreeing to display the product.\nStrengths: Massive distribution and advertising/marketing potential.\nWeaknesses: Long lead time to sell into (at times a year or more),\nextremely high cost, little marketing control and less opportunity to\ninfluence. May have the right to return unsold product months later. Pay\npainfully slowly, sometimes taking six months or more.\nOriginal Equipment Manufacturers: OEMs buy a product to make it part\nof their larger product. A PC maker buys hard drives, semiconductors, circuit\nboards and keyboards from scores of manufacturers and assembles those\nproducts into a larger, usually more complex product for sale to end users.\nIssues a startup should consider:\nThe startup’s brand, image and identity are subsumed by the OEM and\noften invisible to the end user. (“Intel inside” is a rare exception where the\ncomponent’s brand and reputation add value); your startup’s success depends\ncompletely on the success of the OEM’s product, not the startup’s; and the\nOEM’s sense of customer needs, issues, and reactions can obscure the\nstartup’s understanding of customer needs.\nStrengths: Massive volume potential.\nWeaknesses: Typically low-margin; no “branding benefit” or visibility for\nyour startup.\nWhich Channel Should I Use?\nA tragic mistake many startups make is to overreach on initial channel\nefforts. Until the company completes customer validation, it should pick a\nsales channel representing the greatest potential and focus on it to the\nexclusion of all others. Your company is still testing and expanding its\nhypotheses and needs to focus on learning. Don’t try to launch a product via\ndirect sales, chain stores and direct mail all at once—it’s almost impossible to\nsucceed at all three. The big exception, of course: physical-channel launches\nwith simultaneous web-marketing (and sometimes sales) support.\nDecisions about channel and pricing are interrelated, so develop the\nchannel hypothesis while working simultaneously on the revenue and pricing\nhypothesis. For example, retail distribution cuts the company’s revenue\ndramatically while direct sales may deliver more sales dollars but do so more\nslowly. When considering which channels to adopt, keep these criteria in\nmind:\nAre there established buying habits/practices in the product category?\nDoes the channel strengthen the sales process? At what cost to the\ncompany?\nWhat are the price and complexity issues surrounding sale of the\nproduct?\nStartups seldom get the channel strategy right the first time. Most\ntechnology startups, for example, assume that a direct sales force is the way\nto go, a hypothesis that’s often proved wrong. It’s almost always smartest—\nand safest—to first observe existing buying patterns and habits for similar\nproducts and product categories, since customers are demonstrating their\npreferred channel by spending their money there.\nChecklist 7: Channels\nGoal: Develop a hypothesis of your distribution channel\nReference: Chapter 3, Physical and Channel Hypotheses\nWhat channel will your users use to buy from you?\nDraw the Distribution Channel Diagram\nHow much will the channel cost (direct expenses or channel discounts)\nAre there indirect channel costs (presales support, promotional\ndollars...)\nWhat else is needed for customers to use/buy the product?\nHow do they acquire those pieces?\nWhat is the net revenue after channel costs?\nIs this a Multi-sided Market?\nHow will you address each side of the market?\nExit criteria:\nDistribution channel selected\nUpdate your business model canvas\nPass/Fail tests identified\nValue Proposition 2: Market-Type and Competitive\nHypothesis\nThe market-type brief describes which of the four market types the company\nfits into. (Refer to Chapter 1, Rule 7, in the Customer Development\nManifesto.) It also adds a competitive brief.\nRegardless of the channel they choose, startups adopt (or pursue) one of\nfour market types. The consequences of choosing the wrong market type are\nsevere (prematurely burning cash on marketing and sales before it’s needed),\nbut unlike decisions about product features, the market-type choice is a “latebinding” decision. While a final decision can be deferred until customer\ncreation, it’s wise to develop and test an initial market-type hypothesis while\nmoving through the customer discovery phase. In the next chapters, we’ll\ncome back to the market type selection process many times, and refine and\ndeepen the analysis after further discussing customers and market.\nIn this brief, seek a provisional answer to just one question: is the\ncompany entering an existing market, re-segmenting an existing market,\ncreating a new market or cloning a market?\nMarket type drives marketing spending, sales\ntiming and cash need.\nMarket Type\nFor some startups, the market-type choice is pretty clear. When entering a\nmarket that has a ton of competitors, whether it’s smartphones, social\nnetworks, glucose meters or airplanes, the choice has already been made for\nyou: it’s an existing market. On the other hand, if your company invents a\nnew class of product no one has ever seen before, it’s most likely in a new\nmarket. However, most companies have the luxury of choosing which market\ntype to use. So how to make the decision? A few simple questions begin the\nprocess:\nIs there an established, well-defined market with large numbers of\ncustomers? Do customers know the name of the market and do\ncompetitors exist? Does the product have an edge (better performance,\nfeatures, service) over competitors? If so, it’s an existing market\nWould some part of an existing market buy a product designed to\naddress its specific needs? Even if it cost more? Or even if it had worse\nperformance in an aspect of the product irrelevant to this niche? If so,\nthink re-segmented market/niche strategy\nAnother type of re-segmentation answers the question: Are there\ncustomers at the low end of an existing market who will buy “good\nenough” performance if they can get it at a substantially lower price? If\nyes, think re-segmented market/low-cost strategy\nWithout an established and well-defined market, there are obviously no\nexisting customers or competitors and a new market is being created\nStartups in Russia, India, Indonesia, Brazil, Japan and China (where\nthey have large local markets and language and cultural barriers) have\nan additional market type: the clone market. Can you adopt/borrow/copy\nan already-successful business model and company from the U.S. and\nadapt it to local language and buying preferences. (Not too long from\nnow, ideas from those countries will be cloned in the U.S.)\nWhen you talk to customers, they’ll have lots of opinions about where\nthe product fits. Don’t worry about wavering among the market-type choices.\nFor now, just look at each market type and pick the one that best fits the\ncompany’s vision today. Table 3.1 summarizes of the trade-offs.\nMarket Type Trade-Offs (Table 3.1)\nOne of the best tools for sorting out existing market entry strategies is\nderived from military operations research. It suggests a few simple rules that\ncompanies can use to analyze an existing market:\nIf a single company has 74 percent of the market, the market has\nbecome an effective monopoly. For a startup, that’s an unassailable\nposition for a head-on assault. (Think Google in search or Facebook in\nsocial networks.)\nIf the combined market share for the market leader and the secondranking company is greater than 74 percent and the first company is\nwithin 1.7 times the share of the second, it means a duopoly commands\nthe market. Its position is impervious to attack by a startup. (In the\ntelecom sector, Cisco’s and Juniper’s combined share of the core router\nmarket fits this description.)\nIf a company has 41 percent market share and at least 1.7 times the\nmarket share of the next-largest company, it’s the market leader.\nFor a startup, this too is a very difficult market to enter. Markets with a\nclear market leader offer an opportunity for re-segementation.\nIf the biggest player in a market has at least a 26 percent market share,\nthe market is unstable, with a strong possibility of abrupt shifts in the\ncompany rankings. Here there may be some existing market entry\nopportunities.\nIf the biggest player has less than 26 percent market share, it has no real\ninfluence on the market. Startups that want to enter an existing market\nfind these the easiest to penetrate.\nIf you decide to attack a market that has just one dominant player, you\nneed to be prepared to spend three times the combined sales and marketing\nbudget of that dominant player. (Ouch—so much for going head-on with\nGoogle or Facebook.)\nIn a market that has multiple participants, the cost of entry is lower, but\nyou still need to spend 1.7 times the combined sales and marketing budget of\nthe company you plan to attack. (To enter an existing market, you must steal\nmarket share from an incumbent, hence the war analogy.) Table 3.2\nsummarizes the existing market cost of entry.\nMarket Type—Cost of Entry (Table 3.2)\nCompetition in an Existing Market\nNow that you understand the type of market you’re in, the competitive\nlandscape becomes clearer. If you believe your company and product fit into\nan existing market, you need to understand how your product outperforms\nyour competitors’. In an existing market the customers can tell you what the\nbasis of competition is. It nearly always has to do with key product attributes,\nbut sometimes it’s other components of the business model—e.g., channel or\nprice. Strive for a product or feature or improvement that can get a customer\nto say, “I’ll pay anything for that.”\nPositioning the product against the slew of existing competitors is\naccomplished by adroitly selecting the basis of competition where you can\nwin. Remember it’s not always features. It can be convenience, services,\nbrand, etc., where the new entry is clearly better. Summarize the thinking in a\nbrief. When entering an existing market, good questions to address in the\nbrief include:\nWho are the incumbents and which ones drive the market?\nWhat is the market share of each competitor?\nHow many marketing and sales dollars will the market leaders spend to\ncompete?\nWhat will the cost of entry be against incumbent competitors?\nWhat performance attributes have customers said are important? How\ndo competitors define performance?\nWhat share of this market does the company want to capture in the first\nthree years?\nHow do the competitors define the market?\nAre there existing standards? If so, whose agenda is driving the\nstandards?\nDoes the company seek to embrace these standards, extend them, or\nreplace them? (If the answer is to extend or replace them, this may\nindicate a re-segmented market.) When you enter an existing market,\nthough, also fill out the competitive brief discussed later in this section\nto shape the positioning further\nOne way to plan your attack in an existing market is to refer to your\nbusiness model canvas. What jobs are your customers asking your product to\nfill? What problem is your value proposition solving?\nRe-segmenting an Existing Market\nIn an existing market, your startup is the weakest player with the least\nresources. Therefore, attacking the strongest players head-on is foolish. You\nwant to choose strategies that acknowledge your weaknesses and play to your\nagility. If there’s a dominant player with more than 74 percent market share,\ndon’t attack that market head-on. Why? Because you need three times the\nresources of the market leader. Instead, target your attack at the point where\nyour limited resources can make a difference. You’ll segment the existing\nmarket to create a submarket where your product can be unique or\nsubstantially different. Or if you can create a new market, you can define a\nspace the market leader doesn’t address at all.\nIf your enemy is superior in strength, evade him. If\nangry irritate him. Pretend to be weak, that he may\ngrow arrogant.\nIf the dominant player has between 26 percent and 74 percent market\nshare, pick your battles carefully. Remember the cost of a head-on attack:\nthree times the budget of a single competitor or 1.7 times that of a competitor\nin a crowded market.\nMost startups don’t have access to those financial resources. Therefore,\nre-segmenting the market or creating a new market is almost always the\ndefault when faced with a dominant incumbent. All the marketing tricks for\nnipping at the heels of an entrenched competitor can be used here. Most of\nthem were invented 2,500 years ago by Sun Tzu and described in his book\nThe Art of War. Paraphrasing about: “All warfare is based on deception. If\nyour enemy is superior evade him. If angry irritate him. If equally matched,\nfight, and if not, re-evaluate”.\nYour goal is to become No. 1 in something important to your customer.\nIt could be product attribute, territory, distribution chain/retailer, or customer\nbase. Keep segmenting the market (by age, income, region, etc.) and focusing\non the competitors’ weak points until you have a battle you can win.\nRemember, any company can take customers away from any other company\n—if it can define the battle. When re-segmenting an existing market,\npositioning rests on either:\n(a) finding a unique niche where some product feature or service\nredefines the market, creating a clear competitive advantage\n(b) being the “low-cost provider” or\n(c) combining differentiation and lower operating cost into a Blue Ocean\nStrategy that creates an uncontested market space and makes the\ncompetition irrelevant while creating and capturing new demand.\nSouthwest Airlines was among the first to re-segment air travel this\nway, followed by many copycat failures and much later by JetBlue.\nCirque du Soleil is an example of a Blue Ocean re-segmentation,\noffering product differentiation as well as lower operating costs\nIn an existing market, your startup is the weakest\nplayer with the least resources.\nWhen re-segmenting for a unique niche, address these questions in this brief:\nWhat existing markets are customers coming from?\nWhat are the unique characteristics of those customers?\nWhat compelling needs of those customers are unmet by existing\nsuppliers?\nWhat compelling product features will get customers to abandon their\ncurrent suppliers?\nWhy couldn’t existing companies offer the same thing?\nHow long will it take you to grow a market of sufficient size? What\nsize?\nHow will the company educate the market and create demand?\nGiven that no customers yet exist in the new segment, what are realistic\nsales forecasts?\nHow can this forecast be tested?\nCan parts of the business model be changed to differentiate the\ncompany?\nFor this type of startup, draw a “market map” (a diagram of how this\nnew market will look) as shown in Figure 3.6, to illustrate why the company\nis unique. Draw the market map with the startup in the center. A resegmented market assumes that customers flow from an existing market(s).\nDraw the existing markets that customers should flow from (remember that a\nmarket is a set of companies with common attributes). Draw the product\nfeatures and functions that, when assembled, best describe the new product\n(think Hershey bar, now with peanut butter and zero calories—each attribute\ndraws different customer groups).\nExample of a Market Map (Figure 3.6)\nWhen re-segmenting based on low cost, questions to address include:\nWhat existing markets are customers coming from?\nWhat are the unique characteristics of those customers?\nWhat price will it take (known as “switching cost”) to get those\ncustomers to spend time online with or buy from the new company?\nWhat features are customers willing to give up to get the lower price?\nHow can this hypothesis be tested quantitatively?\nFinally, visualize why thousands of new customers will believe in and\nmove to this market. And beware the “low-price provider” re-segmentation,\nsince competitors can reprice in a matter of days if not hours, eviscerating the\npositioning that everyone just bet the new business on.\nWhat could be better than a market with no\ncompetitors?\nEntering a New Market\nWhat if there are no competitors? What if, after talking to all your early\ncustomers, you continue to hear, “There’s nothing else like what your\ncompany is offering”? What if, after looking at all the quantitative data, you\ncan’t find other companies with comparable products? Congratulations—\nyou’re creating a new market. At first glance, a new market has great appeal.\nA standing joke is that every new market has its own descriptive TLA (threeletter acronym). What could be better than a market with no competitors?\nAnd absence of competition typically means that pricing isn’t a competitive\nissue but an issue of what the market will bear. Wow, no competitors and\nhigh margins!\nA company creating a new market is a radically different type of\ncompany from one entering or reframing an existing market. While there are\nno market-share battles with competitors, there are also no existing\ncustomers. If there are no existing customers, even an infinite demandcreation budget at the point of product launch won’t garner market share.\nCreating a new market is about long-term customer education and adoption.\nNew-market entries are by far the most expensive demand-creation\nchallenges, particularly since the marketer can’t say “tastier than Yummies”\nor “faster than Porsche” or “cheaper than Brand X,” since no such\ncomparables exist. At the risk of sounding pedantic, creating a new market\nmeans a market doesn’t currently exist—there are no customers. When\nentering a new market, good questions to address include:\nWhat are the markets adjacent to the new one being created?\nWhat markets will potential customers come from?\nWhat’s the company’s vision and why will lots of people care?\nWhat “never could have been done before” will make customers\nuse/buy?\nHow long will it take to educate potential customers to grow a market of\nsufficient size? What size is that?\nHow will the company educate the market? How will it create demand?\nGiven that no customers yet exist, what are realistic sales forecasts for\nthe first three years?\nHow much financing will it take to soldier on while educating and\ngrowing the market?\nWhat will stop a well-heeled competitor from taking over the market\nonce the startup develops it? (This phenomenon is the source of the\nphrase “Pioneers are the ones with arrows in their backs.”)\nIs the product better-defined as one that will re-segment a market or\nenter an existing one?\nNew-market entries are by far the most expensive...\nCompanies compete in new markets not by besting other companies\nwith product features but by convincing a set of customers that the new\ncompany’s market vision is real and solves a real problem a different way. A\nfew classic examples: Snapple, Toyota Prius, Siebel, Groupon, and\nFacebook. However, who the users are, and the definition of the market itself\nare both clearly unknown. This brief defines the new market and its users\nwith the startup at the center.\nOne last thing to consider: startups creating new markets won’t create a\nmarket of sufficient size to generate a profit until three to seven years from\nproduct launch. This sobering piece of data is derived from looking at the\nresults of hundreds of high-tech startups of the last twenty years. While you\nmay be convinced your startup is the exception, the odds say that unless\nyou’re in a “bubble economy,” it takes time for new ideas and products to\ndiffuse and catch on. (A bubble economy is defined as a time of irrational\nexuberance in a market when all normal rules are repealed.)\nMarket type, in summary: Market type is one of the most important choices\nfounders need to make and agree on with investors, since it drives spending,\ntiming and competitive analysis. The choice doesn’t need to be made during\ncustomer discovery, but an initial hypothesis is needed. If investors are\nexpecting substantial revenue in Year One, thinking they’ve invested in an\nexisting-market company, the outcome is typically a new CEO. Market type\nselection drives spending and budget as well as revenue expectations.\nCompetitive Brief\nOnce you understand your market type, it’s relatively simple to assemble a\ncompetitive brief. This will help you understand how you’ll compete in the\nmarket.\nWhen entering an existing market or re-segmenting one, your first\ninstinct may be that the basis of competition is simply the product features of\nyour value proposition. That may be, but you may be missing a bigger\ncompetitive advantage. Is there something about partners, the channel,\nresources, etc. that would be a game changer? Think of Apple and the\noriginal iPod. It combined a hardware player, which lots of vendors had, with\nan easy-to-use software application, iTunes, which no one had (but others\ncould have built) and then added partners at the record labels (which required\nSteve Jobs’ reality-distortion field). The business model canvas is a perfect\nvehicle for brainstorming some of these ideas.\nIn a new market, it’s tempting to say,\n“We have no\ncompetition.” But you’ll be wrong.\nExplain how and why your new product is better than its competitors.\nOther items the competitive brief should consider:\nHow have existing competitors defined the basis of competition? Is it in\nterms of product attributes? Service? What are their claims? Features?\nWhat makes the new company and its product stand out as dramatically\ndifferent? Features? Performance? Price?\nWill customers care if the new product lets them do something they\ncouldn’t do before?\nIn a retail store, which competitive products will be shelved next to the\nnew entry?\nFor web/mobile apps, assess competitors’ product quality, features, sales\nor user data, and traffic levels.\nWhat’s strongest about each competitor’s product? What do current\ncustomers like most about those existing products? What would\ncustomers change about them?\nWhat is a customer’s “reason to buy” or use the product, app, or site?\nAnd which competitors will they abandon to do so, and why?\nIf you’re in a new market, it’s tempting to say, “We have no\ncompetition.” But you’ll be wrong. The new product itself may not yet exist,\nbut what do people do today without it? Do they simply not do something, or\ndo it badly or inefficiently? What will your new product enable them to do\nthat they couldn’t do before. Why will they care?\nIt’s only natural that startups compare themselves with other startups\naround them, but it’s important to remember a key tenet of Customer\nDevelopment: Don’t make a list of all competitors’ features to simply make a\nbigger list. A few incremental features or improvements seldom result in a\ngreat, scalable company. What’s more, in their first few years, startups\nseldom put one another out of business.\nWinners understand why customers buy.\nWhile startups compete for funding and technical resources, winners\nunderstand why customers buy. The losers never do. Competitive analysis\nstarts at why customers will buy and then looks at the whole market,\nincluding new and established competitors.\nChecklist 8: Market Type\nGoal: Select an initial Market Type\nReference: Chapter 3, Market Type\nDo you have a new product in an existing market?\nDo you want to clone an existing market?\nDo you need to redefine/reframe a market?\nOr do you want to create an entirely new market?\nIs your product/service a substitute for something customers already\nhave?\nIs it a replacement?\nIs it a variant on something already out there, but can be “respun” into\nsomething new?\nIs it something totally new?\nPositioning in An Existing Market\nDefine the basis of competition\nWho is driving the existing market?\nDo you have some advantage or appeal among any vertical or\nhorizontal market segment?\nPositioning in An Existing Market you Want to Resegment\nDefine the basis of the how you want to change the market\nWho is driving the existing market you want to resegment?\nPositioning in a New Market\nHow will you create the market\nEstimate of market creation costs\nExit criteria:\nA preliminary first hypothesis of the type of market\nUpdate your business model canvas\nPass/Fail tests identified\nPROCEED WITH CAUTION:\nThis is not the time to broadly launch your product to a wide audience or\nget a ton of press. (You’ll be under enormous peer pressure to do so.)\nCustomer Relationships Hypothesis\nThis customer-relationship brief describes how you get customers into your\nsales channel, keep them as customers and grow additional revenue from\nthem over time.\nThe “Get, Keep, Grow” Funnel in Physical Channels (Figure 3.7)\nWhile Figure 3.7 illustrates the flow through the process, Table 3.3\nprovides an overview of the most widely used activities, by channel, for each\nstep in the “get, keep, grow” process. In this hypothesis we’ll focus on the\ncolumn on the left: the physical channel.\nEvery company, whether its product or channel is physical or\nweb/mobile, can summarize its mission in three succinct phrases: build great\nproducts; “get, keep, and grow” customers; and make money directly or\nindirectly from these customers. Customer relationships are the strategies and\ntactics to get, keep and grow customers.\nGetting customers, sometimes called demand creation, drives customers\ninto your chosen sales channel(s).\nKeeping customers, or retention, gives customers reasons to stick with\nthe company and product.\nGrowing customers involves selling them more of what they’ve bought\nas well as new and different products and encourages them to refer new\ncustomers.\n“Get, Keep and Grow” are among the most\nimportant hypotheses for any startup.\n“Get, keep and grow” are among the most important hypotheses for any\nstartup. You will die without customers and these are most expensive parts of\nany company. The diagram in Figure 3.7 provides an overview of the entire\ncustomer relationship life cycle. This hypothesis will “dissect” the diagram,\nstarting on the left from “awareness,” the first step, and proceeding through\neach of the many steps in the “get, keep, grow” process.\nPROCEED WITH CAUTION: There is no way you can implement all\nthis or even process it in one sitting. What follows is an overview of all\nthe things you need to consider as you shape a marketing strategy that’s\nbest for your startup.\nDeveloping Customer Relationships in the Physical\nChannel\nCustomer Relationship Tools for Physical Channels (Table 3.3)\nThink of the “get customers” process as a “funnel” in which the greatest\nnumber of potential customers—those on the left—have awareness of the\nproduct. The number of potential customers declines as their interest grows,\nas they consider buying, and then as they make the actual purchase. During\ncustomer discovery, you’ll launch a series of small-scale, inexpensive “get\ncustomers” experiments to determine the tactics that move customers into and\nthrough the funnel in a repeatable, scalable, and cost-effective way. Later,\nonce you have customers, you’ll begin customer retention activities to keep\nthe customers and use upselling, cross-selling and customer referral programs\nto grow the number of customers and the revenue.\n“Get Customers”\nGetting customers, or demand creation, has four distinct stages in the\nphysical channel: awareness, interest, consideration, and purchase. See\nFigure 3.8.\nThe “Get Customers” Funnel for Physical Goods (Figure 3.8)\nPROCEED WITH CAUTION: There is no way you can implement all\nthese alternatives at once or even process them in one sitting. What\nfollows is an overview of all the things you need to consider as you\nshape a marketing strategy that’s best for you.\nAwareness lets potential customers know about your product or service\n(think TV commercials shouting “new airline” or radio ads saying, “Now you\ncan fly cheaper”). It gets people thinking about the product or service.\nInterest means the message is no longer being ignored even if the\nprospect isn’t ready to act. Think of people saying, “I should try one of those\nlow-cost airlines sometime,” as a result of the initial awareness effort. One\nmore push could move this prospect to the consideration step.\nConsideration follows interest when the message is powerful enough or\ncontains a convincing offer that might lead to the thought, “Why don’t I take\nJetBlue on my trip to Florida next month?” Consideration may take the form\nof a free trial where it’s offered.\nPurchase follows consideration. It’s clearly the desired result of “get”\nactivities.\nCreating demand for a consumer electronics product sold on Walmart’s\nshelves is different from opening a chain of pizza parlors or selling a new\ntype of semiconductor. And while the description of customer relationship\nactivities may seem simple at first, it’s actually the result of a complex\ninterplay among customers, the sales channel, the value proposition and the\nbudget for marketing activities. When you get it right, it all comes together in\na repeatable, scalable, profitable business model.\nDevelop Your “Get Customers” Strategy\nEarned and Paid Media Feeding the “Get Customers” Funnel\n(Figure 3.9)\nThe first three funnel stages—awareness, interest, and consideration—happen\nin the consumer’s mind, out of reach of anything other than your advertising\nmessages. The first two stages—awareness and interest—are out of your\ncontrol until the customer identifies herself or himself to some channel like a\nretailer, a direct-sales rep, or a website and says, “I’m interested.” (This could\nhappen when the customer leaves a business card at a trade show, requests\nmore information online, or talks with a company representative.) The “get\ncustomers” activity moves customers as far into the funnel as possible until\nthe customer self-identifies and the channel takes over the “consideration”\nand “purchase” activity. But it all starts with awareness.\n“Get Customers” Tools for Physical Channels (Table 3.3a)\nAn important caution: be aware of the way the physical-channel has\nchanged in the past decade. Whether a product is sold at a car dealership, a\ngravel pit, a 7-Eleven or the trendiest retail boutique, 21st-century consumers\nbegin their search for products online. So online marketing is every bit as\nimportant to marketers in the physical channel as it is to their web\ncounterparts. Your job as a marketer is to be sure customers can easily find\nyour product or service on the web. This means that physical-channel\nmarketers need to pay almost as much attention to the next section of this\nchapter—“Web/Mobile Customer Relationships”—as they pay to this one.\n(For best results, read both sections before beginning the tasks outlined\nhere.) Marketers in the physical channel must embrace basic web-marketing\ntactics at every opportunity—websites, AdWords, online advertising—even\nin the unlikely event that your product isn’t for sale online. Online, your job\nis to “pull” customers to your product so they can discover it online, even if\nthey then buy it at your warehouse, at Walmart or face-to-face from a sales\nrepresentative.\nAwareness, interest, and consideration in the physical channel are\nprimarily driven by two types of communication tactics: earned (or free)\nmedia and paid media.\nEarned media is the free exposure a company generates. In the physical\nchannel, it includes press releases, product reviews, editorial features and a\nrange of “guerrilla marketing” tactics such as handing out fliers at trade\nshows where the company doesn’t buy a booth. These tactics are often\nfavored by startups because they’re far less expensive than paid media\nefforts. Many consumer products find their first customers through free\nsample or trial programs or by handing out samples or discount coupons on\nstreet corners.\nThe downside of earned media: unlike paid media, which run on specific\ndates and locations, editorial coverage is unpredictable and runs—or doesn’t\n—as editorial space or the product’s news value allow.\nOnline marketing is every bit as important to\nmarketers in the physical channel as it is to their\nweb counterparts.\nPaid media is exactly what it sounds like: media exposure that’s\npurchased on TV, blimps, direct mail or the web. This kind of activity can\ncost literally millions of dollars when rolled out, so customer discovery\nemploys small-scale tests to see which tactic will deliver the best results later,\nat product launch.\nOther paid-media awareness-creation tactics that aren’t free include\nadvertising, trade shows, direct mail, catalogs, events, telemarketing, and instore promotion. Most physical-channel marketers also promote their\nproducts online, of course. During customer discovery your spending will be\nlow until you successfully test a tactic and prove that it generates leads and\nsales cost-effectively.\nSimple “Get Customer” Tactics to Consider\nBuild a “get customers”-hypothesis spending spreadsheet that lists:\nthe free and paid media programs\nwhat the company hopes to achieve and at what cost\nBefore conducting these or any other tests of customer-relationship\ntactics:\n1. Create a “pass/fail” metric for each “Get” test that defines whether it\nworked and should be expanded. An example: will we get one sales\ncall for every 30 phone calls made to prospects?\n2. Consider a methodology for improving the results of each test, such as:\nIf the call blitz doesn’t work, we will e-mail first and then call each\nprospect twice.\n3. Be sure the tests are objectively measurable so that the big spending\ndecisions that follow aren’t made based on the fact that “it felt good”\nor “seems to work well.” JetBlue’s metric for radio ads might seek to\ngenerate reservations-hotline calls at a cost of $1 each. The logic: they\ncan spend $3 on marketing (sometimes called customer acquisition\ncost) to sell a round-trip ticket, and one caller in three buys a ticket on\naverage.\n4. Don’t forget that people buy from people. Create, don’t avoid,\nopportunities to talk via phone or in person with potential customers.\nThere are few more powerful sales tools!\nMost companies selling through the physical\nchannel will use a variety of web/mobile marketing\ntactics...\n5. Remember that most companies selling through the physical channel\nstill use a variety of web/mobile marketing tactics to gain awareness\nand sales for their products, so be sure to include elements of\nweb/mobile “Get” programs from the next section.\nThe sample spreadsheet in Figure 3.10 charts the costs and expected\nresults of the “get” efforts for a startup’s new heavy-duty, $2,500 printer sold\nto businesses through office-products stores. The spreadsheet is used to be\nsure the program tests are affordable.\nSample Customer Relationship Program Spreadsheet\nEarned Media\nPaid media\nProgram goals 50 sales plus 60 inquiries, 10% of the inquiries convert\nTotal 56 sales, 54 prospects\nTotal cost/sale = $140.00 (8700/56) vs. profit/sale of $300.00\n√ This is a good test\nSample Customer Relationship “Tactics to Test” Hypothesis with\nReturn on Investment Analysis (Figure 3.10)\n“Keep Customers”\nAs the “Get” customers exercise clearly illustrates, getting a new customer is\nan expensive process. Thus it’s important to think now about how the\ncompany will keep, or retain, customers it’s worked so hard to get. When\ncustomers cancel a subscription, never return to a supermarket, or close a\ncorporate purchasing account, it’s called “churn” or “attrition” (the opposite\nof retention!).\nThe “Keep Customers” Funnel (Figure 3.11)\nDevelop Your “Keep Customers” Strategy\n“Keep Customers” Tools for Physical Channels (Table 3.3b)\nFor any customer retention strategy to work, first the company must\ndeliver on all its promises that got the customers to buy in the first place.\nCustomers need to love the product or service, and every customer-facing\naspect of the business model has to perform exceptionally, from customer\nservice and support to complaint-handling, delivery, billing, and more. First,\na steady stream of product upgrades and enhancements should always keep\nthe product ahead of competition. By their nature, these are core-valuecreation activities and should be addressed in the value proposition\nhypothesis.\nNext, begin to think about programs that reach out to customers\nproactively to strengthen or bolster retention. This can be as simple as placing\n(often quite powerful) outbound calls to be sure customers are happy or as\ncomplex as a multi-tiered loyalty-points program to reward repeat purchases.\nIn a startup’s early days, it’s hard to test the impact of loyalty programs, since\nthe results need to be measured over long periods of time.\nIn a startup’s early days, it’s hard to test the impact\nof loyalty programs...\nIn addition, consider loyalty programs such as points, rewards and\ndiscounts as well as long-term retention incentives like multi-year contracts.\nMake them part of the hypothesis, and test them where possible during\ncustomer validation.\nFinally, consider other parts of the business model canvas. Are there\nthings your partners can do to help you keep customers? Other resources you\ncan use?\nSimple “Keep Customers” Tactics to Consider: During customer\ndiscovery, put together plans and then test some basic, inexpensive “Keep”\nactivities to see how they perform. Use the test results to guide future plans in\ncustomer validation and creation. Some simple programs to test and consider:\nLoyalty programs: How you will use loyalty programs to retain\ncustomers.\nCustomer check-in calls: Put together a plan to call every customer, or\nevery fifth customer, once a month or once a quarter simply to thank\nthem for their business and see how they like the product. While you\nhave them on the phone, probe for questions they have about the\nproduct, features or functions. (By the way, e-mail is still a poor\nsubstitute for a voice or Skype connection.) Over time, target at least a\n15 percent improvement in repeat sales or renewals from customers\nwho’ve talked.\nLaunch a customer-satisfaction survey: Whether on the web or by mail\nor e-mail, plan to check with customers about their use of and\nsatisfaction with the product or service. (Probe for complaints or lack of\nuse, and reach out to any who express problems. Look for at least a 15\npercent reduction in churn from those who’ve been contacted.)\nSend product-update bulletins: Create simple tip sheets or user notes on\nhow customers are making the most of the product. (Send them to all\nusers, and offer a prize for users whose tips are published later. This is\ndifficult to measure precisely but inexpensive to implement.)\nMonitor customer-service issues: Customers who complain frequently\nare most likely to churn. (Get proactive with these customers, fix their\nproblems, and make them happy. Far fewer complainers should leave if\nthey’ve had their problems addressed.)\nCustomer lock-in/high switching costs: If it’s relatively easy for your\ncustomer to switch from your products to your competitors’, you’ll\nprobably have a higher churn rate. You may want to consider tactics for\n“locking in” customers to your product or solution (through long-term\ncontracts, unique technology, or data that can’t be easily transferred).\nIt’s 5-10x cheaper to keep a customer than to\nacquire one.\nLonger-Term Customer Retention: Customer retention is effective only\nwhen the customers self-identify so they can be contacted by the salesperson,\nchannel partner, or company representative charged with keeping them happy\nand coming back to buy more. As you learn more about individual customers\nover time, retention becomes increasingly individualized and targeted based\non the observed and measured customer behavior. This subject is more fully\naddressed during customer validation, when there are more customers to\nthink about keeping.\nSpecific retention metrics to monitor and act on include:\npurchase patterns: volume, frequency, slowdowns or halts\nparticipation in “grow customers” programs (described in the next\nsection)\nnumber of complaints to customer service, refund requests, problems,\nand the like\nparticipation, activity levels, redemptions in loyalty and incentive\nprograms\nRetention programs live or die by a close monitoring of customer\nbehavior to learn who’s staying and who’s leaving and why. You’ll organize\nthe metrics around “cohorts,” or common groups of customers (such as “new\ncustomers signed in January”). Three-month customers, for example, may\nbehave one way while nine-month customers may be more or less active than\ntheir newer brethren.\n“Grow Customers”\nOnce a company has a customer, why not sell them more, since it costs less\nthan acquiring new customers? Most startups think only about the revenue\nthey receive in their first sale to a customer, but smart companies think about\nthe revenue they can get over the lifetime of the relationship they have with a\ncustomer. Measuring customer lifetime value can be important when\ncomputing a startup’s potential. Describe how the company will get more\nrevenue from its existing customer base with programs that sell more and\nencourage customers to refer new ones to the company.\nThe “Grow Customers” Funnel (Figure 3.12)\nDevelop a “Grow Customers” Strategy\n“Grow Customers” Tools for Physical Channels (Table 3.3c)\nYour “Grow” strategy will have two key components: get the customers you\nhave to buy more, and get them to refer other customers to you. A few\n“Grow” tactics only work in the physical channel, such as:\n“Upsell” offers such as “spend $25 more and get free shipping”\nIn-pack promotional mailers of offers, coupons, and samples\nSpecials or premiums only available to customers who meet with a sales\nrep\nDirect mail is also an effective customer growth tool, of course.\nIncreasingly, however, physical channel marketers are turning to online\nmarketing rather than postal mail because of its speed, lower cost, and the\nability to target better. You should also study the discussion of “Grow”\nstrategy and tactics in the web/mobile section for many more ideas. This will\nhelp you shape your initial programs to grow your customer base through\nadditional sales and referrals.\nIt’s difficult at this time to think through and test extensive “Grow”\ncustomers programs because you have very few customers to test them with.\nFar more detail is provided in the customer validation step, when there are\nenough customers aboard your “Grow” programs.\nChecklist 9: Customer Relationships\nGoal: How you will “Get, Keep and Grow Customers” in a physical channel\nReference: Chapter 3, Customer Relationships\nDraw Your “Get/Keep/Grow” Funnel\nDescribe your “Get Customers” Strategy\nAwareness\nInterest\nConsideration\nPurchase\nWhat are your “Get Customers” Tactics?\nEarned Media?\nPaid Media?\nDescribe your “Keep Customers” Strategy\nInteract\nRetain\nWhat are your “Keep Customers” Tactics?\nLoyalty programs?\nProduct updates?\nCustomer Surveys?\nDescribe your “Grow Customers” Strategy\nNew Revenue from existing customers\nCustomer referrals\nWhat are your “Grow Customers” Tactics?\\Up-sell/Cross-sell/other\ntactics\nReferral generation programs to test\nExit criteria:\nA preliminary first hypothesis of all Get/Keep Grow activities\nUpdate your business model canvas\nPass/Fail tests identified\nNote to reader: Although tailored to web/mobile startups, the following pages\ninclude tips and guidelines that physical startups will find useful.\nCustomer Relationships Hypothesis\nThis customer relationships brief describes how you get customers to\nyour website or mobile app, keep them as customers and grow additional\nrevenue from them over time.\nThe “Get, Keep and Grow” Customers Funnel in Web/Mobile\n(Figure 3.13)\nPROCEED WITH CAUTION: This is not the time to broadly launch\nyour site or app to a wide audience. You are writing the briefs here, not\nimplementing tactics with your MVP!\nReview the previous section on customer relationships for physical\nproducts before starting this one. The web/mobile customer funnel in Figure\n3.13 is quite different from its physical counterpart in Figure 3.7. Getting\ncustomers here is simpler, having only two steps. It also includes a “viral\nloop” where early customers invite friends and colleagues to explore the new\nproduct. Finally, not visible in the diagram is the fact that web/mobile\nstartups can test tactics faster, market less expensively, and reach out to far\nmore customers than companies in the physical channel.\nThe test of “Get, Keep and Grow” activities during customer discovery\nis small-scale, exposing the “rough and dirty,” or low-fidelity, minimum\nviable product to a modest number of customers, perhaps a few hundred or\nso, to gauge their reaction to the business model (including value proposition,\nprice, and product features.) Discovery explores which tactics work and\ngauges initial reactions to the MVP.\nCustomer Relationship for Web/Mobile Channels (Table 3.4)\nThe right-hand column of Table 3.4 provides an overview of\nweb/mobile “Get, Keep and Grow” strategies and tactics. It focuses first on\ngetting customers, since the company first has to have customers before it can\nwork to keep them, sell them a second time, or grow them.\nMany web/mobile products operate as multi-sided markets; Google and\nFacebook are canonical examples. Consumers use the product at no cost.\nAdvertisers pay the company to reach those customers with ads, AdWords,\ntextlinks and other marketing messages. That revenue is why Google can\nafford to build massive data centers and offer search for “Free.”\nMulti-sided marketers need two separate, parallel “Get” approaches—\none for the users and another for the payers, since the value proposition for\neach is quite different. Almost universally, multi-sided marketers focus first\non efforts to get users. A company that has aggregated an audience of many\nmillions can almost certainly find marketers eager to pay for the privilege of\ncommunicating with that audience.\nGetting Customers: Acquisition and Activation\nDevelop the company’s hypothesis about how it will “Get” customers.\nThere are a million-plus apps for sale on mobile app stores and an\ninfinite number of commerce, social and content websites, so the mere fact\nthat you’ve launched a new one doesn’t make it a successful business.\nBuilding your product is the easy part. The hard part is getting customers to\nfind your app, site or product. It’s a daunting, never-ending challenge to build\ncustomer relationships, quite literally, one customer at a time.\nThe “Get Customers” Funnel in Web/Mobile Channels (Figure 3.14)\nBuilding your product is easy. The hard part is\nGetting Customers.\nAcquisition vs. Activation: What’s the Difference?\nLet’s get started with the first two steps for “getting” customers: acquisition\nand activation.\n“Get Customers” Tools for Web/Mobile Channels (Table 3.4a)\nCustomer Acquisition: The acquisition phase equates to the “awareness,”\n“interest,” and “consideration” steps in the physical channel, where\ncustomers learn about and explore a product before they buy. In web/mobile\napps, the “Get” effort focuses on bringing as many customers as possible to\nthe company’s online “front door”—the landing page. There, they’re\nintroduced to the product and hopefully buy it or use it. Since the number of\npeople who come to a landing page and look but don’t buy or use is often\nvery high, web/mobile “Get” plans must reach lots of people—for a\nconsumer website, that can be millions.\nCustomer Activation: This second step in the “Get” process is much like the\n“purchase” step in the physical channel. Here the customer shows interest\nthrough a free download or trial, a request for more information, or a\npurchase. A customer should be considered activated even if he doesn’t\npurchase or register, as long as the company has enough information to recontact him (whether by e-mail, phone, text, etc.) with explicit permission to\ndo so.\nOverview: How Customers Shop Online\nUnlike the door-to-door salesmen of yesteryear, your job on the web is to\n“pull” customers to you rather than to push your product at them. The web\noffers a near-limitless tool set to help you pull customers in.\nYour job on the web is to “pull” customers to you...\nYour first step in customer acquisition and activation is understanding how\npeople buy or engage with your product. Here’s how it happens:\nStep one: People discover a need or want to solve a problem. They say, “I\nwant to throw a party,” or feel lonely and decide to find a hot party or a\ndating site. Then what?\nStep two: They begin a search. Overwhelmingly, in this century, that search\nbegins online. It often happens at Google.com, but it can happen on\nFacebook, where they ask their friends, or on Quora, where they solicit\nopinions, or on hundreds of other special-interest “recommendation” sites\nfrom Yelp to Zagat to TripAdvisor.com.\nStep three: They don’t look very hard. People don’t just “find” you online,\nand in fact they often only pay attention to the first few things they uncover\n(how often do you search beyond the first page of results on Google?). You\nmust make your site, app or product as visible as humanly possible, in as\nmany of these places as possible where your customers are likely to begin the\nsearch. (The entire “Get” section ahead will guide you in doing just this.)\nStep four: They go where they’re invited, entertained or informed. You don’t\n“earn” interest from your customers with hard-boiled sales pitches or bland\ninformation. In a typical Google search, you’re one of many thousands of\noptions the customer can click on. So you have to earn that click by providing\ninviting, helpful or entertaining information in lots of formats (copy,\ndiagrams, white papers, blogs, videos, games, demos, you name it) and by\nparticipating in the communities and social media your customers are likely\nto be.\nDevelop your “Get Customers” Strategy\nMake your information as rich and inviting—and widely available—as\npossible and cast the widest-possible net when people begin their search.\nProvide helpful, non-sales-y information that leads them back to your\nproduct, app, or site. Then the selling process begins.\nUse the way people make decisions to guide your acquisition and activation\nstrategy:\n1. Determine who your audience is, then your goal is to be prominent\nwherever they spend time on the web. Skateboarders don’t read The\nWall Street Journal or TechCrunch very much, so focus on\nskateboarding sites, blogs and the like.\n2. What kind of content will they find attractive? Our skateboarders\nprobably prefer illustrations, games, and videos over long essays and\nwhite papers. Reach them with the kinds of content they’ll find most\ninteresting and helpful, such as tips on safer skateboarding or bolder\ntricks, not long essays on the finer points of boarding.\n3. Make sure your content works in the location. Quora, Twitter, and\nFacebook users expect short, interesting items and get bogged down\nwith or ignore long ones. Social networks don’t have much use for\nlengthy sales pitches. Be sure your content “fits” where you put it.\n4. Participate in the communities your customers are a part of. Answer\nquestions, provide feedback, offer tips, and gently invite people to\nexplore your product.\n5. Create content that people want to link to. Whether it’s helpful tips,\nFAQs, cartoons or fun videos, make your content the kind of content\nyour customers want to share with friends. The result extends your\ninvitation to those friends more often than not.\nCustomer Acquisition Tactics to Test\nThe best way to get this started is to put your initial acquisition test plan into\na spreadsheet outlining the activities, their costs, and each program’s goals.\nSee a sample acquisition-plan spreadsheet in the “Activate Plan” section of\nChapter 8. Acquisition begins by using free or earned web-media\nopportunities to acquire customers, since “free” is obviously the best cost.\nThe web offers many free crowd-sourcing or acquisition opportunities (SEO,\nsocial media, viral marketing, buzz and more).\nEarned or free acquisition tactics:\nPublic relations: Generate small “test” amounts of news and feature\ncoverage about the problem (not the product itself) on websites, blogs\nand social nets. Don’t publicize the product or solution until customer\nvalidation, it’s just too early. (Public relations doesn’t mean hire an\nexpensive outside agency. During customer discovery, you should be\nlearning this firsthand.)\nViral marketing: This often-confused term refers to three types of\nacquisition marketing, each used in different web/mobile channels. The\nthree are perhaps the most important customer acquisition tactics for\nweb/mobile marketers, because they’re all free or inexpensive to\nimplement. This is discussed in “grow” customers where viral activity\nencourages customers to refer others\nSearch engine optimization (SEO), an unpaid, or “natural,” search\noption, directs consumers to the product or service\nSocial networking encourages friends and early customers to blog about\na product or a company, use Facebook to “like” it, or use Twitter and\nother tools to broadcast personal recommendations\nAfter you get the free acquisition programs going, you should start to\ntest paid tactics.\nPaid acquisition tactics:\nIt’s hard to determine how much money to spend on acquisition tactics, in\npart because there are so many variables: how much funding you have, how\nconfident you are in your hypotheses, and how hard it is to find your\ncustomers are three of the key considerations. Obviously, free tactics are\nbetter than paid tactics when they deliver quality customers with strong LTV\nin sufficient numbers to create a great business. As a rule, however, life is\nseldom that easy, and you’ll need to test a blend of paid tactics along with a\nwider variety of free ones.\nHere are some of the most common web/mobile paid acquisition tactics you\nshould consider:\nPay-per-click (PPC) advertising: targetable, accountable paid search\nadvertising on Google and other search engines drives targeted traffic to\nthe company\nOnline or traditional media advertising: often used to introduce a new\nproduct or service\nAffiliate marketing: other related websites are paid to drive traffic to the\nproduct site or app.\nOnline lead generation: purchase of permission-based e-mail lists to\nsolicit interest (much trickier and more highly regulated for direct-tomobile-phone messaging)\nReview the list of “get” customers tactics from the physical channel to\nsee which ones warrant testing for your web/mobile startup. Candidates\ncertainly include advertising, direct mail, and everything from zany on-street\npromotions to blimps, billboards and more.\nSome quick and simple acquisition tests:\nIn Phase 2 of customer discovery you’ll run some small-scale acquisition\ntests with the free and paid tactics described above to test your understanding\nof the customer problem/need. In Phase 3 of customer discovery, you’ll again\nuse acquisition tools to gauge initial customer reaction to the MVP and\ndiscover whether the MVP is a compelling solution to the problem. These are\nlimited and targeted tests, not a product launch. Press releases make no sense\nhere, for example, since wide dissemination could either bring too many\ncustomers or create the false impression that the product is “launched” and\nfinished.\nYour Phase 2 & 3 acquisition tests should be limited to controllable,\ninexpensive, easily measured tactics like these:\n• Buy $500 worth of AdWords and see if they’ll drive customers\nrepresenting five or 10 times that amount in potential revenue to the\nsite or app and at least get them to register. Test at least two different\nheadlines and as many calls to action, carefully monitoring the\nperformance of each. Drop ineffective ones and refine the best\nViral marketing can’t start until there is a customer\nbase to viralize.\n• Use Facebook messages or Tweet to measurable audiences to invite at\nleast 1,000 people to explore the new product. Test several different\nmessages or invitations to be sure the messaging about the product is\nclear. If none of the messages delivers engagement or registrations,\nthe product or offer may well be the problem\n• Viral marketing: Getting customers can’t start until there’s a customer\nbase to viralize. There are several types of viral marketing, so review\nthe viral discussion in the previous section (and also here). Networkeffect businesses should consider viral activities sooner\n• Post referral banners using Commission Junction to get sites offering\nyour offer. Spend $1,000 in referral fees to relevant websites (usually\n$12 per referral). If the banners run and the money’s largely unspent,\nmove on\n• Buy an e-mail blast list of targeted customers for $500 or $1,000. Send\nat least two versions of the offer and expect to generate at least three\ntimes the potential revenue to at least sign up, if not a purchase\n• Traffic partners are another important source of users or customers that\nfuel the “Get” effort. These are typically contractual relationships\nwith other companies that provide predictable streams of customers or\nusers to your company while you provide either customers or fees to\nthe partner. This is so important to most web/mobile businesses that\nit’s addressed in its own “traffic partners” hypothesis\nWho’s Creating This Content?\nSuccessful web/mobile startup teams have a combination of skills: great\ntechnology skills (hacking/hardware/science), great hustling skills (to search\nfor the business model, customers and market), and great user-facing design.\nThe co-founder who’s the user-interface/design expertise owns content\ncreation. Ideally he or she is talented enough to create it without legions of\nhourly-rate agency folk around. Use guru.com and craigslist.com to find\ntalent, cost-effective freelancers with good references.\nCustomer Activation Tactics to Test:\nActivation is the second step in getting customers. As discussed earlier, this\nis where the customer either makes a purchase or, at a minimum, raises a\nhand and says, “I’m interested, contact me.” Activation could be an\nexploratory visit your website or free mobile app to see how a game is\nplayed, a comment posted on a blog or social network, or the use of a free\nsearch engine. At the other end of the spectrum, low-cost mobile apps and\nother products find transactions to be the best initial activation, since the\nproduct may be a free version or cost only 99 cents.\nActivation is the choke point... where customers\ndecide whether they want to participate, play or\npurchase.\nFor web/mobile businesses, activation is the choke point—the make-orbreak place where customers decide whether they want to participate, play, or\npurchase. Here, unlike the physical channel, the “product is the salesman,”\nencouraging visitors to explore, try, or read about the product on their own,\nwithout pressure or patter from a sales representative. Activation is always\nencouraged by a compelling value proposition, well-communicated and\ncoupled with a good, clear offer and a low-fidelity (in discovery) or hifidelity (in validation) MVP. Start by creating an activation-tactics plan in\nsimple spreadsheet form as in this example.\nMany startups falsely assume that because their customers are online,\nonline communication is all their customers want or expect. Very often, even\na single phone call can make a dramatic difference in acquisition and\nactivation rates. In some instances, as few as half the customers who discover\na product online will activate or buy without human-to-human contact. And\nthe presence of a phone number is known to communicate the company’s\nauthenticity. Just the presence of the company’s phone number—even if\nnever called—can increase its online click-through rate by five percent to 30\npercent. (When adding a phone number, be sure it’s answered promptly,\nknowledgeably, and effectively by someone with incentives to activate the\ncaller.)\nAcquisition and Activation in Web/Mobile Channels (Figure 3.15)\nSome quick activation tests:\n• Capture the customer’s e-mail address and get permission to follow up\nwith further information. Follow up with 1,000 customers and expect\nat least 50 or more to agree to activate\n• Offer incentives for activation: Offer a free trial, download, or white\npaper or a significant discount to 500 or 1,000 customers. Try this\nwith at least three different offers, hoping to find at least one that\ngenerates a 5 percent or greater response rate. Keep testing until you\ndo, and then calculate the revenue model based on response rates, and\ncosts\n• Call 100 prospects who don’t activate immediately. See if the phone\ncalls generate enough of a response-rate improvement to warrant the\ncost. Three times the response rate is probably needed\n• Free-to-paid conversion: Offer a seven- or 14-day free trial of an app,\nservice, or web/mobile product. Then compare the total 60-day\nacquisition revenue with the Get results of the typical paid offer. Or\noffer the use of some but not all of the site or app’s features.\neHarmony.com, for example, lets people find their ideal matches for\nfree but requires paid enrollment to tell your dream date that you’ve\ndiscovered him or her\nEven a single phone call can make a dramatic\ndifference in acquisition and activation rates.\n• Use free-download websites to offer free downloads or trials. Make\nsure the revenue generated over a 90-day period exceeds that of the\nstandard activation offer\nMonitor the results of all tests and, when you’re not satisfied (or it fails\nyour pass/fail test) revise the program and test again.\nKeeping Customers (Customer Retention)\nThe “Keep Customers” Funnel in Web/Mobile Channels (Figure 3.16)\nKeeping customers in the web/mobile channels has the same goal as\nretention efforts in the physical world: to minimize customer churn/attrition\nby providing great products and services, and interacting with customers\noften. (At this point in customer discovery, there aren’t customers to retain,\nso identify retention programs to test in the future.) Retention is done more\neasily online, where companies have the incredible power and ability to track\nand monitor every single prospect’s or customer’s individual behavior or lack\nof behavior (without violating their privacy).\n“Keep Customers” Tools in Web/Mobile Channels (Table 3.4b)\nLoyalty and points programs and other tactics borrowed from the\nphysical channel can also play a significant role here, as can elegant\npersonalized customer service and support, conducted digitally as much as\npossible. Strong digital help tools, FAQs, user blogs, clubs, and newsletters\nhelp with retention as well.\nCustomer Retention Strategy\nRetention programs live or die by a close monitoring of customer behavior to\nlearn who’s staying and who’s leaving and why. It’s critical to instrument the\nproduct not in order to track everything but in order to follow the most\nimportant customer behaviors you want to improve.\nFor example:\nTrack start dates and sources of each customer (referred by a blogger,\nanother site, etc.)\nTrack customers’ activity level individually. How often do they come?\nHow long is each visit? What’s the time span between visits?\nWhen do customers abandon, and what were they doing that caused\nthem to do so?\nMonitor customers’ behavior on-site: what do they click on, what don’t\nthey click on?\nTrack customer referrals to others and the sources and activity level of\nreferred visitors\nTrack the results of each promotion, whether outbound or on the site\nitself\nPROCEED WITH CAUTION: Remember, this is an\noverview/tutorial. There’s no way you can implement all this or even\nprocess this in one sitting.\nKeep the following guidelines in mind as you test:\nE-mail is easy to ignore and at times feels like spam, so be careful about\noverly relying on it. At least four of five e-mails are never opened, and\nconsumers often unsubscribe from self-serving marketing e-mails\nConsumers often resent “faux” personalization. People appreciate\nlegitimate, helpful personalization if they’ve opted in for example\n(“Here are the sneakers we have in your size, 11D” is far better than\n“Great buys for Bob”)\nDon’t get lazy and make automated marketing and e-mail programs your\nonly customer-retention efforts. Focus on great product, product\nenchancements, terrific service and other core retention initiatives\nEmbrace social networks as points of retention. Use them to keep\nvisibility high and to invite customers and friends back often\nThe key for retention for web/mobile channels is that the data customers\nhave given you make personalized retention efforts easy. But you need to\ncollect it. Observe each customer’s behavior and interact with customers\nbased on what they do or don’t do.\nTrack the behavior of each customer individually. Use that data to create\na personal one-to-one relationship that guides him to the next steps the\ncompany wants him to take. (But always respect personal-data privacy.)\nRetention programs live or die by a close\nmonitoring of customer behavior.\nSimple Retention Tests to Consider:\nThe hypothesis should include some core initial retention efforts that will be\ndiscussed during discovery and tested on a modest scale later, during\ncustomer validation. Be sure to include digital versions of relevant programs\noutlined in the physical section. Some specific tactics to test:\n• Outreach programs, including welcome e-mails, how-to guides, and\nphone calls thanking the user for coming aboard and offering simple\ntips on how to get more out of the product. Consider retention e-mails\nlike these:\nWe haven’t seen you visit in two weeks. Is everything OK?\nI’ve noticed you’ve had a few problems. How can we help?\nHave you seen some of the new features on our site?\nHere are five “power user” ideas for getting more out of your time\nat XYZ.com\n• Blogs, RSS and news feeds to further engage customers or users with\nthe product or site\n• Loyalty programs that encourage and reward repeat visits, purchases, or\nreferrals borrowed from the physical channel\n• Contests and special events: webinars, special guests, new features, and\nother reasons for current customers to come back\n• Mobile app push notifications: iOS/Android gives developers the\nability to push messages to users even when the app is closed. For app\ndevelopers, getting this right is critical to retention and customer\nengagement\n• Product updates and enhancements to the actual product itself always\ndrive loyalty and retention (and communicating them to customers\nhelps)\nGetting new customers is painful and costly, so\nkeeping those already on the roster is easier and\nmore cost-effective.\n• Placing live phone calls to users several weeks or (if annual) a month\nor more before contract renewal is a good option if you have a\nsubscription revenue model. Make them friendly, service-oriented\ncalls, but always listen for signs of potential churn and be ready with\na deal, discount or offer to save the customer. Remember: getting new\ncustomers is painful and costly, so keeping those already on the roster\nis easier and more cost-effective\n• Tips-and-tricks newsletters, time-triggered e-mails every seven or 14\ndays based on users’ on-site behavior or lack of visits\n• Personalized customer service and support, conducted digitally as\nmuch as possible. Strong digital help tools, FAQs, user blogs, clubs,\nand newsletters help with retention as well\n• Customer lock-in/high switching costs: If it’s relatively easy for your\ncustomer to switch from your products to your competitors’ (in an\nexisting market) you’ll probably have a higher churn rate. You may\nwant to consider tactics to “lock in” your customer to your product or\nsolution (through unique technology, data that can’t be transferred—\nthink Facebook and LinkedIn—or high startup costs with a new\nvendor.)\nMonitor Specific Retention Metrics\nMonitor and act on at least these basic retention metrics:\nsigns of dwindling visits, page views or time spent on the site or app\nincreased time between visits\naverage customer life (how long they stay active) and, if possible later,\nlifetime value\nincreases in complaints, help or support tickets\nreduced response rates or open rates on company e-mails\nOrganize the metrics around “cohorts,” or common groups of customers\n(like “those who joined in January”), since, for example, three-month\ncustomers may behave one way while nine-month customers may be much\nmore or less active than their newer brethren.\nGrowing Customers (New Revenue and Referrals)\nThe “Grow Customers” Funnel in Web/Mobile Channels\n(Figure 3.17)\nThere are two ways to grow existing customers: get current customers to\nspend more money or encourage them to send more customers to the\ncompany.\nPROCEED WITH CAUTION: Remember, this is an\noverview/tutorial. There’s no way you can implement all this or even\nprocess this in one sitting.\n“Grow Customers” Tools for Web/Mobile Channels (Table 3.4c)\n1. Get Current Customers to Spend More\nGetting current customers to buy more starts by making sure they’re satisfied\nwith the product, performance and price. Then you try to sell them more\nproduct, upgrade their service, or extend their contracts. These activities are\nimportant for the long-term, so test at least a few during customer validation.\nSome of the basic approaches to Grow Customers include:\nCross-sell programs that encourage buyers of a product to buy adjacent\nproducts. Getting buyers of toner cartridges, for example—to buy paper,\npencils, and other office products\nUp-selling programs that promote the purchase of “more” of higher-end\nproducts. For example, buying cases of toner rather than single\ncartridges, or the purchase of copiers, fax machines and other office\nmachines along with the toner\nNext-selling programs that concentrate on the next order: can the\ncompany encourage a long-term toner contract, sell the customer\nenvelopes to put the copies in, or become his primary office-products\nsupplier? These basic customer growth strategies work in consumer\ngoods as well as business-to-business\nUnbundling, which sometimes grows revenue. If a product is complex\nor multi-featured, split it into several products, each sold separately.\nThis works well in many tech, software, and industrial product areas\nFor now, develop a hypothesis about how the company will grow its\ncustomers, and test those ideas with—who else?—customers.\nSome simple “grow” programs to consider:\nEvery “thank you” or confirmation page should suggest multiple items\nthe customer may also find interesting, and ideally provide an incentive\nfor doing so\nNew items, special offers, and discounts for increasing the order size\nshould be prominent and integrated with the checkout process for high\nvisibility\ne-commerece companies should have “recommendation engines.” “If\nyou bought X, you’ll love Y”\ne-commerce companies should include special offers and discounts in\neach shipment\ne-mail customers to introduce new and different products or “add-on”\nfeatures to buy\nPromote special sales and offers on new products or services the\ncustomer hasn’t bought\nCustomer referrals are the most common type of viral marketing,\nalthough they obviously can’t begin until you actually have customers\n(so it’s discussed in the “Grow” section). Viral marketing stimulates\nreferrals of customers from other happy customers. Generate attention\namong the largest audience possible. Consider tools like YouTube and\nconferences you can attend and perhaps speak or promote at. Encourage\nfriends of the company and its team to invite their friends to learn more.\nConsider contests, sweepstakes and promotions to drive the reach of\nviral efforts\nViral products help sell themselves. Hotmail, Gmail, Facebook and\nmany other web products end every customer communication by saying,\n“Invite a friend to use our service.” When used, it’s powerful and\nvirtually free viral marketing\nNetwork-effect virality boosts usage of products like Skype,\nPhotobucket, and even fax machines. You can’t talk via Skype with a\nfriend who doesn’t have it or fax someone without a fax machine, so\ncustomers encourage others to join, expanding the network for their own\nbenefit. In the process, they get new users for the company\nCustomer referrals are the most “honest” source of\nnew business...\n2. Get Customers to Send More Customers to the\nCompany\nThere are lots of different viral marketing tools and tactics that help you get\ncustomers to refer other customers to the company. Here are the six most\npowerful viral marketing techniques to consider:\nEncourage customers to “like” the product on Facebook\nOffer customers discounts or free trial offers to share with friends\nEnable customers to e-mail their friends using their address books to\ncreate mailing lists\nCreate contests or incentives to encourage Tweeting, “liking” and other\nviral activities\nHighlight social-networking action buttons on the site to make viral\nefforts easy\nEncourage bloggers to write about the product, and reward them for\ndoing so\n(The customer relationship hypotheses should also address how the\n“Get, Keep and Grow” programs will be optimized once they’re under way.)\nKey Resources Hypothesis\nThis brief identifies external resources critical to the company’s success and\nhow you’ll find and secure them.\nKey resources fall into four main categories: physical, financial, human\nand intellectual property. In each relevant category, create a list of the key\nresources you’ll require, what you expect to pay, and where you’ll go to find\nthem.\nPhysical resources: These fall into two types: company facilities and\nproduct/service resources. Examples of company facilities are office space\nand company location (near mass transit to more easily attract lots of\nemployees, in a city with great restaurants, etc.). Product/services may\ninclude a steady supply of superthin silicon wafers or iron ore or thousands of\nfeet of warehouse space or specialized lab or manufacturing space. Many\nresources are capital-intensive, particularly where physical goods are\nconcerned—manufacturing equipment, raw materials, and the like.\n...many of the capital-intensive resources have\nbecome utilities or can be outsourced.\nIn the 21\nst century, many of the capital-intensive equipment or services\nresources companies used to need to physically own and pay for have\nbecome utilities or can be outsourced. For example, startups that need\ncomputing and server capacity can buy processing power and storage, in the\ncloud, from Amazon.com and many others (slashing the cost of a software\nstartup by a factor of 10 or more). Manufacturing that used to be a capitalintensive is now outsourced to Asia (with an equally significant reduction in\ncost). IT and services can be done cheaper in India, etc.\nFinancial resources: Money is the lifeblood of startups. You stay in business\nuntil you run out of it. This book is about how to reduce startup infant\nmortality by making everything you do less wasteful and more cash-efficient.\nThere are tons of articles, websites and entire books on how to raise\nmoney for a startup—and whom to raise it from. Friends and family, crowd\nfunding, angels, venture capital and corporate partners are the usual suspects.\nBut don’t overlook government grants as an alternative funding source for\nnew ventures. In the U.S., the grants.gov website is the first stop for a number\nof sources such as SBA (Small Business Administration) and SBIR (Small\nBusiness Innovation Research) grants.\nCompanies selling physical products have additional sources of capital:\nEquipment lease line. This lets you finance the entire purchase price of\nbusiness equipment or commercial vehicles. Typically offered by a\nbank, a lease line can be a great solution whether you need to preserve\nworking capital for other expenses or you’re in an expansion phase and\nneed financing\nFactoring. If you’ve sold product to a customer who takes a while to\npay, you can sell your accounts receivable (i.e., the invoices) to a third\nparty (called a factor) at a discount. It provides your company with\nimmediate cash\nVendor financing. This is a loan arrangement that takes place between\nyour company and a vendor that supplies large volumes of their product\nto you. The vendor lends money to you so you can buy products from it\nDon’t forget the Human Resources\nHuman resources fall into three categories: personal advice (mentors,\nteachers, and coaches), company advisors, and qualified employees.\nTeachers, coaches, and mentors are people you’ll need to help you\nadvance your personal career. If you want to learn about a specific subject,\nfind a teacher. If you want to hone specific skills or reach an exact goal, hire\na coach. If you want to get smarter and better over the course of your career,\nfind someone who cares about you enough to be a mentor.\nAdvisors are people you’ll need to help advance your company’s\nsuccess. Founders fail when they believe their visions are facts. Listening to\nadvice based on experience can help you sort through whether your vision is\na hallucination. Getting an advisory board (by expanding your circle of\naccumulated wisdom beyond your investors) is so important that it’s an\nexplicit step in the Customer Development process.\nQualified and motivated employees are the difference between a good\nidea that never goes anywhere and a billion-dollar firm. Will your company\nneed dozens of specialized engineers or coders or designers as it grows? If so,\nwhere and how will you find them? Is your city or location a magnet for\nworld-class talent? Is there a shortage of talent? Will offshore teams be\nrequired as the company scales, and how will you select and manage them?\nIn more specialized industries (think avionics, chip design, and biotech) this\nmay be even more challenging if scaling the team quickly is important,\nespecially if the company is headquartered in a smaller or off-the-beaten-path\nlocation to where you’ll have to relocate much of your talent pool in order to\nemploy them. If you’re in a part of the country or the world where the\nnumber of potential employees is limited, how can you be more creative to\nget them? Identify what the human resource needs are now and what they\nwill be two to three years later to be sure that growth won’t be constrained.\nIntellectual Property is a Key Resource\nIntellectual property gives you rights to stop others from using your\ncreativity. The assets you can protect may include your “core technology,”\nsuch as source code, hardware designs, architecture, processes, and formulas.\nOr it can be your brand, logo or domain name. You can protect business\nprocesses, know-how, customer information, and product roadmaps.\nProtection is also available for content such as music, books, and film. Some\nof these assets are protected automatically. For other classes, it’s wise and\nsometimes mandatory to go through a registration, application or examination\nprocess to get full protection.\nTrademark: A trademark protects branding and marks and gives you the\nright to prevent others from using “confusingly similar” marks and logos.\nTrademark protection lasts as long as you use the mark. The more you use the\nmark, the stronger your protection. Trademark registration is optional but has\nsignificant advantages if approved.\nCopyright: A copyright protects creative works of authorship, typically\nsongs, books, movies, photos, etc. Copyright gives you the right to prohibit\nothers from copying, distributing or making derivatives of your work. It\nprotects “expressions” of ideas but doesn’t protect the underlying ideas. (If\nyour product is software, copyright is also used to prohibit someone from\nstealing your software and reselling it as machine and/or source code.)\nCopyright protection lasts practically forever. Registration is optional but is\nrequired for suing for infringement.\nTYPES OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION\nTypes of Intellectual Property Protection (Table 3.5)\nContract: A contract is a binding legal agreement that’s enforceable in a\ncourt of law. There’s no official registration process; you have whatever\nprotection is defined in the contract (e.g., a nondisclosure agreement gives\nyou certain rights to protection of your confidential information). The\nprotection lasts for the time period defined in the contract.\nPatents: A patent is a monopoly the government grants to prohibit\nothers from making, using or selling your invention, even when the other\nparty’s infringement is innocent or accidental.\nJust about anything can be patented—circuits, hardware, software,\napplied algorithms, formulas, designs, user interfaces, applications, systems.\nScientific principles or pure mathematical algorithms may not be patented.\nYour invention must be “nonobvious.” The test for whether it’s nonobvious\nis: given the prior art at the time of the invention, would a typical engineer 1)\nidentify the problem and 2) solve it with the invention? You must be “first to\nfile.” You must file in the U.S. within a year of sale, offer for sale, public\ndisclosure or public use. Your patent application has to include a written\ndescription with details of the claims of the invention. The details have to\nallow others to duplicate your invention from your description and have to\nuse the “best mode” in describing critical techniques/technologies. And it has\nto identify all prior “art,” or solutions to the problem.\nPatent protection typically lasts 15 to 20 years. There is a formal\napplication and examination process. Each patent filing will cost your\ncompany $20,000 to $50,000 and take one to four years to complete. Filing\nof patents is frequently of major interest to people funding your company.\n(There’s something called a “provisional patent” that’s an alternative to a full\npatent. It allows you to claim “first to file” and use the term patent pending.\nProvisional patents get into the patent office quickly and cheaply. However,\nthey automatically expire after one year, and no patent rights are granted.\nProvisional patents are a good placeholder because they’re cheap to file and\ndon’t get in the way of your other patent efforts.)\nIntellectual Property Creates Value\nIntellectual property is an asset for your company. You need to acquire,\nprotect and exploit it. You can map out an intellectual property strategy by\nasking:\nWho are the key players and technologies in its market(s)?\nWhat are the most important ideas and inventions that need patents (or\nprovisional patents)? Start filing these early!\nWhat are the important patent applications that come next?\nFour Common Intellectual Property Mistakes\nStartups Make\n1. Founders didn’t make a clean break with previous employer: Do your\nemployers or university own or have a claim on your inventions? It’s a\nvery subjective standard, and since startups don’t often have resources or\ntime to spend on lawsuits, large companies and universities may use\nthreats of litigation to ensure that you don’t take anything. Therefore the\nbest advice is to “take only memories.”\n2. Your startup cannot show that it owns its intellectual property: Take the\ntime to create a clear, well-documented chain of title (think lab\nnotebooks) to your intellectual property. If you’re using independent\ncontractors, make sure you have written agreements assigning work\ncreated. Make sure you have Employee Invention Assignment\nAgreements. (If you hire subcontractors or friends to do some work, get\nassignment agreements as well.)\n3. You lost your patent rights due to filing delays/invention disclosures: In\nthe U.S., patent rights are forfeited if you wait more than a year after:\n• disclosure in a printed publication (white paper, journal/conference\narticle, website)\n• offer for sale in the U.S. (start of sales effort, price list, price quotation,\ntrade-show demonstration, any demonstration not under NDA, public\nuse in the U.S.)\nIn most foreign countries, there is no one-year grace period.\n4. Your company grants “challenging” licenses to intellectual property:\nStartups acquiring their first customers may give special licensing terms\nin key markets, territories, etc.—e.g., a grant of “most favored nations”\nlicense terms or other licensee-favorable economic terms. This can make\nyour intellectual property less valuable to future buyers of your company.\nOr you may cut a deal that you can’t assign or transfer (or can’t get out\nof) if you get acquired.\nThere May be Other Key Resources\nConsider other external business elements that are vital to the company’s\nsuccess. Celebrity websites need a steady stream of “hot” gossip (this one\nshouldn’t be a problem) and MarthaStewart.com wouldn’t be much without\nMartha. Overstock.com would fail without a stream of good-quality discount\nmerchandise.\nDependency Analysis\nThe company’s dependency analysis basically answers the question “To sell\nour product in volume, what has to happen that’s out of our control?” Things\nout of a company’s control can include other technology infrastructure that\nneeds to emerge (all cell phones become web-enabled, fiber optics are in\nevery home, electric cars are selling in volume). Dependencies also include\nchanges in consumers’ lifestyles or buying behavior, new laws, changes in\neconomic conditions, and so on. Specify what needs to happen (let’s say the\nwidespread adoption of telepathy), when it needs to happen (must be\ncommon among teens by 2020), and what happens if it doesn’t happen (the\nproduct needs to use the Internet instead). Note the benchmarks you’ll use to\nmeasure whether the change is happening when needed.\nIdentify all key resources in this hypothesis, and explain how the\ncompany will make sure those key resources are readily available. Be sure to\nidentify the risks of their unavailability, as well as alternatives that will\nminimize impact on the company’s business model. Be careful not to confuse\npartners (to be discussed next) with resources.\nChecklist 10: Key Resources Hypothesis\nGoal: Identify external resources critical to the company’s success, and how\nthe company will find and secure them\nReference: Chapter 3, Key Resources\nDescribe the all key resources costs, and how they will be acquired\nPhysical resources\nFinancial resources\nHuman resources\nIntellectual property\nOther key resources\nDependency analysis\nExit criteria:\nPhysical, financial, human, intellectual property resources required\nWhat they will cost\nWhere they’ll be found\nHow they will be secured\nUpdate your business model canvas\nPass/Fail tests identified\nPartners Hypothesis\nKey partners often provide capabilities, products, or services that the startup\neither can’t or would prefer not to develop itself. Batteries for a flashlight\nmaker or design services for a website are two simple examples. But the most\nfamous is Apple and the iPod. Without the record labels providing music as\ncontent, the iPod and iTunes would simply be another hardware/software\nplayer. The partners made the business model the juggernaut it is today.\nThe key-partners hypothesis names the essential partners your company\nwill require, along with the “value exchange” with each one (as in “we give\nthem money, they send us customers”). Partnerships generally fall into four\nkey areas: strategic alliances; “coopetition,” or cooperation between\ncompetitors; joint new business development efforts; and key supplier\nrelationships.\nThink of this hypothesis as a simple three-column spreadsheet. The\nheadings: partner name (list primary and runner-up candidates), “what they\nprovide,” and “what we provide.” Don’t feel bad when the word money\nappears repeatedly in the third column. It’s fairly typical for startups, at least\nin their early days.\nStrategic alliances, generally between noncompetitive companies, can\noften shorten the list of things your startup needs to build or provide to offer a\ncomplete product or service. For physical products, alliance partners might\nprovide product training, installation or service, peripherals or accessories,\nwhether they’re sold under your startup’s brand name or not. Specialized\nservice firms in many industries (law, accounting, engineering, IT) can often\nmarket a wider range of services by combining their services with those of\nother specialists. Alliances can also be used to broaden a startup’s footprint,\nmaking its product more available in geographies where the startup itself\ncan’t support sales or service.\nJoint new business development efforts generally happen later in a\nstartup’s life, but can be important once the startup has established its own\nidentity and brand. Dell and HP sell lots of software and products made by\nothers, but seldom do so until they’re confident the product has significant\nconsumer demand. Think of these as longer-term opportunities to investigate\nas part of your customer discovery process.\n“Coopetition” similarly happens later in a startup’s life, as a rule. It’s a\nform of working with a direct competitor to share costs or market together.\nNew York City’s “fashion week” is a good example of coopetition for\nestablished fashion houses. While they’re fiercely competitive, they work\ntogether to coordinate fashion show schedules so the top buyers can attend all\nthe key showings. Word for Mac is perhaps the greatest coopetition example\nof all time, but both companies were well-established before the product was\ndeveloped and launched.\nKey supplier relationships can mean life or death for a startup. Imagine\nhow tough it would be to churn out millions of iPhones without Foxconn, the\nmassive Apple manufacturing partner in China, or to make Ben & Jerry’s\nfamed Cherry Garcia without an uninterrupted supply of delicious cherries.\nSuppliers can be instrumental to any company’s success, but tight, flexible\npartnerships can be absolutely critical. Many startups outsource a variety of\n“back office” functions, ranging from warehousing and fulfillment of\nphysical goods to HR, payroll, benefits and accounting. These outsource\nsuppliers act as extensions of the company that leverage the suppliers’\nexpertise to improve the startup’s efficiency and cost structure.\nWill the partner flex its delivery times, order-size requirements, credit\nterms or even its price in your startup’s early days? How will the partner\nensure a steady supply that rises (quickly, we hope) or falls in line with\ncustomer demand? Identify the key suppliers in this hypothesis, along with\nwhat you’ll need from them. You’ll visit with them later to validate this\nhypothesis and understand your role and theirs in forging a mutually\nbeneficial relationship.\nChecklist 11: Partners Hypothesis\nGoal: Identify essential partners and the company’s “value exchange” with\neach\nReference: Chapter 3, Partners\nUnderstand Potential Partner Types\nStrategic Alliances\nJoint new business efforts\nCoopetition\nKey suppliers\nList your target partners\nNecessary partners\nWhat they will provide\nHow the Company will reciprocate\nExit criteria:\nUnderstand potential partner types\nList target partners, their contributions and what the company will offer\nin return\nUpdate your business model canvas\nPass/Fail tests identified\nRevenue and Pricing Hypothesis\nThe revenue and pricing brief may well be the toughest of all, but it’s\ncritically important, since it ensures that the business model makes financial\nsense. In a way, this brief is elegantly simple, since it asks only four\nquestions:\n1. How many of these things will we sell?\n2. What’s the revenue model?\n3. How much will we charge?\n4. Does this add up to a business that’s worth doing?\nRevenue Sources (Figure 3.18)\nWhile some of the issues differ from channel to channel, the process of\ncomputing your company’s revenue is fundamentally the same, regardless of\nchannel. The good news: much of the work for this brief is already complete.\nQuestion 1: How Many Will We Sell?\nIn the physical channel, companies generate revenue by selling their product,\ncollecting revenue either as a one-time sale, via time payments, or through\nsuch financial tools as leasing or subscriptions. They also solicit referrals\nfrom current customers, often rewarding customers for referring others.\nCollect the following revenue stream components from hypotheses\ncompleted earlier:\nMarket size and market share hypotheses, which should translate into\nthe anticipated number of customers (as in 10 percent of a millionperson market = 100,000 customers)\nChannel hypotheses, along with estimates of their volume potential and\nchannel costs\nBe sure to include (subtract, really) the channel’s cost of sales, which\ncan be enormous, since the company only gets to “count,” or keep, net\nrevenue received after channel costs are subtracted. (Enthusiastic\nentrepreneurs make this mistake far too often)\nQuestion 2: How Much Do We Charge? (Pricing\nTactics)\nThis is a two-part question. Part one assesses the costs of doing business. For\nphysical products, this is often far more important. If you’re selling canned\npeas or microwave relay towers, there’s a clear, sizeable cost of the physical\nproduct itself: parts, assembly, packaging, shipping, and more.\nIn business-to-business and some consumer sales, other issues warrant\nconsideration, such as total cost of operation (if rent is high or staff is huge,\nor the electric bill is a high component of product cost).\nPart two of the “how much will we charge” question is simple: “what’s\nthe price?” You will start testing your pricing hypothesis later in discovery,\nbut first there’s a bit more work to do.\nA good pricing model recognizes Market Type, accommodates\nmanufacturing costs, the value the product delivers, market beliefs, and\ncompetitive prices. It also charges “as much as the market will bear” to\nmaximize profits. For best results, start with a deep understanding of\ncompetitive pricing.\nStartups have lots of choices in selecting their pricing models. Among\nthe most popular pricing models:\nValue pricing: Based on the value delivered by the product rather than\nthe cost itself. Investing or accounting software tools, unique patented\nproducts and pharmaceuticals can sometimes optimize profits with this\nmodel\nCompetitive pricing: Positions the product against others in its\ncompetitive set, typically in existing markets\nVolume pricing: Designed to encourage multiple purchases or users, in\nsituations ranging from office supplies to SAAS software\nPortfolio pricing: For companies with multiple products and services,\neach with a different cost and utility. Here the objective is to make\nmoney with the portfolio, some with high markups and some with low,\ndepending on competition, lock-in, value delivered, and loyal customers\nThe “razor/razor blade” model: Part of the product is free or\ninexpensive, but it pulls through highly profitable repeat purchases on an\nongoing basis. (Think of the cost of ink-jet printers compared with the\ncost of the ink.) Often challenging for startups due to the upfront cost\nSubscription: While now thought of as a software strategy, the Book of\nthe Month Club pioneered this for physical products\nLeasing: Lowers the entry cost for customers. Provides constant\nearnings over a period of years\nProduct-based pricing: Based on a multiple of actual product cost.\nUsually for physical goods. (Typically priced for maximum\nrevenue/profit versus volume)\nTwo Business-to-Business Pricing Issues\nTotal Cost of Ownership/Adoption (TCO): More an issue in business than\nin consumer sales, the TCO analysis estimates the total cost to customers of\nbuying and using the product. For business products, do customers need to\nbuy a new computer to run the software? Do they need training to use the\nproduct? Do other physical or organizational changes need to happen? What\nwill deployment across a whole company cost? For consumer products,\nmeasure the cost of “adopting” the product to fit consumer needs. Do\ncustomers need to change their lifestyle? Do they need to change any part of\ntheir purchasing or usage behavior? Do they need to throw away something\nthey use today?\nReturn on Investment (ROI): When setting prices for sales to\ncorporations, your company may have to prove to them the purchase price\nwas “worth it,” or that they got “a good deal,” which may be less about price\nthan about the total return on their investment. As a rule, companies focus\nmore on ROI than consumers do, partly because of the size of and oversight\non large transactions. ROI represents customers’ expectation of their\ninvestment measured against goals such as problem-solving, productivity,\ntime, money and resources. For consumers, return often includes status or\nstyle and sometimes even just plain fun.\nWhen selling to businesses, prepare a hypothetical ROI in advance of\ninitial customer meetings. (This is often a good subject for a helpful white\npaper.) If the solution doesn’t return a meaningful multiple ROI, sales may be\ndifficult. That $50,000 robot vacuum system as a replacement for a $5,000\nannual cleaning bill may be a tough sell, especially after a good job on the\nTCO (maintenance, electricity, parts and more) as part of the ROI\ncomputation.\nQuestion 3: Do Revenues Point to a Business Worth\nDoing?\nYou have to do more than multiply the volume by the average selling price to\nget the answer to this question, but don’t worry—this answer doesn’t need to\nbe precise just yet. Remember, the goal of customer discovery is to refine a\nbusiness model enough to test it on a larger scale in the next step, customer\nvalidation. So at this point, with a rough view of the gross revenue and all the\nfixed and variable costs involved, make a rough computation of the\nfollowing:\nIs the revenue adequate to cover costs in the short term?\nWill the revenue grow materially if not dramatically over time?\nDoes the profitability get better as the revenues get bigger?\nAgain, this is a rough, back-of-the-envelope calculation used only to\ndecide if what you found in discovery moves your forward to customer\nvalidation. It’s not an accounting exercise.\nRemember, you have limited resources. Focus first on the one key, big\nsource of revenue before expanding into secondary sources, which can be\ndistracting to the company.\nTwo More Revenue Issues to Consider\nDistribution Channel Affects Revenue Streams. Calculating revenue is\neasy for a product sold directly by your own sales force: You simply deduct\nany discount you gave the customer from the list price of the product. When\nyou sell through indirect channels, revenue calculations might be harder.\nSelling to Walmart is wonderful, but most retails channels have “return\nrights.” (If your product doesn’t move off their shelf, you have to take it\nback.) Are you selling to OEMs where the discount is steep and the revenue\nto your company doesn’t appear until the OEM begins selling in volume?\nConsider Lifetime Value: How much will the customer ultimately spend not\njust in the first sale but over the life of his or her relationship with the\ncompany? SAAS software, dating websites, and online gaming focus on\ncustomer lifetime value. Customers can sign up for salesforce.com, for\nexample, sometimes for a few dollars a month, but the company no doubt\nspends several times that amount to attract and sign a new user. Why?\nBecause it understands that the average salesforce.com subscription lasts\nmany months, making the new customer worth a multiple of the monthly cost\n—provided, of course, that the company stays in business long enough to\ncollect the revenue. (On the other hand, the lifetime value of a demolition\ncontractor’s typical customer often approximates his first invoice.)\nCustomer lifetime value dramatically affects revenue stream and pricing\nstrategy, online or off, although other than magazine and newspaper\nsubscriptions, which are declining rapidly, there are scant few subscription\nproducts beyond gym memberships among physical products.\nFinal Draft of a Business Model Hypothesis (Figure 3.19)\nTie the Components of Revenue Together in a\nHypothesis\nRevenue stream and pricing interact with the value proposition, the channel,\ncustomer relationships, and the other business model components. That\nmeans there’ll be lots of iterating and pivoting. The revenue stream\nhypothesis will be tested repeatedly before it’s cast in stone, first in customer\ndiscovery discussions and again with more customers as part of customer\nvalidation. When the draft of the revenue stream brief is complete, re-validate\nit to see that the math adds up. Ultimately, only one answer matters: can we\ngenerate enough revenue, profits and growth to make this business worth our\ntime and energy?\nCompleting the Hypothesis Development Process:\nThis brief completes the company’s only large-scale paperwork exercise. The\naction now moves outside the building so you can start to understand what\npotential customers need and to qualify or refine the initial hypothesis\nassumptions. But before doing that:\nConvene a team meeting where a large copy of the latest business model\ncanvas and briefs are taped to a wall. A summary of each of the briefs\nshould be adjacent to the canvas\nAll participants should read each of the business model briefs\nLook at the summaries on the canvas, read the details in the briefs,\ndiscuss them as a team, and look for obvious conflicts or\ninconsistencies.\nFounders, product development, engineering and operations teams\nshould again validate cost assumptions and changes\nReturn to the first hypotheses developed to be certain there’s no conflict\nfrom one to the next. Does the sales channel make sense, for example, in\nlight of the pricing, need for installation, etc.? Will fewer customers still\nadequately fund overhead and development?\nReview and agree on the final versions of each hypothesis\nMake certain the hypothesis summaries agree with the summary in the\nappropriate business model box\nUpdate the business model as appropriate\nNow it’s time to move ahead and get out of the office, where customers\nand facts live.\nChecklist 12: Revenue And Pricing Hypothesis\nGoal: See if the business model makes financial sense\nReference: Chapter 4, Revenue and Pricing Hypothesis\nHow many will we sell?\nMarket Size & Market share hypotheses\nChannel hypothesis\nWhat’s the Revenue Model\nSales?\nSubscriptions?\nPay-per-use?\nReferral?\nAffiliate?\nWhat Are the Pricing Tactics\nValue pricing\nCompetitive pricing\nVolume pricing\nPortfolio pricing\nRazor/razor blade model\nSubscription\nLeasing\nFreemium\nEtc.\nDoes it Add up to a Business Worth Doing?\nExit criteria:\nThe units/users, revenue model and pricing add up to a business worth\ndoing\nPass/Fail tests identified\n\nCHAPTER 4\nCustomer Discovery, Phase Two: “Get Out\nof the Building” to Test the Problem: “Do\nPeople Care?”\nPHASE 2 GETS THE TEAM “OUT OF THE BUILDING” to test the problem and to\nanswer three key questions:\nDo we really understand the customer’s problem?\nDo enough people really care enough about the problem for this to\nbecome a huge business?\nAnd will they care enough to tell their friends?\nThe next section, Phase 3, will test to see whether the product offers a\ncompelling solution to customers who have said there’s a problem. When the\n“problem” and “solution” questions are answered with a resounding “yes,”\nproduct/market fit is achieved and it’s time to move on to customer\nvalidation.\nThis phase includes five key steps:\ndesigning experiments for customer tests\npreparing for customer contacts and engagement\ntesting customers understanding of the problem and assessing its\nimportance to customers\ngaining understanding of customers\ncapturing competitive and market knowledge\nAs this phase gets under way, here’s a reminder of the key rules from\nthe Customer Development Manifesto in Chapter 1:\nCustomer discovery is done by the founders\nHypotheses require testing. Testing requires experiments to be designed\nWeb surveys are nice, but always correlate them with face-to-face\ncustomer feedback, even for web businesses\nCustomer meetings aren’t about learning whether customers love the\nproduct, at least not yet. They’re about understanding the problem and\nhow urgently your potential customers need to solve that problem.\nYou’ll focus more on the product itself once you’re certain the problem\nit solves is big enough to create a market worth going after\nInitial hypotheses rarely survive feedback without iterations or pivots\nDesign Tests and Pass/Fail Experiments\nAt this point, your Phase One business model hypotheses are still just\n“guesses.” In this phase you’ll turn those hypotheses into facts by getting out\nof the building and testing them in front of customers.\nHere’s an easy way to visualize this: think of a three-layer business\nmodel. The bottom layer represents your initial vision of the startup. The\nsecond layer outlines the detailed hypotheses you just developed in Phase\nOne. The third layer shows the tests you’ll conduct to verify and measure\neach hypothesis, turning guesses into facts as you do, so that the business\nmodel can be verified and measured.\nBusiness Model/Hypotheses/Tests (Figure 4.1)\nBut how do you test? Rule number 6 of the Customer Development\nManifesto says to design experiments and Rule 9 says to do it with speed,\ntempo and fast cycle time. So the first step in running a test of your business\nmodel hypotheses is to design simple pass/fail experiments for each test.\nNext you run the tests, and then you gather the data and not only try to learn\nsomething from the test but also try to gain some insight. The\nHypotheses/Experiment/Test/Insight loop is shown in Figure 4.2 below.\nHypothesis/Design Experiment/Test/Insight (Figure 4.2)\nRegardless of whether it’s a physical or web/mobile product, Customer\nDevelopment experiments are short, simple, objective pass/fail tests. You’re\nlooking for a strong signal in the noise. The pass/fail tests give you a “good\nenough” signal to proceed.\nStart by asking yourself, “What do I want to learn?” Then ask, “What’s\nthe simplest pass/fail test I can run to learn?” Finally, think about, “How do I\ndesign a pass/fail experiment to run this simple test?”\nFor example, a Customer Relationships hypothesis for a physical\nproduct may have assumed that for every 10 sales calls three people would\nmove into active consideration of buying. The experiment might be as simple\nas making the same presentation to 30 prospects and having the experiment\n“pass” by coming away with nine or more orders or letters of intent.\nTests\nOne of the things that trips up engineering founders is thinking that these\nhypotheses tests have to be actual code, hardware or the real product. Most of\nthe time you can mock up the web page or create a demo or physical\nprototype to elicit valuable learning. Nor do the tests involve large sums of\nmoney or large amounts of time. When you get a strong “grab it out of your\nhands” on, say, from four of your first ten customers, it’s OK to stop the test\nand declare it a success. The goal is speed, learning and looking for a global\nmaximum (not a local maximum).\nWhat’s a global maximum? Let’s say you run a free trial offer for three\ndays on your great new weekend getaway website and you get 50, then 60,\nthen 80 signups in the first three days. You might say, “Wow, 80, that’s\ngreat,” and end the test. But on day four, the sun comes out. Had you run the\ntest for only two more days, you might have discovered your “global\nmaximum,” 500 signups a day. Only experience and good guesswork can tell\nyou how long to run a test, and while shorter is always better, be sure you’ve\ngiven yourself the opportunity to reach your global maximum.\nGlobal Maximum versus Local Maximum Response Rates (Figure 4.3)\nThe next steps in Phases 2 and 3 and in customer validation provide\ndetails on how to set up tests for both web/mobile and physical products.\nInsight\nThe goal of these experiments/tests is not just to collect customer data. Nor is\nit to simply get “pass” on the pass/fail experiments. And it’s not just to learn\nsomething, though we hope you will.\nIt’s something more profound, intangible and what makes\nentrepreneurship in the end still an art. It’s the fact that you’re looking past\nthe data – you’re looking for insight. Did you get thrown out of sales calls\ntime and again but you remembered someone said, “Too bad you don’t sell x,\nbecause we can use a ton of those.”\nChecklist 13: Design Tests\nGoal: Devise experiments for testing the Business Model Hypotheses\nReference: Chapter 4, Design Tests and Pass/Fail Experiments\nList key areas to learn\nDesign simplest pass/fail tests\nRun Tests\nProcess for tracking learning and insights from test results\nExit criteria:\nObjective pass/fail tests for testing Business Model Hypotheses\nProcess for tracking results\nPass/Fail tests identified\nPrepare for Customer Contacts\nThe next step in qualifying your business model hypotheses is to leave the\nsafe confines of your office and conference room and venture out to the real\nworld, where the people who will pay your bills live. Regardless of whether\nyou’re selling to large corporations or consumers at home, your friendly first\ncontacts are the people who will start your education about customers and\ntheir problems. Better yet, they may become your customers.\nStart with 50 Target Customers\nThe first step in this phase will be the hardest: contacting potential customers\nwho don’t know you, persuading them to give you some of their time, and\nlooking them in the eye.\nAt this stage, you’re less interested in big names and\ntitles or the “exactly right” consumers.\nStart by gathering a list of 50 potential customers you can test your ideas\non. Fifty names sounds like a lot, but as you’ll soon see, you’ll go through\nthem quickly. A solid discovery effort will usually involve 10 to 15 customer\nvisits a week, and getting face-to-face with 50 people will probably require\ncontacting 200 customers or more. Where do the names come from? Start\nwith the people you know directly. Next, expand the list by scouring your\ncofounders’ and employees’ address books, social-network lists (Facebook,\nGoogle+, Twitter, LinkedIn, Jigsaw, etc.). Then call in every favor possible,\nfrom friends, investors, founders, lawyers, recruiters, accountants to add\nnames to your list. Finally, use conference-attendee lists, trade media, and\nany other source you can think of.\nEven if you’re selling to businesses, right now your customers’ titles and\ntheir levels in the organization are irrelevant. And if you’re selling to\nconsumers, whether they currently have the slightest interest in your product\nor not is also inconsequential. What matters is what you will learn from them.\nAt this stage, you’re less interested in big names and titles or the “exactly\nright” consumers. You’re interested in finding people who will give you\nsome of their time and who you think even loosely fit the profile embedded\nin your customer hypotheses. (In fact, calling on high-level execs now is a\nwaste of a great lead. You really have no idea what you’re saying yet, with\nnothing more than untested guesses, and will regret making the call. Wait\nuntil your business model and story stop changing on a weekly basis.)\nWhile you’re building your contact list, simultaneously begin to develop\nan innovators list. What’s an innovator? These are the most innovative\ncompanies, departments in companies, or individuals in your field who are\nsmart, well-respected and usually out in front of a subject. For consumer\nproducts, they may be the “gadget freaks” everyone asks for advice or the\ngroup of people others look to for help spotting a trend. You’ll use this list\ntwo ways. First, you need to find and meet with the visionaries who are\nknown to “get” new ideas. Unfortunately most people view innovation as a\ndangerous virus that must be kept out of their companies, while few others\nlook forward to hearing about and understanding what’s new. The few are the\npeople to talk to. Second, your innovators list will give you a great contact\nlist of industry influencers and potential advisory board members.\nIt’s hard if you’ve never called on someone you don’t know, but it’s a\nlot easier if you carefully prepare a reference story that gets you in the door.\nDevelop a Reference Story\nThe first step in customer contacts is coming up with a reference story.\nA reference story emphasizes the problems you’re trying to solve, why\nit’s important to solve them, and the solution you’re building.\nThe story typically starts with an introduction: “Hi this is Bob at\nNewBankingProduct Inc. I was referred to you by (insert helpful reference\nname here), who said you were the smartest person in the (name your\nmarket/industry).” Now give the potential customer a reason to see you:\n“We’re starting a company to solve the long-teller-line problem, and we’re\nbuilding our new Instanteller software, but I don’t want to sell you anything. I\njust want twenty minutes of your time to understand if you have the longteller-line problem and learn how you and your company solve your own\nteller problem.”\nThe best introduction to a prospect is through a\npeer.\nWhat’s in it for your contact? “I thought you might give me some\ninsight about this problem, and in exchange I’ll be happy to tell you where\nthe technology in this industry is going.” Exhale.\nObviously, you’ll need to vary and tweak the story, but the goal remains\nthe same: get meetings scheduled (you can do this via e-mail but it’s a lot less\neffective). This may sound easy on paper, but if you aren’t a professional\nsalesperson, it can be very hard. Nobody likes calling people they don’t\nknow. First-time practitioners of customer discovery stare at the phone, walk\naround it, pick it up, and put it down without calling. But eventually you have\nto “bite the bullet” and place the calls. And you know what? There’s nothing\nmore satisfying than hearing a potential customer say, “Why, yes, that’s\nexactly the problem we have. I can spare twenty minutes to chat—why don’t\nyou come in Tuesday.” Yes!\nStart the Appointment-setting Process\nFirst, a few pointers:\nThe best introduction to a prospect, when you can manage it, is through\na peer within his or her company. For consumer products, it can be just\nas challenging—how do you get hold of someone you don’t know? But\nthe same technique can be used: a reference from someone the prospect\nknows\nStart with an introductory e-mail or LinkedIn, Twitter or Facebook\nmessage—preferably sent by whoever gave you the contact—explaining\nthe reason for the call that will follow and why the time spent in the visit\nwill provide value to the customer\nAlways start by mentioning the referral source, as in, “Steve Blank said\nI should call”\nTell them that the meeting is not a sales call and that someone said they\nwere the smartest person in the industry and you want to get their\nfeedback.\nAsk for a short amount of time: “I just need 15 minutes of your time.”\n(You’ll get more)\nDon’t talk product or features. Explain that the goal is an understanding\nof the problems or issues in the market or product category, and explain\nwhy the person’s time will be well used\nSometimes the best “meeting” is a friendlier, less “threatening” cup of\ncoffee that’s clearly intended to be an information exchange and not a\nhard-boiled sales pitch. Guests will be more likely to accept and often\nmore relaxed, receptive, and open to talking\nOne of the mistakes entrepreneurs make is\nconfusing motion with action.\nCompanies that succeed in this phase often spend an entire week setting\nup the meetings and at least several weeks conducting them. It’s a small price\nto pay when compared with the years the team will spend driving toward\nsuccess. Each founder needs to have at least 10 (yes, 10) conversations a day\nuntil you book enough meetings to fill your calendar.\nOne of the mistakes entrepreneurs make in this step is confusing motion\nwith action. Motion is a sent e-mail, a left voice-mail message or a note on\nLinkedIn. Action is a two-way conversation. So 10 conversations may\nrequire 25 e-mails, voice mails, Tweets, etc. Keep calling until the schedule’s\nbooked with three customer visits a day. Get used to being turned down, but\nalways ask, “If you’re too busy, who else should I talk to?” It’s helpful to\nkeep hit-rate statistics (were any lead sources or job titles better than others?).\nThe same approach works for consumer products. As a rule of thumb, every\n50 calls should yield five to 10 visits. Before going out, plan the call from\nicebreaker to conclusion and rehearse.\nBuild a master calendar of booked appointments and assign members of\nthe founding team to each one. Geography, proximity and logistics challenge\nthe time efficiency. Research the company in advance to personalize the visit\nas much as possible. Don’t expect every customer to be able to react\nthoughtfully to every question or have a valid opinion on every aspect of the\nneed or problem. Instead, plan to assemble a mosaic of answers that\nultimately provide depth of feedback on every question on your list.\nChecklist 14: Prepare For Customer Contacts\nGoal: Get meetings scheduled with potential customers to understand the\ncustomer problem and whether the company’s proposed solution solves it\nReference: Chapter 5, Prepare for Customer Contacts\nList of 50 initial target customers\nDevelop a Reference story\nCraft an Introductory email\nContact initiated\nBuild a master calendar of booked appointments\nExpand the list of contacts\nCreate the innovators’ list\nCreate the initial list of advisory board candidates\nExit criteria:\nMeetings arranged targeted number of potential customers\nPass/Fail tests identified\nTest Understanding of the Problem and Assess Its\nImportance\nWith your customer meetings scheduled, it’s time to get out of the building\nand measure how serious and important the customer problems, passions or\nneeds are in the customer’s eyes. Are you solving an urgent “hair-on-fire”\nproblem or something that it would be nice to fix “someday?” Obviously, one\nof those suggests a far larger market opportunity.\nDevelop a Problem Presentation\nIn contrast with a product presentation, a problem presentation is designed to\nelicit information from customers. The presentation summarizes your\nhypotheses about customers’ problems and about how they’re solving the\nproblem today. It also offers some potential solutions, to test whether your\nassumptions are correct. This presentation is your icebreaker when you meet\ncustomers. (You may have to do this for each “side” in multi-sided markets,\nwhere the issues differ for buyers and sellers/users and payers.)\nIn contrast with a product presentation, a problem\npresentation is designed to elicit information from\ncustomers.\nDeveloping a problem presentation is easy. Your hypotheses about\ncustomer problems and their solutions were articulated in the value\nproposition hypothesis in Phase 1. Put these assumptions into slides.\nConsider something as simple as a single-slide presentation (see Figure 4.4)\nlisting the perceived problems first, the current solutions in Column 2, and\nyour proposed solution in Column 3.\nCustomer Problem Presentation (Figure 4.4)\nHopefully you’ll never get to use your presentation. Your goal is to get\nthe customers to talk, not you. This is the biggest idea in Customer\nDevelopment. The real goal of the problem presentation is for you to capture\nyour hypotheses about what you believe, but unlike an existing company, you\naren’t trying to convince anyone you’re right. You’re there to listen.\nGet the customers to talk, not you.\nThe Problem Meeting\nWhen you have the slide done, be prepared to present it using a whiteboard or\nsimply one-on-one across a table. Remember, though, that “presenting” in\nthis context really means inviting the customers’ responses. So, after\ndescribing your assumed list of problems in column 1, pause and ask the\ncustomers what they think the problems are, whether you’re missing any\nproblems, how they would rank the problems, and which are must-solve\nrather than nice-to-solve. You’ve hit the jackpot when the customer tells you\nthey will do anything to solve the problem.\nThe presentation must encourage discussion. Most people enter a\nmeeting room expecting to be “talked at,” especially in a first meeting with\nsomeone viewed as a potential vendor. When using slides, at least half the\nslides should create a “pause” that requires more than a yes/no response.\nBetter still, use no slides and perhaps a printed handout or two instead. These\nkinds of questions stimulate a problem discussion:\nWe think these are the five top problems facing the industry. How would\nyou rank them as they affect your company?\nIf you have three major problems to solve (in this area) in the year\nahead, what are they and why do they make the “top three”?\nHow does your company evaluate new products? (price? performance?\nfeatures?)\nWhat if a customer tells you that the issues you thought were important\nreally aren’t? Instead of feeling as if you’ve failed, realize you’ve just\nobtained great data. While it may not be what you wanted to hear, it’s\nwonderful to have that knowledge early on.\nSummarize this discussion by asking two questions: “What’s the biggest\npain in how you work? If you could wave a magic wand and change anything\nabout what you do, what would it be?” (These are the “IPO questions.”\nUnderstand the answers to these questions and your startup is going public.)\nCasually ask, “How much does this problem cost you (in terms of lost\nrevenue, lost customers, lost time, frustration, etc.)?” You’ll use this number\nlater in the customer validation step, when you develop a presentation.\nUnderstand How They Solve the Problem Today\nWith agreement on the problems and their cost, you can display Column 2 (in\nFigure 4.4), the solutions available today. Again you pause, ask the customers\nwhat they think the solutions to the problem are, whether you’re missing any\nproblems, and how they would rank the viability of the existing solutions.\nWhat you’re looking for here is an understanding of how customers solve this\nproblem today or how they think others do. If the problem is painful or\nimportant enough, you’ll get interesting answers. While you’re at it, another\ncritical piece of information is who shares these problems. Are there other\nconsumers who do x or y? Other people in the same company? Others in an\nindustry? Others with the same title? A set of people with common problems\nequals a common value proposition. This means you can describe the value\nof your product in a message that’s understood across a broad audience.\n“If you could wave a magic wand and change\nanything, what would it be?”\nFinally, for both corporate and consumer products, introduce the\ncompany’s solution (not a set of features but only the big idea) in Column 3.\nPause and watch the customers’ reactions. Do they even understand what the\nwords mean? Is the solution evident enough that they say, “If you could do\nthat, all my problems would be solved?” Alternatively, do they say, “What do\nyou mean?” Then do you have to explain it for 20 minutes and they still don’t\nunderstand? Ask how your solution compares with the current solutions you\njust discussed. Once again, the point is not to deliver a sales pitch but to get\ntheir reaction and a healthy discussion.\nOf course, what you learn from these discussions depends on what sticks\nafter the meeting. Responses tend to blur together, so it’s helpful to take\nhypothesis briefs along on visits. Look at the entire set. Before each call,\nshorten the list to “What are the three most important things I need to learn in\nthe call?” Get at least those three questions covered. Take notes and listen\nactively. Over time, as response to key issues crystallizes, begin to ask\ndifferent questions.\nThink about ending a meeting with “Who are the three other smart\npeople like you I should talk to?” I want my contact list to always be getting\nbigger. Another favorite closer is “What is it that I should have asked you?”\nThe answers have been known to keep meetings running for another halfhour.\nThe Problem Meeting in a New Market\nUsing the problem presentation can be daunting in new markets, which lack\ncontext, since it’s tough to solicit feedback on a problem folks don’t\nrecognize or realize they have. The classic (and tired) example of this is the\nlikelihood that if Henry Ford had asked customers what they wanted, they\nwould have said, “A faster horse.” Unlike an existing market where there are\ncustomers who can name the basis of competition (features, price, needs, etc.)\nnew markets have no existing customers. But that doesn’t mean you should\nsit in your office and simply build your vision.\nAlways ask,\n“What should I have asked?”\nProblem meetings in new markets use the problem–and-solution\npresentation to inform an entrepreneur’s vision, not to specify features. In a\nnew market, customer responses should provide additional insight, not\nnumerical data. In a new market one of the warning signs that you may be\nhallucinating rather than have a vision is if you can’t find any earlyvangelists\nwho share your vision. (They share it by giving you an order, not a pat on the\nback.)\nCollect Information on Everything\nBefore concluding the visit, ask yourself, “What else can I learn?” Never\nleave meetings, even bad ones, without learning three new things. I ask a\nseries of seemingly innocuous questions. What conferences or trade shows do\nthey attend? What blogs, journals, and magazines do they read? Who’s the\nbest salesperson they’ve ever seen? How do they hear about new ideas?\nImagine asking these questions across 100 or more contacts and you can see\nyourself building a “customer order of battle”—a deep understanding of who\nthey are and how to reach them. Keep detailed records of all responses.\nDevelop a Customer Discovery Scorecard.\nAvoid the Big-Company Meeting Trap\nThere’s a special trap to watch out for when you call on big companies,\nwhere employees tend to attend meetings en masse, Clearly detrimental to\nopen, freewheeling conversations with potential earlyvangelists that could\nhave been rich in feedback. To ensure maximum feedback at big companies:\nArrange one-on-one meetings with key targets (decision-makers, key\ninfluencers, and heavy users) before and/or after group meetings to\ngather individual feedback\nTry to get the “big boss” alone since others are often reluctant to speak\nup when he or she is in the meeting. They may also defer to him or her,\nminimizing important “outlier” feedback\nA possible approach to discovery with a big company is to bring your\nentire startup “brain trust” to a peer-to-peer meeting with the company’s\nleadership so the two senior teams have a forum to discuss the\nopportunity\nAlways state the goal upfront: we want a better understanding of how a\ntrendsetter or industry leader confronts problems or challenges that\nmight be solved by a new product (flattery never hurts)\nAmalgamate and “Score” the Customer Data\nWhen the first “out of the building” problem phase is complete, summarize\nthe data, in a Customer Discovery Scorecard (Figure 4.5). The scorecard\nprovides a sense of whether there’s enough customer excitement around the\nproduct to warrant further forward motion. The analysis should help gauge\nwhether the right people were contacted and whether enough earlyvangelist\ncandidates were identified. “Weight” the data to adjust the findings’\nimportance to company goals. In the process, some customers will be pursued\naggressively, others will be put on “hold” until the product becomes\nmainstream, and some will be abandoned.\nDon’t lose or ignore outlier comments. They may lead to new features or\ndifferent ways of selling or provide other suggested iterations for the business\nmodel. Look at both the summary data and specific or unusual comments\nfrom prospective customers.\nSample Customer Discovery Scorecard (Figure 4.5)\nThe scorecard rates six customers’ views on a new industrial battery,\nusing a score of 1 to 3, with 3 being highest. Rating checkpoints in this\nexample include:\n“Excited” and “urgent need” are self-explanatory.\n“Business-Impact” reflects how important or transformative will the\nadoption of this technology be on the customer? Nice to have? Impacts a\ndivision? Changes their entire business model?\n“Work-around,\n” indicates that the customer has been solving the problem\nwith a home-grown solution.\n“120 day” indicates how likely it is that the customer will sign a purchase\norder in 120 days. Since this hypothetical company requires more funding\nwithin six months, 120-day purchases are double-weighted (thus the 120×2\ncolumn).\n“Key decider,\n” indicating that the conversation was with an empowered\nbuyer.\nThe actual scorecard might have tens, hundreds or thousands of lines,\nbut on this sample scorecard we’re just looking at a handful of customers. If\nthe six are representative, our sample scorecard suggests the need for more\ndiscovery data. Why? Only Customers A and B reflect both excitement, and\nan urgent need, for the product. Of those, only Customer A is an\nearlyvangelist candidate, experiencing enough pain to attempt a work-around\nsolution. Even then, Customer A’s score is only 18 of a potential 21 points,\nand he reflects uncertainty about buying the product within 120 days, neither\nof which are signs of a rabid enthusiasm for the product. Some other\nobservations:\nCustomer A is likely to buy within the 120-day goal period\nForget Customer E for now, since excitement is poor despite the urgent\nneed. And conversations with a decision-maker are a long way off, as is\na buying decision\nApproach Customer C in hopes of meeting the decision-maker, and\nrequest another meeting with the decision-maker at Customer B\nDon’t abandon any of the customers, since each acknowledges some\nsignificant need for the product. Those not selected for further discovery\nshould be kept on ice and made part of the pipeline at a later date. Take\nyour time calling back Customer F\nDevelop a viable mechanism that properly weights\nthe key issues.\nThe average scores are also informative. The high “urgent need” average\nsuggests there may be non-product problems, such as an inadequate problem\npresentation, ROI justification, or the need to reach higher-level folks during\ncustomer discovery in general, since everyone recognizes a need for the\nproduct but few are eager to buy. The poor 120-day score reinforces the\nlikelihood that product benefits weren’t described well and that the\nprice/value message was unclear, or perhaps the price/value itself needs a\npivot or an iteration.\nEvery product has a different set of variables to consider and score in\naggregating and assessing the customer discovery findings. The key is to\ndevelop a viable mechanism that properly weights the key issues. Once the\nscores are impartially applied, discuss the system’s accuracy. If it’s accurate,\nscore the entire set of customers. Don’t forget to study the outlier comments.\nChecklist 15: Test The Problem And Assess Its\nImportance\nGoal: Measure seriousness and importance of the customer problem or need\nas the customer sees it\nReference: Chapter 4, Test Understand the Problem and Assess its\nImportance\nDevelop the “Problem” presentation\nPerceived Problem\nCurrent Solution\nStartup’s proposed solution\nTop 3 things to learn at each customer call\nTwo presentations for multi-sided markets\nPresentation rehearsed?\nCreate a Report card for collecting data\nPerceived problems, ranked by customer\nCost\nCurrent solution\nStartup’s solution\nReferrals\nCreate a Scorecard for results\nExit criteria:\nProblem presentation developed and rehearsed\nReport card for collecting data at each call\nScorecard for results\nPass/Fail tests identified\nGain Customer Understanding\nIn addition to checking your assumptions about customer problems, you need\nto validate your hypotheses about how customers actually spend their days,\nspend their money and get their jobs done. Whether the product is for\ncorporate customers, a social network, or a new consumer electronic device,\nyou want to understand in detail how their lives or jobs work, how their\nwork/design flow happens and how they currently solve the problem or fill\nthe need.\nIf they’re in a business, are their jobs done in isolation? If not, how do\nthey interact with other departments? What other products do they use? Is the\nproblem they’ve identified limited to them, or do others in the company share\nit? Is it possible to quantify the impact (dollars, time, costs, etc.) across the\nentire organization? The same questions work for consumers. Will they use\nthe product themselves? Does it depend on others or their friends and family\nusing it?\nYou’ll want to check your assumptions about whether and how much\npeople will pay for your solution. What would make customers change the\nway they do things? Price? Features? A new standard? If the customer’s eyes\nhaven’t glazed over yet, dip your toe into the hypothetical product spec. “If\nyou had a product like this (describe yours in conceptual terms), what\npercentage of your time could be spent using the product? How missioncritical is it? Would it solve the pain mentioned earlier? What would be the\nbarriers to adopting a product like this?” (If you’re a founder who has been in\nthe industry you’re entering, you may already be a domain expert and already\nbring deep customer understanding.)\nSince someday soon your startup will have to create demand to reach\nthese customers, use this opportunity to find out how they learn about new\nproducts. Who are the visionaries in the press/analyst/blogging community\nwhom they read? Whom they respect?\nFinally, never pass up an opportunity to spot talent. Can these customers\nbe helpful in the future? For the next round of conversations? For an advisory\nboard? As a paying customer? To refer you to other customers?\nYour goal, after enough of these customer conversations, is to be able to\nstand up in front of your company and say, “Here were our hypotheses about\nour customers, their problems, and how they worked. Now here’s what\nthey’re saying their issues really are, and this is how they really spend their\nday.”\nYour goal is to understand the customer in depth. What does in depth\nmean? It’s impossible to know their jobs as well as they do, but you should\nbe so thoroughly conversant with what truly matters to customers that you\ncan discuss their issues convincingly.\nIn business-to-business companies, experience the customer at work, or\nat the very least observe it. Spend a day behind a cash register, at a trade\nshow, or at a conference the target customers are likely to attend. Buy lots of\ncoffees and have lots of casual conversations. Your goal should be to know\nthe customer you’re pursuing, and every aspect of his or her business, so\ndeeply and intimately that they start to think of you and talk to you as if you\nwere “one of them.”\nKnow the customer you’re pursuing so deeply they\nthink you’re “one of them.”\nChecklist 16: Gain Customer Understanding\nGoal: In-depth understanding of potential customers\nReference: Chapter 4, Customer Discovery, Get Out of the Building to Test\nthe Problem. Do People Care?\nResearch and Customer interviews\nHow customers’ money and time are spent\nCurrent workflow\nPain or need\nCurrent solution and cost\nHow workflow would change with startup’s product\nCustomer publications\nCustomer influencers\nSpend a day doing what customers do\nAttend customer events\nReport card for recording information learned\nProcess for analyzing data collected\nExit criteria:\nIn-depth understanding of customers, what they read, who they listen\nto, how they work, spend leisure time and money\nPass/Fail tests identified\nCapture Market Knowledge\nWith a better customer understanding under your belt, it’s time to round out\nyour understanding of the overall marketplace. Meet with companies in\nadjacent markets, industry analysts, people in the press, and other key\ninfluencers. Go to industry trade shows and conferences to understand the\nshape and direction of the market you’re about to create.\nWhen you start a company, you should have some vague notion of what\ncompanies are in adjacent markets or are part of the infrastructure or\necosystem of your business. Through your own contacts, but usually through\nintroductions, take peers out to lunch. In exchange, gather information—not\ncompetitive information but answers to questions such as: What are the\nindustry trends? What are key unresolved customer needs? Who are the key\nplayers in this market? What should I read? Whom should I know? What\nshould I ask? What customers should I call on?\nWhat will motivate these people to meet? Most won’t do it out of the\ngoodness of their hearts; rather, they’ll meet to make a “trade.” They’ll learn\nabout a key problem and its solution in exchange for providing their industry\nknowledge and insights.\nJust as you did with your problem presentation to potential customers,\ndon’t present or sell—just listen and learn. Spend the time to take a few of\nthe friendliest customers to lunch and ask them who they see as potential\ncompetitors, both internally and externally. Who do they think has similar\nproducts? Who else is an innovator in this space? Has this solution been tried\nelsewhere in their company? Is anyone else inside their company trying to\nbuild this product? It’s amazing how much you can learn from the people\nwho will eventually buy your product.\nAsk the same questions of peers in adjacent markets, and after practicing\non them, try to make contact with the key industry influencers and\nrecommenders listed in Phase 1 and ask them the same set of questions.\nIt’s a rare company that doesn’t have a website. These provide a treasure\ntrove of information, literally available at one’s fingertips, about competitors,\nthe market, and the industry where the company plans to compete. Start by\nGoogling the problem and reading perhaps the first few hundred links. Be as\nspecific as possible in selection of search terms, and try several different\nsearches for maximum information. This effort leads to a wealth of market\ninformation, including news about the category, companies providing\nsolutions, key blogs and websites addressing the industry, industry experts,\nand consultants.\nTake competitors to lunch.\nThen dive deeper into each competitor uncovered in the initial search.\nFind out not only what they say about themselves but also what others say\nabout them—positive and negative. Try to discern key product features and\nselling points, which help differentiate the new offering from competition.\nCollect industry and competitive press releases, studies, and reports, and\nfollow the thread to the consultants, researchers or pundits who wrote them to\nsee what else they’ve said.\nNext, start gathering quantitative market data. More than likely, Wall\nStreet analysts issue reports on the market or adjacent markets. Get copies of\nall of these reports. More important, actually read them. Understand what the\nanalysts believe are the trends, the players, business models, and key metrics.\nFinally, industry conferences and trade shows are invaluable and\nessential. Never say, “I’m too busy to attend.” Attend at least two key\nconferences or trade shows (the important ones picked in Phase 1). Not only\ndo they provide great trinkets, but conferences and trade shows are the prime\nareas for both talent-and trend-spotting. Ask usual questions about trends and\nplayers, but this time accomplish a few things that can’t happen anywhere\nelse. Get demos of competitive and adjacent products. Get your hands on the\nproducts themselves, get competitors’ literature, talk to their salespeople, and\ngenerally immerse yourself in your new industry. Attend as many conference\nsessions as possible, listening to others describe their products. What are their\nvisions of the future, and how do they compare with your own newly\ndeveloped value proposition?\nAfter testing the customer problem (or need) and gaining a complete\nunderstanding of the customer, it’s time to expose the product itself to\npotential customers for the first time. Not to sell to them but to get their\nfeedback. Before doing so, be sure to update the hypotheses and business\nmodel wherever changes are indicated.\nChecklist 17: Capture Market Knowledge,\nTraffic/Competitive\nGoal: Gain understanding of overall market\nReference: Chapter 4, Capture Market Knowledge\nMeet with peers in adjacent markets, industry analysts, journalists,\nother key influencers\nIndustry trends\nKey unresolved customer needs\nKey players\nMust-read/Must-ask/Must-meet\nPotential competitors/Innovators in the space\nResearch!\nTrends\nKey players/Influencers\nBusiness models\nKey metrics\nConstruct a Competitive grid\nConstruct a Market map\nAttend Industry events\nDemos\nHands-on time with competitive and adjacent products\nSpot talent, trends\nExit criteria:\nIn-depth understanding of the overall market, its trends, players, current\nproducts and vision for growth\nPass/Fail tests identified\n\nCHAPTER 5\nCustomer Discovery, Phase Three: “Get\nOut of the Building” and Test the Product\nSolution\nSTEVE’S PHONE RANG AND THE VOICE ON THE end said, “You don’t know me\nbut I just read your book and think I need your help.” That was the day we\ngot to know one of the most innovative startups within a “Fortune 500”\ncorporation (#6): General Electric’s Energy Storage division.\nPrescott Logan, the unit’s brand-new general manager, recognized that\nhis unit’s new sodium industrial battery was a disruptive innovation, which\nGE traditionally does well, but aimed at a market where the end users were\nunknowns. Logan realized his division looked more like a multimillion-dollar\nstartup with all the usual startup uncertainty, but located within a huge,\nexecution-oriented company. He needed a framework or architecture to help\nhis team deal with a “white space” market and apply startup “search” and\ncustomer discovery principles at a company known for “six sigma”\nexecution.\nEnergy Storage was buying capital equipment, breaking ground on a\nmassive factory, and out making sales calls—in full “execute” mode, the way\nmost big companies work—based on a ton of diligence and an external\nconsultant’s 30,000-foot view of the opportunity, but not likely having had\nenough face-to-face end user conversations.\nSoon after the call, the customer-facing team came to the ranch to map a\ncustomer discovery plan. They had a clear fix on the “customer problem”\n(life cycle, wider range of operating temperatures, etc.), and knew how they’d\ntake the well-vetted innovation from the lab to manufacturing, but one\nquestion remained. Who would buy it in volume, and why? In two days of\nbrainstorming, the Customer Development process offered GE the following\ninitial observations:\nThe new GE battery should serve dozens of market segments, not just\nthe two they’d selected: backup systems for cell towers and data centers\nThey needed to look many more customers in the eye to validate the\nmarket selection\nProduct managers were spending too much time in Schenectady, N.Y.\nheadquarters, where there were no customers and no answers.\nCustomers were outside the building\nWith an existing global customer base, GE had plenty of access to\npotential customers\nThey needed to find earlyvangelists, essential when launching new\ntechnology like GE’s, and determine the earlyvangelists’ characteristics\nas well as how to find them\nThey needed a formal process to review what discovery data they’d\ngathered to date to understand how different the value proposition was\nfor each market segment—and where the opportunities might be greatest\nfor a high-performance, more expensive alternative to lead-acid\nindustrial batteries (far bigger versions of the one in your car)\nWhat other business model “boxes” would customers like them to\nchange in order to sign a purchase order? The GE team uncovered\nseveral including changing the product features themselves, making the\nproduct somewhat configurable, and offering leasing and other\nalternative financing models\nPrescott grasped Customer Development faster and better than anyone\nwe had ever seen. The Energy Storage division was a startup. All the rules for\nmanaging and launching product line extensions—business plans and\nrevenue models—didn’t work. They needed instead to first test their basic\nhypotheses about their business model.\nLeaving the ranch, Prescott and team joined the million-mile club as\nthey flew across the U.S. and to Asia, Africa and the Middle East, meeting\nface-to-face with dozens of prospects, suspects, and influentials to explore\nmultiple potential new markets and applications. They did their best to leave\nPowerPoint decks behind, and listen to customers’ problems, needs, and\nfrustrations with the battery status quo. Unscripted, open-ended discussions\nwith a wide range of prospects were conducted worldwide to listen about\nhow prospects bought their batteries, how often they used them, and the\noperating conditions. In one target market, Prescott actually relocated a top\ncustomer development team member and his family to India and said “don’t\ncome home til you get a purchase order signed,” which he did, learning\nimmensely about how his target segment customers might use the battery and\n—more important—how they’d evaluate and buy.\nTalking to a wide range of prospects, the team soon found more market\nsegments, and even though they aren’t huge businesses yet, they’re promising\nbecause the product’s unique capabilities “unlock” far more value for users in\ncertain segments. For example, the battery’s small footprint and\nenvironmental friendliness make it a far better choice as a backup to\ncomputer systems in high-rise office buildings, where real estate is expensive\nand the floors often can’t hold the weight of massive lead-acid battery arrays.\nIn one case, they found an architect who said “I don’t really care what it\ncosts, I want it.”– the precise definition of an earlyvangelist!\nIt was customer discovery and early validation on steroids, driven by a\npassionate entrepreneurial CEO (though Jeff Immelt has that particular title)\nwho’d stand up against any valley startup leader. Prescott’s boss, GE VP\nTina Donikowski, provided cover while the team executed the thorough,\nhonest search process any startup must have, rather than the six sigma\nexecution drills that made GE so famous. And Prescott chose people who\ndidn’t fit the typical big company mold: “white space” thinkers who lived for\nthe search and embrace the unknown.\nWhile the jury is still out, and the business is a long way from its huge\nrevenue goals, this team of passionate entrepreneurs hiding in a “Fortune 6”\ncompany have just about posted a “sold out” sign on the factory for its first\nsix months of operation. We think that sign has a good chance of being up for\na while.\n“Test the Solution:” an Overview\nThe previous phase tested the customer problem or need and explored\ncustomers’ passion for it, This phase tests whether the solution to that\nproblem—the value proposition—gets customers’ enthusiastic enough to\nbuy/use the product. This phase has five steps:\nUpdate the business model and team—a Pivot or proceed point\nCreate the product solution presentation (physical channel) or the high\nfidelity MVP test (web/mobile)\nTest the “product solution” (physical channel) or begin to measure\ncustomer behavior (web/mobile channel)\nYet again, update the business model and team\nIdentify the first advisory board members\nUpdate the Business Model and Team (a Pivot-orProceed Point)\nWith a far deeper understanding of customers and their problems, it’s time\nfor an important pivot-or-proceed pause in the Customer Development\nprocess. While some startups have already pivoted, every entrepreneur should\nuse this step to take a pause and review the collection of customer feedback\nabout the problem and its importance. Those findings, coupled with extensive\ncustomer, industry, and competitive research, have taught the company a\ngreat deal about its customers, how they work or play, the market, and the\nproblem the company has been founded to solve. This learning makes it a\nnear-certainty that at least some business model hypotheses need to change.\n(When a substantial change is made to one or more business model\nhypotheses, it’s a pivot.)\nStart this phase by gathering as much of the company management as\npossible (not just the founders and VPs but directors and managers as well),\nalong with key investors, for the pivot-or-proceed review. Share everything\nthat’s been learned, with a focus on customer feedback regarding the\nimportance or severity of the problem or need—the potential product/market\nfit. The group also reviews new findings that may affect hypotheses or\nassumptions made in Phase 1, adjusting them where appropriate. These can\noften include the value proposition or product specs, customer segments,\npricing, and revenue model assumptions.\nStart by Assembling the Data\nBefore the meeting, the Customer Development team gathers all the customer\ndata and builds a work-flow map of the prototypical customer. At the meeting\nitself, the spokesperson for the team diagrams and describes how customers\nactually do their job and whom they interact with. This provides a reality\ncheck of the customer hypotheses. Keep diagramming and drawing until it’s\neasy to explain how customers’ businesses and lives work today, including\nhow they spend their time and money. Compare this description with the\ninitial hypotheses. (While corporate customers may have more formal\norganization to diagram, a consumer will have more external influencers to\ntrack.)\nWith the customer work flow and interactions fully described, dive into\nthe real news. What problems did customers say they have? How painful are\nthese problems? Where on the “problem scale” are the customers you\ninterviewed? How are they solving these problems today? Draw the customer\nworkflow with and without your product. Is the difference dramatic? Did\ncustomers say they would pay for that difference? In general, what did you\nlearn about customers’ problems? What were the biggest surprises? What\nwere the biggest disappointments?\nQuestion Everything\nOnce the Customer Development team has presented its findings, the fun\nbegins. You can now ask the most difficult question. Given all that’s been\nlearned from talking to customers, how well do the preliminary product specs\nsolve their problems? Dead on? Somewhat? Not exactly? If the answer is\n“somewhat” or “not exactly,” this meeting becomes a soul-searching,\ncompany-building exercise. Is it because the right people weren’t\ninterviewed? Failed to talk to enough people? Because nobody asked the\nright questions? This assessment is critical because of a fundamental\nassumption of the Customer Development model: before changing the\nproduct, keep looking for customer enthusiasm. If and only if no customers\ncan be found for the product, discuss changing the feature list.\nPeople who talk to customers tend to collect a list of features that, if\nadded, will get one additional customer to buy. Soon there’s a 10-page\nfeature list just for selling 10 customers. In contrast, in Customer\nDevelopment the goal is to have a single-paragraph feature list that can be\nsold to thousands of customers.\nWhat if everyone believes you’re talking to the right customers but the\nfeedback says you’re building the wrong product? Something has to change.\nDon’t continue building the product and think miracles will happen. Either\nget back outside the building and find a different set of customers who will\nbuy the product or consider changing the features.\nAssuming the product is at least a partial fit for customers’ problems,\ncontinue examining the product assumptions and specs. Based on customer\nfeedback, review the Phase 1 feature list. Prioritize the features in terms of\ntheir importance to the customer. Can the Customer Development team\nmatch each feature to a customer problem? If not, why not? While figuring\nout what features to ship is important, knowing which features don’t matter is\nequally important. Which features did customers not care about? Can any\nfeatures on the product spec be deleted or deferred? Remember, in a startup\nthe Customer Development team isn’t supposed to be adding features; it’s\nsupposed to be finding out the minimum feature set, based on input from\nvisionary customers.\nNext, review and get agreement on the delivery schedule, again revising\nPhase 1 assumptions as necessary. As noted earlier, visionary customers,\nparticularly in corporations, will be buying into the entire vision, not just the\nMVP. They will need to hear what the company plans to deliver over the next\n18 months.\nEarlyvangelists need to hear about the 18-month\nproduct roadmap.\nFinally, as a group, review the other Phase 1 hypotheses. (Now it’s clear\nwhy writing them all down was important.) Given all the feedback from\ncustomers, which of the four market types is the company in? Why is it\ndifferent? What are its competitive advantages? Do the initial pricing and\ndelivery channel assumptions hold up? What was learned about influencers?\nPivot or Proceed\nRegardless of channel, this step concludes with the first of many pivot-orproceed discussions. Management and investors affirm they’re confident\nthey’re the company has uncovered a problem in which a sizable enough\nuniverse of customers is clearly eager to solve. If not, it’s time to rethink the\nvalue proposition and attack a more severe problem or a need of greater\ninterest or urgency to a larger customer universe. If the universe is eager to\nsolve the problem, the group moves on to present its potential product\nsolution to customers.\n...summarizing customer findings is not an\naccounting problem.\nOne last thought: Collecting and summarizing customer findings is not\nan accounting problem. You aren’t simply adding up the number of\nresponses. You’re looking for learning, meaning and insight in the data. And\nmore than anything, you’re looking for hordes of customers who will try to\nrip the product right out of your hands so they can have it before their friends\nor competitors.\nChecklist 18: Update The Business Model And\nTeam\nGoal: Prepare to assess whether to move ahead or pivot\nReference: Chapters 3,4, 5, Customer Discovery\nAssemble the Customer Data\nBuild a Workflow map of prototypical customer\nCustomer workflow with and without new product or app\nDetailed findings from customer interviews\nProblems customers have\nPain level\nHow the problems are being solved\nWhat was learned\nBiggest surprises/Biggest disappointments\nAssessment of data\nHow well preliminary product specs solve customers’ problem\nProduct/market fit\nReview and prioritize features list\nFeatures matched to customer problem\nCustomer interest/enthusiasm quantified\nReview the Phase 1 hypotheses\nUpdate the Business Model Canvas\nUpdate the 18-month delivery schedule\nPivot-or-proceed discussion\nExit criteria\nDetermine whether the company has uncovered a problem that many\ncustomers are eager to solve, or if the Value Proposition works\nUpdate the Business Model Canvas\nPass/Fail tests identified\nCreate the Product “Solution” Presentation\nOnce product development and Customer Development teams agree on the\nrevised hypotheses, the next step is to assemble the first product “solution”\npresentation. This presentation is emphatically not the presentation used for\nfundraising or recruiting. Nor is it the problem presentation just used with\ncustomers in Phase 2. Toss those slides out and start over. This presentation\ntests the revised assumptions about the product itself. It’s a solution\npresentation confirming that the product fits a serious customer problem or\nneed. Customers confirm their interest by expressing interest in buying or\nusing the product.\nThe presentation should cover the five (no more!) key product features\nand the problems they solve. Include a story about “life before the product”\nand “life after the product” where appropriate. Draw the customer’s work\nflow or the consumer’s day “before” and “after” the product. Leave out all\nthe marketing, positioning and fluff. Close with the product vision (from the\nvalue proposition “vision” hypothesis) at least 18 months out.\nLeave plenty of room and “cues” in the presentation to prompt customer\nfeedback. Rehearse. Remember that this is still not “selling,” but an effort to\nuncover whether the product is salable. Learn enough so that when selling\nbegins, the team is confident that customers will be eager to buy.\nHere’s the product/solution presentation outline:\nReview the problem. Start by reminding the audience about problems the\nproduct is designed to solve and why a solution is important if not urgent.\nPause here to re-validate the importance of solving the problem. As\nsurprises emerge, return to Phase 2.\nDescribe the solution. Demonstrate the product if possible; even sketches\nor prototypes of key concepts or features help customers understand.\nPause to probe for a reaction. Do customers agree it solves the problem?\nDraw the customer work flow before and after the new product. Validate\nthe “before and after” work flow. Describe who else in the customer’s\norganization the solution might affect.\nUnderstand the value equation: Some customers will pay almost anything\nfor a product that solves a serious business problem. Sometimes, thirdparty features enhance value when added. Keep pricing discussions fluid,\nand identify the key values a prospect sees. Watch for pleasant upside\npricing opportunities.\nThe product/ “solution” presentation should take no more than 20\nminutes. In the next step, you’ll present it to customers and listen to their\nfeedback.\nIf an MVP doesn’t exist, a demo or prototype will make the discussion\nmore effective. This is why fashion designers make one actual dress and\nshow it to buyers, car companies build one “concept car” to display, and why\ntoy companies make one or two nonworking Styrofoam prototypes of the\nlatest toys and games to show buyers. The more an MVP looks, feels, and\nworks like the product, the more informed the customers’ reactions will be.\nObviously, this is far easier in some product categories than others. (Try\nprototyping the new 787 jetliner, for example.) Equally obvious: the closer\nthe MVP is to a touchable, usable prototype, the fewer slides are needed for\nthe solution presentation.\nChecklist 19: The Product/ “Solution” Presentation\nGoal: Develop a solution presentation for use with customers to confirm the\nproduct solves a serious customer problem or fills an important need\nReference: Chapter 6, Create the Product/Solution Presentation\nDevelop a Solution-oriented presentation\nReview problem\nDescribe product (five key features)\nInsert multiple prompts for customer feedback\nNo marketing or positioning information\nDraw the Customer workflow diagram\nBefore the product\nAfter the product\nProduct future 18 months out\nDevelop a Demo or Prototype where possible\nKeep a Scorecard to track customers’ reaction\nExit criteria:\nDetailed presentation that sets out the customer program, shows the\nstartup’s solution and invites additional customer feedback\nPass/Fail tests identified\nTest the Product Solution with the Customer\nWith the solution presentation complete, decide which customers to visit.\nEarlier, your “problem discovery” visits should have reached at least 50\npotential customers. Try to deliver this solution presentation to every\nqualified prospect who heard the problem presentation. Expand the original\nset of customer contacts to include at least 10 potential customers for\ncomplex products like enterprise software, and many more for consumer\nproducts. These new contacts keep the momentum going and lay the\ngroundwork for selling something during customer validation.\nThis time, test previous assumptions about the titles of people who will\nmake the purchasing decision. Return to the customer types described earlier,\nand interview several of each type to get a full spectrum of feedback. Find\nprospective saboteurs wherever possible, with an eye to spotting patterns in\ntheir job titles. With the call list in hand, create an introductory e-mail,\nreference story and sales script, and then get out of the building.\nSolution Presentation\nBegin by reminding the audience what problem the product is designed to\nsolve and why the company believes solving the problem is important. With\nagreement on the problem and its significance, it’s finally time for the\nsolution presentation you developed earlier (most entrepreneurs have wanted\nto do this since Day One, so you should be ready by now). Demonstrate the\nproduct, rough prototype or MVP wherever possible for maximum impact.\nNow it’s time to listen. After hearing the solution description, how do\ncustomers think it solves their problem. Do they think it’s different? Do they\nthink the product is creating a new market, or is it a better version of an\nexisting product (and, if so, better in what way)? Or do they yawn or shrug?\nCheck other hypotheses. What do customers think about the proposed\nrevenue model and pricing? What are comparable prices for this kind of\nproduct?\nUse a post-visit “report card” to consistently record feedback.\nRemember, this isn’t a sales call, but an exploration to see whether customers\nbelieve the product is a strong solution to an important problem—and to\ngauge whether the solution is strong enough to get them to buy when the\nproduct’s ready.\n“Show Me the Money” Questions\nWhen talking to visionary customers about big-ticket b-to-b products, ask\nseveral questions to test adoption. “Would you deploy our software\nenterprise-wide if it were free?” Tests the seriousness of a potential customer.\nIf the customer isn’t ready to deploy the software even for free, you’re\nobviously talking to the wrong person. When a customer is willing to\nvisualize the pain of rolling out your product, ask how they would deploy it,\nhow many users would use it, what groups would get it first, the criteria\nthey’d use to measure its success, and so on. By the end of this visualization\nexercise, potential customers are sometimes mentally installing and\ndeploying your software.\nBe sure to get to the “who has the money” question. There’s nothing\nmore frustrating than having a series of great customer meetings for months\nonly to find out very late in the sales cycle that no department has the budget\nor that new capital purchases are made on an annual cycle that just closed.\nAsk if a current budget exists for products like this and which department or\nindividual would have the budget. The information will be critical when\nassembling the sales roadmap.\nPricing Questions\nExplore the pricing boundaries. Ask, “Would you pay $1 million for our\nsoftware?” The answer is usually instructive. Suppose customers said, “we\ncouldn’t see paying more than $250,000 for the first set of applications.” In\ntheir minds, they had already bought the product and the bill just came due.\nThe first number out of their mouths was usually what they had in their\nimmediate budget or the initial purchase price.\nSample Customer Discovery Report Card (Figure 5.1)\nOnce you get a first number, ask, “How much more would you expect to\npay for professional services (the customization and installation)?” Most of\nthe time they’ll say that that cost was included in their budget number, but\nsome add to that figure. Then push and see whether they would spend those\nextra dollars every year or ask, “What would we have to do to get you to\nspend twice that? Three times that?”\nAfter a few of these customer exercises, you’ll understand your average\nselling price and sense the lifetime value of a customer.\nChannel Questions\nWhat about distribution? Test these assumptions by asking customers how\nthey would most likely buy. Retail store? Online? Direct sales? Distributor?\nFrom there, as time allows, explore how marketing might reach the customer\nwith questions like:\nIf you were interested in a product like this, how would you find out\nabout it?\nHow do you find out about other new products like this?\nDo you ask others for their opinions before buying? If so, whom?\nDo you or your staff go to trade shows?\nWhat industry-specific magazines or journals do you read? What\nbusiness publications?\nFor consumer products, ask what general-interest publications,\nnewspapers, bloggers or websites would best connect with the consumer\n“Get/Keep/Grow Questions”\nNext, probe the customers’ product acquisition process. For corporate\nproducts, ask, “How does your company buy products like this? Walk me\nthrough the approval cycle. Who is involved?” Software entrepreneurs should\nbe forewarned that many Fortune 500 companies, too often burned,\nautomatically reject software offerings from startups that haven’t reached\ntheir fifth birthday. If it’s a consumer product, understand the buying process.\nIs this an impulse buy? Do they buy only known brands? Items advertised on\nTV?\nPresentation Tips\nA few tips to smooth the way:\nDon’t attempt to ask every question in each solution interview. Some\ncustomers will know more about one aspect of the product than another\nOpt for one-on-one discussions over large-group meetings. You’ll get\nmore detail and more thoughtful opinions\nConvert the discussions into a rough sales pipeline based on people’s\ninterest in buying\nIt’s better to find and stop work on or delete unnecessary features than\nfeatures to add new ones. The goal is an MVP now!\nIt’s optimistic to expect customers to share all this information at the\nfirst presentation or to expect every customer to know enough to answer\nevery question. Try to accumulate answers to all the questions over the\ncourse of all the customer visits. Completing this phase signifies a complete\nunderstanding of customers’ problems and a solid grip on their level of\nproduct interest.\nMeet the Channel\nIf any form of indirect sales channel will be involved, one more group needs\nto see the solution presentation your potential channel partners needs to see.\nWhile it’s too early to sign up channel partners with formal commitments,\nmeet them now and understand what it would take to get them to sell the\nproduct.\nWhat do channel partners need to hear or see from early customers?\nHow do customers access their channel?\nIs it the kind of product they’d sell proactively?\nDo they want articles in the business press, product reviews and\ncustomers calling them and asking for the product?\nDo they seek financial inducements such as shelf-stocking fees,\nguaranteed returns or—worse—a “guaranteed sale” policy that allows\nthem to return unsold merchandise?\nChannel partners won’t magically know how to position or price the\nnew product. For products in an existing market, it’s easy to tell them, “It’s\nlike that other one you sell but faster.” For re-segmented and new markets,\nindirect channels have a harder time understanding how to position products.\nSpend time understanding channel partners’ motivations and incentives, and\nsoliciting their feedback about features, pricing, sales opportunities and more.\nUnderstand each channel partner’s business model. Why? There’s no\nway to understand how much channel partners should order or how much\nthey should charge customers unless their business model is clear. See how\nother companies do it. Take other executives to lunch and ask about margins\nand discounts. The worst that could happen is that they won’t disclose the\ninformation. Keeping all this in mind, assemble a channel/service partner\npresentation and stress what’s in it for the partner. Partners are usually\nfondest of things on which they make more than just margin—some like\nproducts that require installation, service or ongoing supplies, such as paper\nand toner for copiers. Finally, hit the streets to start a dialogue and learn\nabout their business:\nHow do companies establish a relationship with them?\nDo they hear their customers asking for a product like yours?\nHow does a potential partner make money? (By project? By hour? By\nreselling software?)\nHow does their business model compare with others in their business?\nWhat is the minimum dollar size for a transaction of interest to them?\nUnderstand each channel partner’s business model well enough to draw\nit on a whiteboard\nChecklist 20: Test The Product Solution With The\nCustomer\nGoal: Gauge whether customers believe the product is a strong solution to an\nimportant problem and if they’ll buy it\nReference: Chapter 5, Test the Product Solution with the Customer\nPrepare for the Meetings\nIntroductory e-mail\nReference story\nScript\nConduct Customer Interviews\nCustomers who heard first “problem” presentation\nTargets on expanded set of contacts\nSeveral of each customer type\nUse demo, prototype or MVP to describe product\nIndirect sales – potential channel partners\nDevelop a Customer report card to record feedback\nProduct and features\nIntended market\nPricing\nDistribution\nReferrals\nThank-you notes\nExit criteria\nSolid understanding of customers’ problems\nRobust customer interest in product\nFor indirect sales, be able to draw each channel partner’s business\nmodel\nPass/Fail tests identified\nUpdate the Business Model Again\n(Another Pivot-or-Proceed Point)\nHere you’ll update the business model to reflect the latest round of customer\ndiscovery “solution” findings and how they do or don’t affect the elements of\nyour business model. Think of it as a “tune up,” since you’ll conduct a\nthorough business model review in the next phase.\nYour focus here is totally about customers’ enthusiasm for the product,\nand the conversation should be about pass/fail test results, not opinions.\nYour business model should undergo regular\nupdates.\nLook for Massive Customer Enthusiasm\nThis is the time to remember that lukewarm response to any product or the\nproblem it solves is a serious, red-alert danger signal that calls for an\niteration or a pivot rather than an automatic step forward into customer\nvalidation. Discuss the percentages as well as the number of customers\nvisited who express rabid or significant enthusiasm for the product and high\nconfidence that it solves an important business problem or fills a high-priority\nconsumer need. What’s the team’s honest appraisal of how many customers\nwould run out and buy it immediately? How many would tell all their friends\nor associates? Did any or, better, many declare the best possible vote of\nconfidence, “I don’t care if it’s not complete or perfect—I want it now”? Start\nthe conversation by sorting customer reactions into the following main\ncategories:\nCategory 1: Customers unequivocally love the product, and no changes\nare needed.\nCategory 2: Customers like the product, but we’ve heard consistently that\nthey want this or that additional feature at launch.\nCategory 3: Customers can understand the product after a long\nexplanation, but no one was jumping over the table to buy it.\nCategory 4: Customers don’t see much of a need for the product.\nIf most of the customers fall into Category 1, congratulations! If the\nbusiness model components “add up,” as reviewed in the next step, it may\nwell be time move on to customer validation.\nRegardless of channel, customer discovery sought a market for the\nproduct as originally spec’ed. The most dangerous customer responses lie in\nCategory 2: “We need more features.” As emphasized earlier, knowing which\nfeatures don’t matter is as important as knowing which features to ship first.\nBalance customer reactions with development time, since it may take much\nmore product development effort to earn a convincing Category 1 answer.\nWhy? Because the joke is true: “Normal people believe if it isn’t broke, it\ndoesn’t need to be fixed. Engineers believe if it isn’t broke, it doesn’t have\nenough features yet.”\nThe natural instinct of Engineering is to keep adding features. But\ncustomer discovery is a race to get the MVP into paying customers’ hands as\nquickly as possible, so fewer features or an MVP that’s just “good enough”\nare far better than losing a month or even a week’s worth of customer\nfeedback. Ask whether any features can be deferred. Let early customers help\ndetermine which features and functionality to add and in what sequence.\nListening carefully to the right customers delivers a product strategy with a\nhigh likelihood of success in any channel.\nAnswers in Categories 3 and 4—customers aren’t jumping over the table\nor don’t see a need—are typical during a first round of customer discovery.\nAt a minimum, they require serious thought and probably a pivot that\ninvolves restarting Phase 1 from the beginning rather than continuing forward\non a death march to failure. This makes for a challenging board meeting but\nis often a critical turning point for investors and company alike. For\ntechnology products, lukewarm customer response can indicate a profound\nproblem, usually characterized as the lack of product/market fit: not enough\nof a market for the product or a lack of robust demand for a product in a vast\nmarket.\nRepackaging the Product—A Pivot Strategy\nOther issues are sometimes referred to as positioning but more accurately\ndescribed as “product repackaging.” Product repackaging is a problem most\ntechnology startups have to deal with at some point. A technology-driven\nstartup’s first product is usually determined by the founding product\ndevelopment team. Often the product development team has a perfect feel for\nwhat the customers’ needs are and how the customers want to buy the\nproduct. But most of the time they don’t. If they haven’t been intimately\nconnected to the customer, the initial product configuration needs further\nrefinement by the Customer Development team. While the core technology\nmight be spot-on, its match for customer needs or purchase preferences can\nbe off. A single monolithic software package might be too expensive or too\ncomplex to sell that way. Technology repackaging might solve the problem\nby reconfiguring the product features. Perhaps it can be sold as modules, or\nas a subscription service, or with increasingly featured versions, without\nrequiring Product Development to completely reengineer the product. This\nproblem must be caught and dealt with in customer discovery or it may affect\nthe company’s ability to survive.\nUpdate the Business Model Canvas Again\nRegardless of channel, this series of analyses and discussions will almost\ncertainly affect some of the business model hypotheses. Most likely to be\naffected is the value proposition, since this first “solution discovery” effort\nhelps shed light on whether people think the product solves the problem in a\nway that compels them to buy. When it doesn’t, the value proposition is the\nmost likely suspect for adjustment, whether features are added or subtracted\nas a result.\nCustomer segments should be reviewed, since the product may have\nresonated well with some segments and not others. If, for example, the\nproduct generates excitement only among a subset of the intended market\n(men, not women; managers, not staff people), that discovery will affect the\nrevenue stream hypothesis as well. The team will conduct a thorough review\nof the business model in the next phase, so this is best thought of as a tune-up\nthat updates the model to reflect the latest round of customer discovery\n“solution” findings.\nChecklist 21: Update The Business Model And\nTeam\nGoal: Prepare to assess whether to move ahead or pivot\nReference: Chapters 3,4, 5, Customer Discovery\nAssemble the Customer Data\nBuild a Workflow map of prototypical customer\nCustomer workflow with and without new product or app\nDetailed findings from customer interviews\nProblems customers have\nPain level\nHow the problems are being solved\nWhat was learned\nBiggest surprises/Biggest disappointments\nAssessment of data\nHow well preliminary product specs solve customers’ problem\nProduct/market fit\nReview and prioritize features list\nFeatures matched to customer problem\nCustomer interest/enthusiasm quantified\nReview the Phase 1 hypotheses\nUpdate the Business Model Canvas\nUpdate the 18-month delivery schedule\nPivot-or-proceed discussion\nExit criteria\nDetermine whether the company has uncovered a problem that many\ncustomers are eager to solve, or if the Value Proposition works\nUpdate the Business Model Canvas\nPass/Fail tests identified\nIdentify First Advisory Board Members\nAs good as any founding team may be, invaluable people outside the\ncompany who can’t be hired full time will often be willing to help in an\nadvisory capacity. These advisers can help solve technical problems,\nintroduce key customers, provide domain-specific knowledge, and share\nbusiness expertise and wisdom. Throughout customer discovery, when\nmeeting customers and analysts, prospecting for advisory board members\nshould always be in the back of everyone’s minds.\nProduct Development should engage some advisers for specific help in\ndesigning and building the product, and a business mentor, someone who’s\nbeen through the startup grind before, may also be helpful. One or two\ncustomer voices typically stand out from the crowd. Engage these people by\nasking them for advice, taking them to lunch or dinner, and seeing if they’re\ninterested in helping.

Have we found a product/market fit? Is there sizable demand for solving\nthe problem, and does the product fill that demand well in the\ncustomers’ eyes?\n2. Who are our customers and how do we reach them? Do we understand\nthe demography and archetypes of our key target customers and enough\nabout their behavior to know how to find them cost-effectively?\n3. Can we make money and grow the company? Can we grow predictably\nand large enough to make a great company?\nIf your answer to this analysis is “proceed,” remember that it’s still not\ntime to launch. This go/no-go decision answers only one question: do we\nhave enough confidence in customers’ enthusiasm and the product/market fit\nto proceed to customer validation and see if our business model scales by five\ntimes, 10 times or more? It’s often frustrating to entrepreneurs who make the\n“go” decision, since they’re rarin’ to get out and start doing and selling. After\nall, that’s what entrepreneurs do. It’s also a dangerous trap: customer\nvalidation accelerates spending, which—if unsuccessful—can cost you your\njob, your equity, or both. (As we’ve said, this process isn’t easy.)\nIs This Business Worth Doing? (Figure 6.1)\nBring your team and investors to a “full stop” to answer the questions\nabove. At a bare minimum, whether you Pivot or Proceed is the subject of an\nentire board meeting. Generally this assessment forces at least one return trip\nback to the start of the discovery process. This is the norm! (It’s far better to\nfind out now, before more years of 100-hour workweeks are invested.)\nHave We Found a Product/Market Fit?\nProduct/market fit has three components:\nIs the problem or need that’s addressed urgent or vital to lots of\ncustomers—i.e., is there a market? (Replace “lots” with a real “pass/fail”\nnumber.)\nDoes your product solve the problem or fill the need at a price customers\nwill gladly pay? (Insert real number from business model, of course.)\nAre there enough customers (insert number) “out there” to deliver a\nsizable (insert number) business opportunity?\nThis checkpoint is important enough to take these questions one at a\ntime. (If you’re uncertain or want more data, there’s a deeper exploration of\nthis set of questions at the end of Chapter 11.)\nAre you attacking a serious problem or filling a\ncompelling need?\nThis question should have been thoroughly probed directly with customers\nboth online and, more important, face-to-face. Have you consistently heard\nenthusiastic responses like “This is a high-priority problem (or need) near the\ntop of my list?” If they add comments like “I’d pay anything to solve this\nproblem” or “My patchwork solution isn’t good enough,” even better. Probe\nonly for a high level of consistent enthusiasm. That defines a market\nopportunity.\nKey questions to review and discuss:\nDid your customers have friends or colleagues with similar problems or\nneeds, and did they think the problem was important enough to discuss it\nwith, or refer it to, their friends or coworkers?\nWere many of the customers you met attempting home-grown or\nworkaround solutions to the problem your product will solve?\nDid most customers rate the problem or need’s severity at 8, 9, or 10 on\na scale of 10?\nDid most customers rate the pain caused by the problem at or near 5 on a\nscale of 5?\nReview the before-and-after customer work-flow diagram.\nWas the difference dramatic after buying the product?\nWere customers palpably excited?\nDid customers say they would pay for that difference?\nDoes your product solve the problem or fill the need\nfor your customers?\nReview all the customer feedback report cards, summaries, and analysis—\nthere should be quite a pile of it. Here again, as with validating the problem\nquestion, be sure there’s robust enthusiasm for the product, even in its MVP\nform. Look for comments like “I have to have this now” or “Everyone I know\nwill want one” or “When can I get it?” Lukewarm or average enthusiasm\nseldom delivers scalable startups. Be objective and park entrepreneurial\nenthusiasm at the door.\nKey questions to review and discuss:\nDid the minimum viable product generate significant “buy” or “engage”\nenthusiasm?\nWas the product exciting enough to stimulate significant customer\nreferrals? Did those referred customers buy or engage at an encouraging\nrate?\nDid the long-term product vision generate highly positive customer\nfeedback?\nIs the latest product-features-and-benefits hypothesis still appropriate\nand profitable?\nDid the long-term product-delivery schedule generate purchase\nenthusiasm?\nAlso review the delivery schedule, revising assumptions as necessary.\nCustomers are buying into the entire vision, not just the MVP, and need to\nhear how and when the product will evolve.\nAre there Enough Customers to Deliver a Sizable\nBusiness Opportunity?\nDid customers verify that they’d buy at the level you expected? Did any\ncompetitive or other data emerge pointing to larger or smaller market share?\nReview your initial TAM (total addressable market) and SAM (serviceable\nmarket) hypotheses and compare those estimates with what customers\nactually said. How much do they buy, how often, and are their friends or\ncolleagues similarly inclined? Check findings against market knowledge and\ncompetitive analysis data gathered in Phase 2.\nKey questions to review and discuss:\nHave you validated the TAM and SAM for your market?\nIs the market size as you expected, and is it verified by customer\nfeedback and industry data?\nIs the market growing significantly, with strong growth prospects?\nDo customer conversations verify that they’ll buy repeatedly and refer\nothers to do the same?\nDid any unexpected competitive threats emerge?\nThe hard question to answer here is how many customers are “enough.”\nThis question must be answered by founders and investors together, with\neveryone on the proverbial “same page” about longer-term goals for the\ncompany and whether results to date point toward achieving those results.\nThese results differ widely by channel and product type. A few\ngeneralizations:\nEnterprise software: Three or four earlyvangelists showing very strong\ninterest might well be enough, provided that the team has at least as\nmany more enthusiastic prospects in the pipeline. Where possible,\ncustomers should come from multiple segments, and few or no segments\nshould be far behind the others in terms of interest in the product\nCapital equipment: The “three or four” enterprise software rule applies\nhere, too, as a rule, but a closer look at results of customer discovery\nwith a broader range of customers is helpful. Are most prospects\ninterested in the product largely as spec’ed, or does everyone want some\nform of customization? Do discovery results point to a robust pipeline,\nacknowledging that the sales cycle for capital goods can be quite lengthy\nConsumer products: Whether it’s a new skateboard or a flat-screen TV,\nmore than a handful of earlyvangelist customers is almost certainly\nrequired—perhaps 20 or 30 or more. It’s also important to establish\nserious interest in the channel where you expect to sell the product. If 15\npeople want to buy your skateboard, that’s probably not convincing\nenough for the Walmart buyer, for example\nWeb/mobile applications: Since customer discovery efforts should reach\nat least several thousand prospective users or customers, a web/mobile\napp should almost certainly activate at least 100 apps or downloads to\nsay it’s seen “enough” customer response. You should also watch the\npercentages, to be sure the conversion rate is encouraging\nSocial networks and “network effect” startups: These should probably\nattract at least 500 if not 1,000 active, engaged users to be able say\nthey’ve attracted “enough.” If the site or app is free or a freemium (freeto-paid), that number should be at least three times—preferably five\ntimes—larger, since it’s so much easier for a user to say “yes” to\nsomething that’s free. Monitor the activation rate, and look as well at the\npercentage of users who are returning regularly—say, three times a\nweek—since they’re not only an indication of customer volume but also\npoint to the customers’ quality and engagement\nIf the team is talking to the right customers but feedback says the\nproduct is wrong, something has to change. Reassess your customer segments\nand get back outside to find a different set of customers, or consider changing\nthe features, product configuration, pricing, or other business model\nelements.\nChecklist 23: Verify Product/Market Fit\nGoal: Verify that the company has identified a serious problem, has a\nproduct that will address that problem and that there are enough customers\nwilling to pay for that product.\nReference: Chapter 6, Verify Product/Market Fit\nAssessment: Serious problem or important need?\nNumber of customers with the problem\nHow customers rated problem\nWhether customers attempted home-grown solutions\nWorkflow diagram with and without new product\nAssessment: Does product addresses product or need?\nCustomer feedback reviewed\nAmount of customer enthusiasm for product\nReferral rate\nAssessment: Are there enough customers?\nMarket size, now and anticipated\nCustomer feedback\nCompetitive threats\nExit criteria:\nVerify sizeable demand for solving the problem\nVerify that the product fills the demand well in the customers’ eyes\nUpdate the Business Model Canvas\nPass/Fail tests identified\nDo We Know Who Our Customers Are and How to\nReach Them?\nThe previous step assures that there are customers “out there” who want your\nproduct. But do you know how to find them and sell to them with an\naffordable marketing or “get customers” budget? This verification step starts\nby ensuring that you know “what a customer looks like.”\nCan you draw a customer archetype for each of your key customer\nsegments? Does it clearly point you to places where you can find them?\nCan you draw a day in the life of a customer so you know how to pitch\nthe product to him?\nDid some segments respond better, faster, or with larger orders than\nothers?\nDid any new segments emerge, or should any be eliminated?\nDo customers recognize big improvements in a “day in the life” of\nusers?\nDo you know what your customers read, trade shows they attend, gurus\nthey follow, and where they turn for new product information?\nCan you draw your channel map, showing how the product moves from\nyour startup to its end user, along with the costs and marketing/sales\nroles of each step in the sales channel?\nTry to measure your “get customers” cost and response rates objectively.\nReview the real, “all in” costs (including staff time, overhead, whatever) of\nactivating or selling, say, 50 customers. When you add up all the costs (not\njust the ad or AdWords costs themselves, for example), are you still confident\nof your ability to get lots more customers at roughly the same cost per\ncustomer?\nLook beyond your total “Get” budget to identify which programs were\nmost cost-effective, and do some homework to be sure that if, for example,\nyou quintupled your e-mail marketing budget, results would quintuple as\nwell. This is the time to figure out how much you really need to spend to get\none (or 50) good customer(s), since you’re about to head to customer\nvalidation, where spending will increase by a factor of 10 if not more!\nIf a significant amount of customer feedback has given you high\nconfidence in all these answers, there’s one more step—determining whether\nyou can consistently acquire customers at the costs outlined in your “Get”\nhypotheses. Your early tests of the Get programs should have given you a\ngood sense of that, so review the data collected. Don’t worry if the costs are a\nlittle high, since you’ll be optimizing those programs as you ramp them up\nduring validation.\nBe sure to update the business model based on any changes in customer\nacquisition costs discovered in this review, since they’re often the largest\ncosts your startup will confront.\nChecklist 24: Verify Who Customers Are and How\nto Reach Them\nGoal: Verify that company knows its customers and how to reach them\nReference: Chapter 6, Verify Who Customers Are\nCustomer archetypes\nDay in a Life of a Customer\nCustomer responses assessed\nCustomer behaviors, influencers assessed\nChannel map\nCosts assessed for each step of moving product\nUpdated business model reflecting changes in customer acquisition\ncosts\nExit criteria:\nDetailed understanding of who the customers are, how to reach them\nand what it costs to get them\nUpdate the Business Model Canvas\nPass/Fail tests identified\nCan We Make Money and Grow the Company?\nAssemble Revenue Model Data\nBy this point, the team has assembled a massive amount of hard data about\npricing, revenue, costs and acquisition and marketing costs, among others.\nThe data needs to be verified, with any gaps filled in along the way, which\nmay entail returning to learn more in further customer, channel, or product\ndevelopment discussions. The most important hard data to review includes:\nsummary of customer report cards, indicating potential sales revenue\nexpectations over time\nmarket size estimates\nchannel cost and revenue potential summaries\npricing plan\ncustomer acquisition costs\ndetailed information about the industry, the customers, and their\nbehavior\ncompetitive product and pricing information\nCombine this data to create an accurate net revenue forecast for at least\nthe next four quarters of the company’s existence—the customer validation\nphase—and, if possible, another year beyond that. This shouldn’t be a\nprecise, to-the-penny estimate by any means. Instead, it’s more of a rough\n“gut check” to be sure that the company will emerge from customer\nvalidation as a growing, profitable business. Take a close look at Figure 6.2, a\nhypothetical analysis of a company selling both via its own website and\nthrough a physical channel. Average cost of customer acquisition is 40% of\nrevenue in this example. The data assembly is a four-part process:\n1. Compute the “best estimate” of total gross revenue the company will\nreceive directly from customers, quarter by quarter. Review results of\ncustomer discovery report cards and “get customers” program tests as\nwell as market size estimates to estimate the company’s direct revenue\nfrom customers quarter by quarter.\n2. Next, compute the amount of channel revenue (other than direct revenue\nfor sales to end users, from which the company receives 100 percent).\nReview the channel costs (margin, rep fees, promotional costs, etc.) and\ndeduct them from channel revenues.\n3. Add the net channel revenue to the total direct revenue by quarter to\nfigure total company revenue. Deduct quarterly operating costs from the\nrevenue.\n4. Compute all the costs of acquiring customers, recognizing that they will\nmost certainly change quarter by quarter, both as the company spends\nmore money on its “get customers” effort and as it acquires customers\nmore cost-effectively.\nSample Financial Analysis (Figure 6.2)\nThe computation should deliver a reasonable rough estimate of the\ncompany’s revenue expectations across its next four (or, preferably, eight)\nquarters. Consider developing this entire exercise three different ways, using\na “good/better/ best” approach that delivers three different forecasts or\nbusiness cases: high, best guess, and worst case.\nThis analysis all by itself may stop the pivot-or-proceed process in its\ntracks, as it often does, if the computation shows the company running out of\nmoney within the year. The spreadsheet is a simple example of a rough “cash\nburn” computation that should be enough to send any smart founder back\nthrough the discovery and validation processes, considering that the company\nruns out of money 90 days from moving forward.\nLooking at an analysis like this, the founders and investors should be\nhighly nervous about proceeding to spend nearly $2 million on customer\ncreation activities. The startup in this example has several options:\nRaise another few hundred thousand dollars immediately in order just to\nsurvive the year ahead\nReduce the spending on operations or customer acquisition costs\nCut staff or reduce founder salaries until break-even is achieved\nWithout taking any of these steps, the company will clearly not survive,\nand it must return to refine its business model.\nKey questions to review and discuss:\nHave you translated market and market share findings into potential unit\nsales and revenue?\nHave you validated your pricing model with customers?\nAre volume, demand, and purchase-frequency hypotheses validated?\nWere any unanticipated channel costs uncovered, such as sales reps’\nsalaries or promotional fees?\nIf the market is multi-sided, have all costs of generating “buy”-side\nrevenue been estimated?\nDoes this rough forecast point to a scalable, profitable business with\nsubstantial exit value?\nChecklist 25: Verify Can We Make Money\nGoal: Determine whether the company can be profitable\nReference: Chapter 6, Customer Discovery, Verify Business Model/Pivot or\nProceed\nRevenue Model Data\nSummary of customer report cards, indicating potential sales revenue\nover time\nMarket size estimates\nDetailed information about the industry, customers, their behavior\nCompetitive product and pricing information\nChannel cost and revenue potential summaries\nPricing plan\nCustomer acquisition costs\nAccurate net revenue forecast for the next 4-8 quarters done three\nways (good/better/best)\nDirect revenue\nNet channel revenue\nTotal revenue\nAcquisition costs\nBasic operating costs\nCash burn\nCash at quarter end, by quarter\nExit criteria:\nReasonable rough estimate of the company’s revenue expectations\nacross next four-eight quarters\nUpdate your business model canvas\nPivot or Proceed?\nThis is either the beginning of the end or, more likely, just the end of the\nbeginning. It’s where you must acknowledge that an estimated one idea in\nthousands morphs into a scalable, profitable big company with an exit value\nof $100 million or more. The company has put a stake in the ground with a\nseries of hypotheses and tested its assumptions. Potential customers have\nvalidated the product, and a base of prospects has evolved. And all the\nlearning is captured in writing in the updated business model canvas and its\nsupporting hypothesis documents. Now it’s time to honestly assess if the\nmodified hypotheses provide a sound foundation for moving forward—not to\nlaunch—to a larger-scale test in customer validation.\nSummary questions to review and discuss:\nHave we identified a problem lots of customers will eagerly pay to have\nsolved?\nDoes our product solve these needs distinctively, cost-effectively and\nprofitably?\nIf so, do we have a sizable market and a viable, scalable and profitable\nbusiness model?\nCan we draw a day in the life of our customer before and after purchase\nof our product?\nCan we create an organizational chart of users, buyers and channels?\nThe hardest question is simple and needs an honest answer: do the\ncustomer discovery findings point to a big enough market that’s hungry for\nthe product? This is often a painful question and, sadly, more often than not\nleads back almost to the beginning of customer discovery. While it’s a defeat\nof sorts, it’s far better to confront this question honestly and candidly,\nensuring that the business model, properly executed, points to a repeatable,\nscalable, profitable business opportunity. Without one, the company faces a\npainful road to ignominy.\nExhausting as the customer discovery process is, it often requires\nmultiple iterations to fully understand the market and discover customers\nwho can’t wait to buy. However, it’s never been easy to find the Holy Grail.\nUntil you do, take everything learned in Phases 1 through 3 to heart, modify\nthe presentations, go back to Phase 1 and do it again. Try out several markets\nand users. Does the team need to reconfigure or repackage the product\noffering? If so, modify the product presentations and go back to Phase 3\n(solution presentation) and do it again.\nIf the team votes “all systems go,” there are two more steps to complete\nbefore taking a deep breath and moving forward into customer validation.\nDetermine the Validation Checkpoints\nIt’s wonderful to have lots of soft, fuzzy metrics of success, but they seldom\ndeliver success to startups. Be sure that every hypothesis has a clear,\nmeasurable “validation checkpoint” and that those checkpoints tie into the\nbusiness model. A few examples of the kinds of checkpoints to test in the\ncustomer validation phase:\nPhysical channel/business-to-business checkpoint examples:\nWe can close a sale in three meetings\nOne of six prospects will buy if we get to talk to VPs of finance\nCustomers will expand the number of users of our service by 25 percent\nafter six months\nCustomers will place an average of two orders per month\nOn to Customer Validation? Congratulations!\nIf you’ve gotten this far, you’ve changed your hypotheses many times. Some\nwere iterations, others were pivots. One of the best techniques to see how far\nyou’ve come is to show the canvases as a series of snapshots over time. You\ncan do this by putting them up on the wall or clicking through a series of\nPowerPoint slides. Either way, this visual presentation of the hypotheses and\nyour tests to turn those guesses into hard, cold facts, is the final step in\ndetermining whether it’s time to move on to the next of the four steps,\ncustomer validation.\nIf it’s time to move to the next step, congratulations! This is a major\nachievement and warrants celebration. Customer discovery is the most\nchallenging, powerful step you’ll encounter in Customer Development:\ndefining a product, an offer, a channel and pricing for a product that\nconsumers are eager to buy. Hold on to all the information collected from\ncustomer interviews for use throughout the phases of customer validation,\nwhen actual selling will develop a sales roadmap for the company.\nCustomer discovery is an exhausting, sometimes-frustrating process.\nHowever, it’s the foundation of Customer Development and thus the\nfoundation of a successful, scalable business. The checklists found\nthroughout this book recap the phases of this step, the goals of each phase,\nand the deliverables proving that the goals have been met. With that done,\ntake a well-earned vacation or a long weekend to celebrate. You’ll need to\nrest up before moving on to customer validation.\nChecklist 26: Verify Business Model – Pivot or\nProceed\nGoal: Assess whether the modified hypotheses provide a solid foundation for\nmoving forward to larger-scale testing in Customer Validation\nReference: Chapter 6, Customer Discovery, Verify Business Model/Pivot or\nProceed\nModified hypotheses assessed\nProblem/need identified\nProduct solves product/need\nSizeable market\nViable, scalable, profitable business model\nDay in the Life of the Customer, with and without product\nOrganizational chart of users, buyers and channels\nClear, measurable Validation Checkpoints identified\nExit criteria: Full, honest assessment of Customer Discovery effort:\nIs there a big enough market that’s hungry for the product?\nIII\nStep Two:\nCustomer Validation\nChapter 7:\nIntroduction to Customer Validation\nChapter 8:\nCustomer Validation, Phase One:\n“Get Ready to Sell”\nChapter 9:\nCustomer Validation, Phase Two:\n“Get Out of the Building and Sell!”\nChapter 10:\nCustomer Validation, Phase Three:\nDevelop Product and Company Positioning\nChapter 11:\nCustomer Validation, Phase Four:\nThe Toughest Question of All: Pivot or Proceed?\nOverview of the Customer Validation Process\n\nCHAPTER 7\nIntroduction to Customer Validation\nAlong the journey we commonly forget its goal.\n—Friedrich Nietzsche\nE.PIPHANY’S FOUNDING HYPOTHESES WERE typically pretty straightforward\nand “investable” in the mid-1990s, when software companies were\nautomating everything from accounts payable to network security, sales force\nprocesses and even wine-cellar inventories. “Why not automate the marketing\ndepartment?” asked the founders, meeting in their modest living room. “After\nall, most of the tasks like press releases and data sheets and customer letters\nare repeatable processes.” Venture capital was raised and the company began\nto build its product based on the founders’ vision.\nHowever, the company’s initial idea of who the customer was and the\nproblem they wanted to solve was just plain wrong. The company’s later\nsuccess was due to the four passionate entrepreneurs’ willingness to listen to\ncustomers and to the three painful pivots driven by customer feedback.\nThe Browser Breakthrough\nDuring the ’90s, large corporations acquired different software applications to\nautomate each part of their enterprise—finance, customer support,\nmanufacturing, and sales among them. But the data these applications\ncollected were accessed via reporting tools from the IT organization. More\nimportant, the data existed in “virtual silos,” with each functional system\nwalled off from the other. The finance system didn’t talk to the sales system,\nwhich didn’t know that the manufacturing system even existed. Queries like\n“Compare the sales data of green dresses versus blue ones with current\ninventory for each by store, and contrast the gross margin by region to\ncalculate discounts” were virtually impossible to answer to because they\nrequired combining data from three incompatible applications. As a result, it\ncould often take days or even weeks to get a simple inventory-detail report.\nE.piphany’s then-radical notion was to provide managers\nanytime/anywhere drill-downs and analysis in real time, without IT, through\na revolutionary new technology called a web browser. One of the company’s\nkey hypotheses was that the product should be a great fit for companies with\nlots of customers, tons of data on each one, and a recurring need for fast new\ndata-driven, microsegmented marketing campaigns.\nAn Epiphany at E.piphany\nEarly on, E.piphany assembled an advisory board. A key adviser was the VP\nof database marketing at Schwab. She was incredibly generous with her time\nand said the system might work in their application. She introduced the\ncompany to five other database marketing executives, who essentially said,\n“If you get a system working at Schwab, we’ll have to buy one as well.” You\ncouldn’t get much better than that. E.piphany had found its first\nearlyvangelist and first market.\nBut each time Schwab’s people looked at the system’s technical details,\nthey politely said our product was missing a key feature for database\nmarketing. It took two meetings before the founders realized they understood\nher problem, all right, but the solution—the underlying database schema of\nthe software—was missing the most important feature for solving it. It didn’t\ninclude “householding,” and without this feature, she could never buy the\nE.piphany system. (Householding, well-known among database marketers,\nrecognizes that two or more people at the same physical address live together\nand, in Schwab’s case, often invest together. This feature was crucial to\ndirect-marketers who didn’t want to send multiple or differing ads to the\nsame address.) And no amount of sales and marketing hand-waving was\ngoing to fix the problem.\nIt was a major mistake. Until this meeting, the founders hadn’t\nunderstood the customer problem well enough to provide the correct solution.\nE.piphany’s co-founders, Ben Wegbreit and Steve Blank, joined the\nSchwab VP, and her engineering team in a deep technical discussion of what\nthe software needed to do for Schwab’s business and what was needed. Ben\nasked five or 10 questions, everybody nodded and the meeting ended. On the\nlong ride back to E.piphany’s living-room office, Steve asked, “Ben, how do\nwe solve Schwab’s problem?”\nAfter a moment of silence, he replied, “Show them page 6 of our\nproduct spec.”\n“What do you mean page 6? Our spec only has five pages!”\nBen looked at Steve and smiled. “Not anymore.”\nThey had just pivoted the product and refined the minimum feature set.\nE.piphany’s first order from Schwab came the week after they demo’ed\nhouseholding. Other orders followed soon after. A week later, the founders\nsat down to figure out what other feature they would toss out to make room\nfor this one.\nE.piphany would go through two additional equally painful pivots\nbefore its initial public offering, but that “householding” pivot sold the\nfounders on the “power of the pivot” value.\nThe meeting and car ride from Schwab to the company headquarters\nillustrates the customer validation process every startup needs: a method for\nvalidating the business model with real customers and orders.\nCustomer validation turns hypotheses into facts about basic questions\nlike:\n• Do we understand the sales/user acquisition process?\nIs it repeatable?\nCan we prove it’s repeatable? (If our business model is single-sided\ncommerce, the only acceptable proof is enough full-price orders.)\nCan we get these orders/users with the current product?\n• Have we tested sales and distribution channels?\n• Are we confident we can scale orders/users into a profitable business?\n• Have we correctly positioned the product and the company?\nThe Customer Validation Philosophy\nCustomer validation attempts to “test sell” at every stage. It runs a continuing\nseries of quantitative pass/fail tests to determine whether there’s strong\nenough product/market fit to justify scaling sales and marketing spending.\nMost of your testing effort will be asking people to give you an order or\nengage with your app or website. At this point, you’re testing the entire\nbusiness model, not its individual components, even as you learn more details\nabout some, like price or channel.\nJust as customer discovery was disorienting for experienced marketers,\nthe customer validation process turns the world upside down for experienced\nsalespeople and, in particular, those with sales responsibility. All the rules\nsales executives learned while selling in physical channels at large companies\nare not applicable to startups. In fact, they’re positively detrimental. It’s not\nall about the launch party!\nIn the customer validation step, you are not going to hire and staff a\nsales team. You are not going to execute to a sales plan or “the sales\nstrategy.” The reality is that you don’t know enough yet to do any of these\nthings. At the end of customer discovery, you have in hand firm hypotheses\nabout who will buy, why they will buy, and at what price they will buy. But\nuntil those hypotheses are validated—with customer orders—they’re all little\nmore than educated guesses, even with the work invested to develop them.\nFrom Business Model Canvas to the Sales Roadmap\nIn customer discovery you tested some of the hypotheses of your business\nmodel:\nValue proposition: You affirmed it with a few dozen to a few hundred\npeople\nCustomer segments: You have a hypothesis about customer archetypes\nCustomer relationships: You tested several “get, keep and grow”\nactivities\nChannel: You understand your key channel partners, and some have\nexpressed interest\nRevenue model: The company has an idea of how to price its offering\nA sales roadmap uses all you’ve learned from customer discovery to\nguide the creation of a sales funnel specifically for your company. It answers:\nWho influences a sale? Who recommends a sale?\nWho is the decision-maker? Who is the economic buyer? The saboteur?\nWhere is the budget for purchasing the type of product you’re selling?\nHow many sales calls are needed to make one sale?\nHow long does an average sale take from beginning to end?\nWhat is the selling strategy? Is this a solution sale?\nIf so, what are “key customer problems?”\nWhat’s the profile of optimal visionary buyers, the earlyvangelists every\nstartup needs?\nUnless a company has proven answers to these questions, few sales will\nhappen, and those that do occur will result from heroic single-shot efforts. Of\ncourse, on some level, most sales VPs realize they lack the knowledge they\nneed to draw a detailed sales roadmap, but most believe they and their newly\nhired sales team can acquire this information while simultaneously selling\nand closing orders. This is because most executives new to startups confuse\nsearching for a business model with the execution of a known business model.\nA sales roadmap is part of the search for a business model. Only after it’s\nbuilt can it be executed. Startups can’t learn and discover while they’re busy\nexecuting. As we can see from the rubble of any number of failed startups,\nattempting to execute before you have a sales roadmap in place is pure folly.\nBuilding a Sales Roadmap Versus Building a Sales\nForce\nGiven how critical the validation step is, a CEO’s first instinct is to speed up\nthe process by spending more on customer acquisition or adding salespeople.\nThe reality is, this doesn’t speed up the validation phase. In fact, it most often\nslows it down. Instead, you’ll build a roadmap to figure out how to get\nrepeatable sales (by explicitly testing product/ market fit). Once that’s done,\nthen build a sales organization.\nDeveloping a sales roadmap is part of the search for\na business model.\nIn an existing market, customer validation may simply validate that the\nsales VP’s rolodex or contact list is relevant, and that product performance\nmetrics the company identified in customer discovery were correct. In a re-\nsegmented, clone or new market, even a rolodex of infinite size (or tripling\nthe AdWords budget) won’t substitute for a proven business model and a\ntested sales roadmap.\nFor an experienced sales or business development executive, these\nstatements about customer validation are heretical. All the actions in\nCustomer Development we consider to be mistakes are what traditional sales\nprofessionals have been trained to do. It seems counterintuitive and\ndisorienting. So let’s look more closely at why the first sales in a startup are\nso different from later-stage sales or selling in a large company.\nFounders Must Lead the Customer Validation\nTeam\nFounders who complete customer discovery often mistakenly ease up and\ndelegate customer validation activities to Sales, Business Development,\nMarketing or Product Management. This is a bad idea. Middle and junior\nmanagers aren’t likely to be good at customer validation, which requires\ncreative searching, probing, and turning on a dime—not execution of a\nrepeatable process.\nWhy must the founders lead? First, founders and only founders call the\nshots on pivoting. To do so, they must hear about flaws in the product or\nbusiness model directly from the customers. Nothing else has the same\nimpact. Anyone other than a founder who learns of a serious product or\nbusiness-plan flaw faces two challenges: he or she doesn’t have the authority\nto pivot, and he or she seldom has the courage to report bad customer\nfeedback to the founder.\nValidation Proceeds at Different Speeds in Different\nChannels\nIt takes far more time to set up visits in a physical channel with prospects in\ncellphone companies in Asia and Africa than to get customer feedback\nelectronically for a website. And more customers can be reached via\nweb/mobile channels than can ever be met face-to-face.\nMake Early Sales to Earlyvangelists\nIn customer validation you will target Earlyvangelists as your first paying\ncustomers. (If you can’t sell to them, it doesn’t get better over time.)\nConstrain Spending in Customer Validation\nA typical failure scenario for startups is premature scaling, when there are\nmore salespeople in the field burning cash than are needed while your\nbusiness model is still unproven. Or running expensive demand-creation\nactivities before you’re sure who your customers really are. Too often those\nsales people are fired and their marketing programs killed when the startup\nfaces a major pivot after scaling too early. Customer validation delays salesand-marketing hiring and spending until validation is nearly complete. This\nconstraint is central to the process, which assumes startups will fail and\niterate often. The spending constraint keeps enough cash in the bank to fund\nmultiple pivots on the road to success.\nPrioritize What Needs to be Validated\nPrioritizing the business model elements that need validating is essential at\nthe start of customer validation. Every startup business model has a zillion\nmoving parts. Validation can’t possibly measure and affirm every variable or\nthe founders will be 100 years old by the time they’re ready to scale—or,\nworse, exit—the business.\nThe business model canvas is an excellent guide here. Most startups will\nfocus on the four core elements: value proposition, customer relationships,\nchannel, and revenue model. This list works for many businesses but not all.\nMulti-sided markets need to prioritize all sides of the market. Think about the\nfive or fewer things that will make this a huge, successful business—or not.\nWhy Accountants Don’t Run Startups\nWith all the process steps involved, it’s sometimes hard to remember that the\nCustomer Development process isn’t a giant focus group. The goal is not to\nadd up all the customer feedback and vote on what features to implement.\nFounders who are artists at heart run startups—the true purpose of Customer\nDevelopment is to inform their vision. (In a new market, there’s no data at\nall!) A great entrepreneur may consider all the customer data, listen to his\ninstincts and say, “Here’s why I’m going to ignore what we just heard.”\nThe Customer Validation Philosophy, in Summary\nCustomer discovery first tested your hypotheses about the company’s\nbusiness model with a relatively tiny group of customers who were asked for\nopinions, not orders. Discovery itself didn’t deliver any proven, hard facts\nabout who would buy or how scalable the business was.\nCustomer validation goes to the next step and determines whether a\nproduct/market fit can be validated by orders or usage. It does so by further\ndeveloping the MVP as well as the company’s sales and marketing plans and\nmaterials. Then it gets founders out of the building (physically, virtually, or\nboth) to test the MVP and every other key business model hypotheses,\nincluding product features, pricing, channel, and positioning. How? By\nasking for orders (or downloads, logons, or clicks)!\nTest the MVP. How? By asking for orders.\nCustomer validation is complete when the company has answers to these\nthree questions:\n1. Can the business scale? Will a dollar spent on customer acquisition\nyield more than a dollar’s worth of incremental revenue, page views,\ndownloads or clicks?\n2. Is there a repeatable and scalable sales roadmap? Does the company\nknow the right prospects to call on or acquire, and what to say to them to\nconsistently deliver sales?\n3. Is the sales funnel predictable? Do the same sales programs and tactics\nconsistently deliver an adequate, profitable flow of customers through\nthe funnel?\nNow let’s get started.\nOverview of the Customer Validation Process\nCustomer Validation: Overview of the Process (Figure 7.1)\nCustomer Validation has Four Phases\nPhase 1 consists of six “get ready to sell” activities; product positioning,\nsales/ marketing materials for “test selling” efforts, the hiring of a sales\ncloser, the creation of a distribution channel plan, refining a sales roadmap,\nand creating an advisory board. These activities make your team the best\nprepared early stage venture ever to hit the streets.\nPhase 2 gets founders out of the building to put the product to the ultimate\ntest: will customers validate your business model by buying your product?\nYou’ll attempt to actually sell customers an unfinished and unproven product\nwithout a professional sales organization. Getting feedback is as important as\ngetting orders. Startups in the physical channel do this with brochures,\nPowerPoints, sales materials and, where possible, product demos or mockups.\nDozens if not hundreds of meetings help refine the product presentation and\nchannel plans, validate the sales roadmap, prove the predictability of the sales\nfunnel, and validate that the business model is repeatable, scalable and\nprofitable in a real-world test.\nStartups in multi-sided markets (physical or web/mobile) need to get out\nof the building to test each side of the market. Web/Mobile marketers first\ntest users and then validate a different set of hypotheses (value proposition,\nsegment, revenue model, etc.) with the “payers,” who are marketers or\nadvertisers willing to pay to reach people using the site for free.\nPhase 3 happens once you have a couple of orders under your belt and\nenough customer information to develop and refine your product and\ncompany positioning. The positioning is tested in meetings with industry\npundits and analysts and face-to-face with the expanded customer audience.\nPhase 4 stops all activity for long enough to conduct a detailed pivot-orproceed analysis and verify that, regardless of channel, customer validation is\ncomplete and the company knows how to scale. If so, it’s ready to reap the\nrewards for founders and investors alike. But first there are lots of tough\nquestions and hard work to verify.\nIn sum, the question is simple: “is this a business worth doing,” and\ndevoting several years of backbreaking work? Will it generate enough\nrevenue, growth and profits to achieve the founders’ and investors’ goals?\nAnd has the team learned enough to make it happen?\nOdds are overwhelming that the optimum business model won’t be\nfound on the first or second try in validation.\nThe moment customer validation is over is when it’s clear that there are\nreal orders, users, or clicks—not surveys or chats. Customer validation\nconfirms that customers will accept the minimum viable product, proves that\nthe customers exist, figures out how to reach them predictably, and crafts a\nscalable plan to engage and sell many more. It’s often called the “epiphany\nmoment.”\n\nCHAPTER 8\nCustomer Validation, Phase One: “Get\nReady to Sell”\nPHASE 1 OF CUSTOMER VALIDATION PREPARES the tools to test the company’s\nability to acquire customers. In this phase, you’ll craft your product\npositioning, which guides how you write the marketing, and online materials\nneeded for the sales effort. For companies in the physical channel, other steps\nin this phase include development of collateral materials, channel sales plans,\nand a sales roadmap. Sometimes, a “sales closer” is also hired at this point.\nAnd you’ll finalize your advisory board.\nSteps in this first phase are markedly different for each channel, so\nphysical and web/mobile channels are addressed separately, as outlined in\nFigure 8.1.\nWhen all these steps are in place, it’s time to get out of the building and\nstart selling, in Phase 2. Here are the steps each channel requires before you\nare ready to sell.\nPhase 1 – Get Ready to Sell (Figure 8.1)\nGet Ready to Sell: Craft Positioning Statement\nFrom your customer’s perspective, what does your company stand for, what\ndoes your product do, and why should they care? You probably had an idea\nwhen you started the company, but now you have some real experience in\ninteracting with customers. It’s time to revisit the product vision, features and\ncompetitive information in light of what you’ve learned in customer\ndiscovery.\nCan you reduce all that you’ve learned into a single clear, compelling\nmessage explaining why your company is different and the product is worth\nbuying (or spending time with). That’s the goal of a unique selling\nproposition. A unique selling proposition builds the bond between you and\nyour customer, focuses marketing programs, and becomes the focal point for\nbuilding the company. More relevant for this step, it gets the company’s story\ndown to a short “elevator pitch” powerful enough to raise a customer’s heart\nrate. It’ll appear in lots of different places from billboards to banners and\nbusiness cards from here on out and helps focus sales and marketing efforts.\nDon’t worry about getting it perfect, because it will change with feedback\nfrom customers, analysts, and investors. For now, take a first best shot.\nWhile positioning messaging seems straightforward, it can be a\nchallenge to execute. It takes serious work to get to a pithy statement that’s\nboth understandable and compelling. It’s much easier to write (or think) long\nthan to write (or think) short. Start by revisiting what customers said they\nvalued during customer discovery. What were the top problems? Did a phrase\nkeep coming up to describe the problem or solution? Where does the product\naffect customers most? How significant is the product’s impact? What does\nthe new offering provide that competitors can’t or won’t? What does it do\nbetter? Think simple and short at all times. This may be a place where outside\ncreative resources are worth the investment.\nIn technology startups, one of the biggest challenges for engineers is to\nrealize the need for a simple message that grabs customers’ hearts and\nwallets, not their heads and calculators. It’s not about the product features.\nSeek a simple sentence that condenses the entire value proposition into a few\npithy, catchy words that say it all: “Think Different,” from Apple; “Don’t\nLeave Home Without It,” American Express; “Just Do It,” Nike; “We Try\nHarder,” Avis; “Earth’s First Soft Drink,” Perrier; “The Ultimate Driving\nMachine,” BMW.\nThe exercises, in Figures 8.2 and 8.3, developed by Geoffrey Moore (of\nCrossing the Chasm fame) early in his career as a marketing consultant, can\nhelp evoke the necessary elements:\nProduct Positioning Statement (Figure 8.2)\nHere’s how a mobile expense-reporting application, Mobiledough, might\nhave used the product position statement:\nProduct Positioning Statement Example (Figure 8.3)\nWhat might Mobiledough’s tag line be? A few candidates:\n“Your dough, on the go. Fast, accurate, online”\n“Track your expenses while you’re makin’ tracks”\n“Mobiledough. It just adds up, instantly, online”\nUse the Geoff Moore outline or one like it to brainstorm positioning\nstatements with the Customer Development team. Consider a companywide\ncontest or creative session. To see if the positioning is emotionally\ncompelling, think about the following:\nDo customers’ heart rates go up after they hear it?\nDo they lean forward to hear more? Or do you get a blank stare?\nIs it understandable in the users’ language or unique in their minds?\nFor B-to-B products, does the positioning imply a cost or competitive\nadvantage for the product?\nFor consumer products, does it save time or money or provide fun or\nlove, glamour or status?\nFinally, does the positioning pass the reality test? Claims like “lose 30\npounds in a week” or “increase sales 200 percent” or “fall in love tonight”\nstrain credibility and probably legality as well. Moreover, it’s not only the\nclaim that needs to pass this test. Is your company a credible supplier for the\nproduct you’re describing? When selling to corporate customers, there are\nadditional hurdles to think about. Are your capabilities congruent with your\nclaims?\nOne last thing to keep in mind is our continual question about what\nmarket type you’re in. If you’re offering a product in an existing market, your\nunique selling proposition is about better, faster, or higher performance. It’s\nframed by what you’ve learned from countless customer interviews about the\nbasis of competition..\nIf you’re creating a new market or trying to reframe an existing one,\nyou’ll probably come up with a transformational unique selling proposition.\nTransformational unique selling propositions deal with how the solution will\ncreate a new level or class of activity—i.e., something people could never do\nbefore.\nChecklist 27: Craft Company Positioning\nGoal: Create a clear, compelling message explaining why your company is\ndifferent and the product is worth buying\nReference: Chapter 8, Customer Validation Phase 1: “Get Ready to Sell”\nMessage statement\nCondenses Value Proposition into single phrase or sentence\nEmotionally compelling\nCredible\nTakes Market Type into account\nExit criteria:\nA short, pithy message that explains what the company stands for, what\nthe product does and why customers should buy from it, trust it, and\ncare\nGet Ready to Sell: Sales and Marketing Materials\nAcquiring customers in the physical channel evolves in a four-stage process:\nawareness, consideration, interest, and purchase. To facilitate this sales\nprocess, you’ll use the unique selling proposition you created in the last step\nto produce sales and marketing materials—product data sheets, presentations,\na website, etc.—called “marketing collateral.” Your sales team will hand or\npresent this collateral to potential customers and/or on your website to\ncommunicate the reasons customers should buy.\nThe “Get Customers” Funnel in Physical Channels (Figure 8.4)\nIn the physical channel, the job of marketing materials is not to close the\nsale but to drive prospective customers into the sales funnel, where physical\nlocations, live salespeople, and supporting selling materials take over and\neffect a transaction. The material should give people enough information to\nraise their curiosity and spark an interaction with sales—but not so much\ninformation that they can decide not to buy without first interacting with the\nchannel! Human helpers need a variety of tools to close the deal, and this step\nplans and creates a first version of the tool set that helps close the deal.\nThis section describes online tools, physical sales tools and how to tune\nboth for your audience.\nMuch of the information for the materials (product features, benefits,\nspecs) is found in the hypotheses developed and refined during customer\ndiscovery. Don’t spend money on flashy design or large print runs, but keep\nthe materials crisp and professional, knowing they’ll change based on\ncustomer feedback.\n“Get Customers” Tools for Physical Channels (Table 8.1)\nPhysical Sales Collateral and Materials\nOnce they arrive in the physical channel, whether they’re driven by the web,\nTwitter, or an old-fashioned newspaper ad, the customer eventually gets faceto-face with a salesperson. When he does, sales materials and tools are often\nrequired. Instead of randomly writing product specs and presentations,\ndevelop a “collateral plan” listing all the items needed at each sales-process\nstage (see Table 8.2 for an example). A basic minimum collateral checklist\nfor almost any company should include the following items:\nwebsite\nPowerPoint sales presentation\nDemos, prototypes and videos\nData sheets\nPrice lists, contracts and billing systems\nDon’t forget the more obvious items: white papers, company press\nclippings, customer testimonials, letterhead, presentation folders and business\ncards!\nSales Presentations\nSales presentations should deliver an updated, integrated version of the\nproblem, solution and product presentations developed during customer\ndiscovery, guided by the new positioning. The core audience during customer\nvalidation is earlyvangelists, not mainstream customers. Cover a brief outline\nof the problem, possible existing solutions, and your proposed new solution,\nand then product details. The presentation should run no more than 30\nminutes. In customer discovery, you may have found that different\npresentations were required, depending on the type of people who played a\nrole in purchase decisions inside a company or with different types of\nconsumer audiences. Were separate presentations required for senior\nmanagement and lower-level employees? How about for a technical\naudience? How about for different companies in different industries? For\nconsumer products, was there a different presentation based on\ndemographics? Income? Geography?\nA worthwhile investment at this stage of Customer Development is\nprofessional help in developing a PowerPoint template. It gives the company\na professional, established appearance even if the office remains a garage or a\nbasement.\nDemos/Prototypes/Video\nMost people you’re trying to sell to don’t have your skill in visualizing\nproducts that don’t exist. It’s why you’re the founder and they’re not. For\nmany people, most product concepts are too hard to understand without some\nkind of demo or prototype. Wherever possible, prepare some kind of\nprototype, working or not, that illustrates how the product operates and its\nkey selling points. At a minimum, provide a slide-based, nonworking\nillustration or a short video. Ideally, the presentation illustrates the old way\nand the new way of solving the problem. It can be made of cardboard or\nStyrofoam, or it can be a series of simple sketches, but it should “bring the\nproduct to life” wherever possible. Product development teams in physicalproduct startups sometimes confuse demos with working products. They’re\nnot.\nIt’s these demos that “turn on the lightbulb” over the heads of many\nearlyvangelists and get their passionate about the product.\nData Sheets\nIt’s easy to confuse product data sheets, which detail product features and\nbenefits, with solution data sheets, which address customer problems and bigpicture solutions. Which ones you need depend on market type. When\nentering an existing market, your focus is on the product and why yours is\nbetter. Here, product data sheets are the best way to illustrate that. However,\nif you’re creating a new market or cloning a market, the solution data sheets\nare more appropriate. If you’re re-segmenting a market, both types of data\nsheets are essential.\nPrice Lists, Contracts and Billing System\nHopefully by now, someone has asked, “How much does it cost?” Prepare\nprice lists, quote forms, and contracts. These documents makes a small\nstartup look like a real company. They also force codification of assumptions\nabout product pricing, configurations, delivery, discounts, and terms.\nConsumer products require a way to take early orders, usually involving\ncredit card processing, e-commerce tools, and more.\nCollateral Needs to Be Tuned to the Audience\nIn validation, startups selling in business-to-business markets have two\ndifferent audiences for collateral materials: the earlyvangelist, the technology\ngatekeepers and each require different messages and materials (see Table\n8.2). Earlyvangelists buy the vision first and then buy the product. Therefore,\nmake sure materials are clear and detailed enough about vision and benefits\nto help earlyvangelists sell the idea by themselves, after the presentation\nends, inside their companies or to friends or family.\nMost business-to-business selling situations require a technical overview\nwith a distinctly deeper level of information for other players in the sales\ncycle. Issue-specific white papers can address particular areas of interest or\nconcern. Develop these as they become necessary but not before. Customers\nwill tell you what they need. Especially in tight economic climates, business\ncustomers might require a return-on-investment (ROI) white paper. It’s a\ncustomer’s fancy way of saying, “Show me how I financially justify this\npurchase. Will it save me money in the long run?” Much of the development\nwork for this was done as part of the customer discovery process.\nEarlyvangelist champions will usually have to pitch the product to others in\ntheir company—often without startup spokespeople present—before\nsomeone agrees to sign the check. For consumers the issue is the same; just\nimagine kids trying to make the ROI issue for an iPad. “I won’t have to carry\nDVD’s in the car, and promise to read more books if you buy them for me.”\nOn the other hand, startups selling in business-to-consumer marketers\nfocus the collateral on materials for the sales channel: shelf-talkers, retail\npackaging, coupons, and ad slicks. The collateral plan distinguishes\nobjectives, targets for, and timing of each piece.\nTest-drive all the collateral, because what’s written in the confines of an\noffice often has little relevance in the field. A/B-test online “collateral” such\nas landing pages, checkout pages, and product feature/benefit statements as\nambitiously as possible (more on this in the next section). Consumers and\nbusiness buyers have no obligation to memorize the company’s jargon or\nunderstand “inside jokes.” Keep the collateral plan handy. Update and add to\nit along the way.\nExample of a Business-to-Business, Direct-Sales Collateral Plan\n(Table 8.2)\nOnline Tools for Physical Channel Marketers\nEven if the company’s principal channel strategy involves physical\ndistribution customers still search for products online, you’ll need an array of\nbasic online tools to generate awareness and trials and to provide product\ninformation on the web. These tools almost always include a website, some\nkind of viral marketing program to find customers, and digital forms of\nbrochures or other selling materials. In addition, social networks have\nbecome huge sources of customers, even for the most mundane physical\ngoods, and lots of new product ideas surface every day in Twitter streams.\nEven the most complicated “old world” products\nare promoted through websites and online\nmarketing.\nEven the most complicated “old world” products like construction\nequipment and materials are promoted through expansive websites and\nmassive online marketing programs. As a result, marketers in the physical\nchannel must explore and develop online customer-acquisition and marketing\nplans even if their pumps, bushings and gravel are sold only over the counter\nin a dingy warehouse. Warehouse or not, today’s buyer will often search for\nthose products online.\nModern marketing is as much about “pulling” customers to a product as\nit is about “pushing” that service at them. For example, an e-mail in your\ninbox or a sales rep at your desk is there to push a product at you. Samples at\na Costco display or search engines invite, or pull, you toward the product,\nencouraging you to explore it voluntarily because it’s aroused your interest.\nStrong marketing campaigns and tools should be blended to do a good job of\nboth push and pull marketing.\nHere are some guidelines to consider in preparing those materials.\nWebsites\nAt this stage, websites for companies using the physical channel should\nprovide clear information on the company’s vision and the problem it was\nfounded to solve. Your job in this step is to learn how much detailed product\ninformation can pull the customer in to facilitate a sale. At a minimum, the\nwebsite’s job is to arouse interest in and spark consideration of the product or\ncompany and to drive interested prospects into the physical sales channel.\n(For low-dollar-item products, you can even have the website close the sale.)\nHowever, the website shouldn’t provide customers with reasons not to buy (it\nshouldn’t display details about price, installation requirements, etc). It should\ninstead encourage interested prospects to interact with the company. Use the\nsite to collect as much information as the prospect will provide. (Remember,\nresponse rates drop in direct proportion to the number of “required fields” in\na sign-up form.)\nSocial Marketing Tools\nMany companies that sell physical products exclusively in a physical channel\nuse Facebook pages, Twitter streams, and other social marketing tools to\nspread the word and attract customers. They also use these online tools to\ninvite customers and prospects to introduce products to their colleagues and\nfriends. Making all this readily available and promoting it ambitiously is a\nrelatively inexpensive way to accelerate the Get process. (Details about these\ntools are found in Chapter 3, and later in this chapter.)\nE-mail and e-mailable Marketing Tools\nE-mail messages are an important tool for communicating with prospects and\ncustomers online, since they can be targeted and often individualized based\non what you know about them. When crafted carefully to provide useful\ninformation beyond a flat-out sales pitch, they can break through the cluttered\ninboxes of even the most cynical prospects. Create e-mail messages and\ncampaigns that reflect what you know about the individual and design multie-mail campaigns for optimum impact. Create digital versions of brochures,\nwhite papers, and other sales materials to accompany the e-mails themselves.\n(Learn more about e-mail campaigns in the customer-relationships section of\nChapter 3.)\nNote to reader: Although tailored to web/mobile startups, the following pages\ninclude tips and guidelines that physical startups will find useful.\nGet Ready to Sell: Acquire/Activate Customers\nPlan (Web/Mobile)\nRemember that “Get” activity is very different in web/mobile: you must\nattract customers to your site, app, or product or they won’t even know you\nexist! Review this section, which, in brief, says: figure out where your\ncustomers go when they’re searching for a solution; be visible and inviting in\nas many of those places as possible; and “earn” their visit to your product\nwith helpful, friendly information, not hard-boiled sales pitches.\n“Get Customers” Tools for Web/Mobile Channels (Table 8.3)\nThe “Acquire” Plan and Tools\nThe Acquire plan is short, to-the-point, and tactical in nature. The plan helps\nyou find tools that predictably deliver large numbers of “good” customers\n(who engage with or spend heavily on the site or app) into the widest point of\nthe funnel (at the left) at the lowest cost per customer.\nThe “Get Customers” Funnel in Web/Mobile Channels (Figure 8.5)\nWARNING: There is no possible way you can read, process and act on\nthis section in one read. There’s a lot here. Skim it first, then go back\nand read each section. Then think about what action you need to take for\nyour startup.\nThe Acquire plan (see sample plan) should fit on a single page. It details\nthe first set of Acquire activities to test and includes:\nWho: Who’s responsible for driving the program; who will add support\nor expertise\nWhat: Describe the tactic and its parts (see below for a list of tools)\nBudget: Estimate of spending for the first round of testing\nTiming: Outline the steps needed to launch (our example in Figure 8.6\nuses a four-week cycle)\nWhy: Specific, measurable acquisition goals of each plan element\nThe acquire plan and tactics will change repeatedly, since in customer\nvalidation they’re basically a series of experiments.\nThe acquire plan and tactics will change\nrepeatedly... they’re basically a series of\nexperiments.\nIn a physical consumer channel like Walmart, marketers seldom know\nwhich consumers see, touch, or buy any particular product. But in the\nweb/mobile channels, every aspect of consumer behavior can be\ninstrumented, analyzed and, often as not, optimized to improve business\nperformance. Be sure your product is instrumented to track every consumer\naction or inaction. Without building the instrumentation upfront, optimizing\nyour acquisition activities is more challenging, if not downright impossible.\nA Sample Acquire Spreadsheet\nShown in Figure 8.6 is a sample of part of an Acquire plan for a web startup\nwith a small budget. The plan is built around a few key assumptions:\nWho: Two staffers are needed, one full-time and one half-time\nWhat: The tactics, chosen by the team, seem best-suited to maximizing\nleads and sales (see next section for a list of tools)\nBudget: The startup has about $25,000 to spend for this\nA Sample Acquire Plan and Timetable (Figure 8.6)\nTiming: The team is allowing itself four weeks to prepare all elements for\nthe launch of validation\nWhy: The goal is to get 30,000 to 35,000 customers to download a free\ntrial and to get 15 percent of them to convert to paying customers. This\nwould achieve a customer acquisition cost of about $5, as suggested in\nthis plan’s revenue model hypothesis\nMulti-sided or not?: Does your product have both users and payers? If so,\na multi-sided market requires a separate plan for each “side” of its\nmarket. Users will be acquired one way, while reaching and selling\nadvertisers will demand a totally different approach. (Our sample is a\nsingle-sided market)\nGuidelines for Developing the Acquire Plan\nDetermining whom to acquire (i.e., which customers,) what promotional\ntactics to use, and what to say and how to say it (the content and messaging)\nis made easy because you did most of the research and planning in customer\ndiscovery. Start this plan by referring back to three hypothesis documents\nyou devised when you created and tested your original business model canvas\nhypotheses:\nCustomer segments: customers to be reached (which guides e-mail,\ntargeting of marketing activities, ads, and PR)\nCustomer relationships: how customers will be reached (SEO, PPC, email, PR, etc.)\nValue proposition: what will excite customers and persuade them to\nengage, visit or buy\nDon’t be afraid to update or change the hypotheses based on the latest\nfeedback or even instinct at this point, since they’re still just “best guesses”\nconfirmed by only a few customers. Other guidelines to keep in mind:\nRemember that this is a test to figure out which tools work and costeffectively when they’re launched during customer creation, the next\nstep. This is not a company or product launch. Your goal is learning, not\nrevenue, so don’t be afraid to test lots of alternatives\nDefine success upfront for each test, using a pass/fail metric (such as\n“one in five people will click”), and monitor results\nBe the greatest, friendliest, coolest thing going. Your job is to attract or\ninvite customers to your product, site, or app, so be interesting and\nwelcoming (and, if appropriate, even fun or funny) rather than not just\noffering a hard, cold sale. Think like your customers, and be prominent\nand visible where you think they’ll be searching for a solution like\nyours. (Think about forums and online communities)\nRunning tests without collecting data is a cardinal\nsin.\nInstrument everything. Running tests without collecting data is a\ncardinal sin. Engineering needs to spend the extra effort to collect all\ncustomer behavior data so it can be measured and optimized\ncontinuously. Confront this upfront, as it’s hard to “bolt on” later\nDon’t start everything at once, since that will create chaos both in the\nmarket and in the company. For example, start search engine\noptimization and pay-per-click tests on Day Five, and add e-mail and\naffiliate marketing programs two or three weeks later. The individual,\nprogram-by-program results will be easier to identify and measure\nDon’t spend more than $2,000 or, if well-funded, $10,000 to test any\none thing. The startup usually can’t afford it at this stage, and the risks\nof guessing wrong are too great\nWhen a test seems to be working, ramp it up to be sure it withstands the\ntest of scale. If a $2,000 e-mail marketing campaign is performing,\ndouble it, refine it and do it again\nChoose agency partners very carefully, if at all. The costs and\nmanagement time needed to hire a pr, ad, or web agency this early in\nyour startup make it a very risky proposition. Most often, agencies are\ngreat at execution of programs but not at developing and testing\nstrategies. Rely on founders and staff where possible, as they know the\nproduct and the business model best. Consider freelance talent\nspecialized in developing tests and strategies or those who specialize in\nspecific tasks (e.g., pay-per-click, demos and other specialized skills) if\nthey don’t exist within the company\nDon’t launch the Acquire effort by itself. Activation programs must be\nready to “catch” the customers you’ve acquired, so if there’s copy\nsaying, “Sign up today and get a free box of chocolates,” for example,\nthe site’s back-end system has to be operating, the chocolates have to be\nready to ship, and copy for the thank-you e-mail must be ready to go. If\nyou’re taking customers’ money, all back-end systems need to be\nworking, including such elements as receipts, credit-card processing,\nand customer service. Similarly, site and app instrumentation must be up\nand running, tested and feeding the management dashboard so it can\nmeasure the behavior of every customer who passes through the funnel.\nRemember that acquisition by itself is one of several integrated pieces of\nthe “Get” strategy (there’s also activation, retention, and “grow\ncustomers,” to name a few).\nThe acquisition plan is managed through close monitoring of every step\ncustomers take as they move through the sales or “get customers” funnel.\nThat monitoring, generally in a dashboard, enables constant effort to improve\nperformance or “throughput”—customers movement from one step to the\nnext—at every step of the funnel, using tools detailed in the next section,\n“optimizing the acquire plan.”\nAcquire Plan Tools\nAcquisition tools you can buy\nThe list of customer acquisition tools you can buy and use is virtually\nendless, but their customer impact and effectiveness vary over time.\nAcquisition is a numbers game based on your ability to cost-effectively\ndeliver large volumes of customers to your site or app. Basic tools include:\nsearch-engine marketing\ne-mail marketing\noutreach to bloggers\naffiliate marketing\nonline lead generation\ncustomer incentives\nUse the web (and www.steveblank.com) to identify the latest\ninnovations and to select vendors. Most tools are discussed in detail in\nCustomer Relationships.\nWARNING: There is no possible way you can read, process and act on\nthis section in one read. There’s a lot here. Skim it first, then go back\nand read each section. Then think about what action you need to take for\nyour startup.\nIn the activation step, users decide—all by themselves—whether to\nengage with or buy your product, and the decision is often made in a matter\nof seconds. So the home or landing page must work hard and fast to activate\nnewly acquired “lookers,” converting them into buyers, users, or tryers.\n(Activation sometimes happens in an app store, via e-mail, through the\nchannel, or by telephone.) If you can’t get people to activate at once, ideally\nyou can get them to at least sign up so they can perhaps be persuaded to try,\nengage, or buy later.\n\nThe landing page is where activation most often begins. (Figure 8.7)\nWherever the customer arrives, he or she typically knows little if\nanything about where he or she has just landed. Here’s what you need to\naddress to activate a customer, using an oversimplified example of what goes\nthrough the visitor’s mind on arrival:\nWhy am I here? They want me to buy this new online multiplayer game\nWhat makes it special? Oh, here’s a feature list and reasons to buy\nHow do I know it’s any good? Here’s a demo, list of endorsements, user\nquotes, etc.\nWhere do I get more information? I see buttons pointing to free trials,\nmore info, etc.\nNext? What does the company want me to do? Oh, click here to try/\nbuy/sign up\nGuidelines for Developing the “Activate” Plan\nIn the customer validation phase, the activation plan is really a test plan, A/Btesting every key aspect of the home/landing page, from color and copy to\noffers and navigation. It’s OK to start with approximations or guesses, but\nthey should iterate rapidly based on measured customer responses.\nShould a landing-page offer scream “free” or subtly ask for a credit\ncard? Should the “buy now” button be elegant and on top or bright orange\nand huge in the lower right-hand corner? Does an animated product demo\nactivate more users than a simple graphic? There are scores if not hundreds of\nvariables on almost any home page, and many tests must be repeated more\nthan once to confirm results. Outside information architects and design\nprofessionals can help. They understand the range of tools available as well\nas the latest tricks of the trade in this highly creative process.\nThe list of tools, tricks, and variables to try is nearly endless, and it’s\nhard to predict which ones will win. That’s why repeated testing and\nmeasurement are so important, following the “test, measure, tweak” approach\ndiscussed earlier.\nHere’s what an activation plan should include:\nTwo types of action steps: Activation happens both on and off the home\npage, so create two separate lists of the “Get” customers activities you\nplan to test (like offering a premium with every signup)\nFirst/second test: This is customer discovery, where you’re running\nsmall-scale tests of your activation programs. Each of those programs\nneeds to be tested at least twice, if not far more frequently, as you try to\nfind the program that’ll generate the most users or customers. Identify at\nleast the first two tests\nPass/fail test: Every test should have a “pass/fail,” or an expectation that\ndefines what “success” will look like if you have it. Based on\nexperience, trials, or research, identify the metric that’ll determine if the\nexperiment was a success\nAn “Activate” Plan Example\nMost activation happens on the home or landing page, where you’re doing\nanything you can to get a user or customer you’ve acquired (he or she came\nto your page) and trying to engage them—get them to click, sign up, post a\ncomment, play, or buy.\nThe home page is “where the action is” for\nactivation.\nAnd while the home page is “where the action is” for activation, there\nare other things you can also do—like send follow-up e-mails, for example—\nto further engage someone who’s expressed more than a passing interest.\nTable 8.4 is a simplified example of what an activation plan might look\nlike for a social network where new golfers can offer and solicit improvement\ntips. In this example, since the business is in a multi-sided market, activation\ngoals include such non-monetary actions as registration, inviting friends,\nasking a question or answering one.\nSample Activation Plan for a Golfers’ Social Network (Table 8.4)\nTools for the Activate plan\nActivation happens both on and off the home page. Key tools to consider for\neach are in the bullet points that follow.\nOn the home or landing page\nThe landing page itself offers lots of ways to drive activations, including\ncontent, look and feel, and navigation. It can also showcase these activation\ntools:\nproduct demos\nfree trials\ncustomer contact tools\nanimation\nNon-home page acquisition tools\nWhile the home page is the primary activation tool, consider these others too:\ne-mail cascades\nprice/incentives\ntraditional tools\nOn the home or landing page itself:\nStart with Content, Look and Feel, Functionality\nand Navigation\nGood landing pages bear little resemblance to online brochures. They’re\ninvitations to “activate now,” working hard to invite customers to engage or\ninteract with—or buy—the product. This must happen literally at once, often\nin seconds. Otherwise the customer (and the money spent to acquire him or\nher in the previous step) vanishes with the click of a mouse. Develop the\nhome/landing page along four axes:\n1. Content: Does the site present everything for a customer needs to make\nthe “activation” decision simply, in multiple places (for example, does\nevery page say “join now”)? Is it friendly, informative, and inviting?\n2. Look and feel: Does the appearance relate to the audience (“corporate”\nfor business apps, “serious” for financial sites, “edgy” for teen or\nskateboarding products)? Does it match the typical style of the\ndemographic or their country?\n3. Functionality: What tools, widgets, configurators, demos or other\ndevices can quickly engage customers, get them experimenting with and\nexperiencing the product itself, and figuring out what it costs, how much\ntime it would save, or how the game plays?\n4. Navigation/structure: How is information organized? How accessible is\nit? How easy is it for users to complete high-value tasks (ordering,\nsearching, etc.)?\nHere’s how to approach each area.\nHome/Landing Page Content:\n• Tell me how I got here! Users arrive at the home/landing page in a\nvariety of ways (clicks, e-mails, referrals), but don’t assume they\nknow where they’ve landed. Welcome them; explain the site\n(“Welcome to the No. 1 online gaming portal.”) to avoid fast\nabandonment\n• Reinforce the “scent” of the e-mail, ad, or tool that drove the customer\nto the page. Use similar verbiage (and look and feel) to increase\nconfidence that the viewer has come to the right place\n• Issue a clear call to action. The “pitch,” or call to action, tells the\ncustomer what you want him or her to do. It should reflect positioning\ndeveloped in Stage 1 of validation, whether it’s “buy now,” “sign up,”\nor “attend a seminar.” Use redundant calls to action wherever you\ncan, but be sure they’re not confusing. Clearly tell visitors what to do\nand why doing so delivers value to them. The landing page should\nalways accomplish the following:\nExplain what problem the product solves and why it’s important to\nusers and worthy of their attention\nCommunicate ease of use and installation for the product\nClearly explain how the product works\nProvide fast proof that it works (user quotes, competitive analysis,\ndemos, etc.)\nCalls to action appear three ways on a home/landing page: hyperlinks,\nbuttons, and forms. They should stand out and be obvious to every visitor.\nHighlight product features that make the most powerful pitch for activation or\npurchase, and always provide easy access to more information about all the\nabove.\nSome guidelines for home or landing page content development:\nEncourage me to “experience the offer:” Never think of the landing\npage as a brochure. It’s effective only if it encourages customer\nengagement, trial, or purchase. All content should invite involvement,\nand offers should be judiciously sprinkled throughout headlines,\ngraphics and text, including “try now” textlinks embedded at least\noccasionally in body copy\nOffer multiple calls to action ranging from “buy now” and “learn more”\nto “download our white paper” and “talk to someone.” Remember to\nmake one of these far more prominent than all the others—the action\nmost desired by the company\nWrite short! Web visitors are very fragile, temporary guests. Respect\ntheir short attention spans and get to the point before they depart. The\nbest calls to action are generally written in 10 or fewer words and\ndisplayed in an easily readable font\nBe specific. One of the most powerful page elements should be the core\nproduct-positioning statement developed in Step 1 of customer\nvalidation. Succinctly tell users why they should buy or use what the\ncompany’s selling\nUse bold graphics such as snipes or bursts on the landing page to\npromote a mobile site.\nDeploy contests, promos and sweepstakes to encourage mobile\ndownloads. These are highly valuable in the online space—both for\nusers, who can redeem such offers immediately, and for startups, which\ncan test and adjust offers on the fly\nManage your content inventory. Content should build credibility for the\ncompany, presenting it as solid, established, and ready to do business.\nInformation on most of the following should be accessible from the landing\npage:\nproduct detail and information about the solution\ncustomer lists and success stories\ncustomer resources and support\nvendor partners\ncompany background\ncurrent news and events\ncompany contact information (postal, phone, and e-mail)\nthe company’s privacy policy\nLook and Feel\nDesign the home or landing page for maximum impact and minimal\nconfusion. Always provide the user with multiple pathways to the desired\n“activation” action, whether it’s subscribing, posting, playing or buying.\nStrive for fewer, crisper design elements, not more, keeping national cultural\ndifferences in mind when designing. (The advice below is for the U.S., where\nusers expect websites to look clean and simple.) In some other countries,\nincluding China, users expect more design elements, which may look\ncluttered to a Western eye.\nKeep it clean and simple, without too many distractions from the call to\naction\nPick one promotional message and drive it the hardest at the expense of\nothers. Make it more prominent, supported by other things on the page,\nand compelling, along the lines of “free trial download” or “special\nintroductory pricing this month”\nLeave plenty of white space. Crowded pages are clearly a turnoff. An\noverbearing number of graphic elements (art, type, buttons, etc.) will\nfrustrate and distract users\nUse visuals. Whether using graphics, videos, demos, or diagrams, don’t\nrely on copy itself to maintain user interest. Web visitors have extremely\nshort attention spans. Keep the diagrams, charts and graphics simple.\nUse animation carefully to add interest\nUse interactivity. The web allows customer interaction with the brand,\nsomething no other medium allows. (If these kinds of tools aren’t on the\nsite, you’re not using the web to its fullest potential)\nUse big buttons. “Download” or “buy now” or “sign up” should be\ngraphically interesting, sizable and easy to spot\nNavigation and Functionality\nNavigation is really about two things: the logical organization of information\nand the shortest routes to task completion.\n“Friendly” navigation provides users several “routes” to the call to\naction. Routes might take a user to a demo, to customer testimonials, to a\nwhite paper, or to a list of product features. Since nobody can predict what a\ncustomer wants to do next, each pathway should easily lead to “buy now” or\nanother call to action.\nConfusing navigation is the “foe,” offering too many choices, confusing\nbuttons, textlinks and a hodgepodge of options a user might choose. This\noften leads to higher abandon rates.\nOverall Website Functionality:\n• Use tools to invite customer engagement. Video, animation, demos,\nconfigurators and other devices should provide customers multiple\nways to engage with the product itself, any way they’d like. “Take a\ntour (of our product)” and “play now” and “forecast your retirement\nneeds” are typical engagement invitations, and each is far more\npowerful than offers like “read more” or “learn about...” Some\nexamples:\n1. “Enter your age/answer three questions to learn how little this\ninsurance costs”\n2. “Click here to see Facebook friends’ photos on our site”\n3. “Pick your character and start talking to him now”\n4. “Find young single women in your neighborhood right now”\n5. “What’s your favorite golf ball? Click here for deep discounts. Free\nshipping!”\n• Use a demo to engage users with the product and show off its features\nand ease of use. Make the demo more compelling (and under a minute\nlong) than a PowerPoint. When possible, draw users into an actual,\nfunctioning component of the product (“put your data here” or “play\nthis brief version.”). The demo should end at the call to action\nEngage users with the product and show off its\nfeatures.\n• Offer free trials. Not to be confused with a freemium pricing strategy, a\nfree trial offer can be restricted by limiting the free version’s\nfunctionality or duration (as in “try it free for two weeks”). Follow up\nwith a series of e-mails that introduce features, offer tips, and provide\nreasons to buy. Where it makes sense financially, follow up with\ntelesales\n• Click to contact. Particularly for commerce and paid subscription sites\n(and probably too costly for freemium or multi-sided startups), offer\nseveral ways for prospects to contact the company. This can be as\nsimple as a clickable link that spawns an e-mail to the sales\ndepartment or a form for requesting more information or a call from\nSales. Many commerce sites use real-time live voice and chat\ntechnology to engage quickly with prospects and enhance the chances\nof activation\n• Use animation. Interactive configurators, calculators, animated demos,\nmicrosites, and many other utilities can bring the product to life and\nengage the customer. These can be developed inexpensively by\noutside sources found online. Some websites launch brief welcome\nvideos or quiet, animated demos that load automatically when a user\ngets to the site, but only play on demand (so it doesn’t annoy the\nvisitor or drive her away). Use animation sparingly, as it can be\njarring\n• Incorporate source-driven pages: Create multiple landing pages and\nmatch each one to the source of the click that brought users to the\npage. “Welcome, Yahoo friends” would almost certainly increase the\nvisitor’s comfort and click-through rate, as would a “special offer for\nYahoo e-mail customers” that, oddly enough, is the same offer\npresented to Gmail customers or on a slightly different landing page\nAn entire industry has emerged around tools to\nencourage customers to take action.\nAn entire industry has emerged around tools to encourage customers to\ntake action while at a company’s website. New home-page tools are\ndeveloped regularly, and some grow in popularity while others fade. This is\nan area where a modest amount of time spent on online research about the\nlatest tools can pay off. In addition, freelance or small-agency experts in\nactivation tests might be helpful (just remember that you don’t want to run\nmajor programs yet, just experiments). Check www.steveblank.com for the\nlatest tools.\nGet Ready to Sell: Hire a Sales Closer\nIn most startups, the founding team is typically product-oriented and rarely\nincludes a sales professional. While founders often do just fine at finding\nearlyvangelist customers by themselves, they often lack the skill or\nexperience to turn those relationships into orders. As sales efforts get under\nway, it’s time to honestly determine whether someone on the founding team\nhas the necessary experience to close deals. Does the team know how to\nnegotiate with a buyer or a purchasing manager? Negotiate deal terms with a\nCFO? Are the founders willing to bet the company on their ability to close\nthe first sales? If not, it’s time to hire a sales closer.\nA sales closer is not a sales VP who wants to rush out to build and\nmanage a large sales organization. Good sales closers are aggressive, love\nearly markets, want great compensation for success, and have no interest in\nbuilding a sales organization. Typically, closers are experienced startup\nsalespeople noted not just for their rolodexes in the target market but also for\nfabulous listening, pattern-recognition and collaboration skills. They also\nlove finding new markets and closing deals and aren’t ready to retire behind a\ndesk.\nWhile the closer will be an integral part of customer validation, the\nfounders and the CEO still need to actively lead the process. Together, the\nfounders and the sales closer are the core of the Customer Development team.\nIt’s their job to learn and discover enough information to build the sales and\nchannel roadmaps. Going once around the customer validation loop without a\nsales closer may make sense unless it holds back progress. At that point, hire\nthe closer. A closer is invaluable in setting up meetings, pushing for followup meetings, and closing the deal. Having a sales closer is in no way a\nsubstitute for getting founders personally out and in front of customers.\nChecklist 29: Get Ready To Sell: Hire A Sales\nCloser\nGoal: Identify someone with the necessary skills and experience to close\ndeals\nReference: Chapter 8, Customer Validation Phase 1: Get Ready to Sell\nExperienced startup salesperson\nGood contacts in the target market\nStellar listening, pattern recognition and collaboration skills\nUnderstand difference: closer vs. VP of sales\nDoes not replace founders getting out in front of customers personally\nExit criteria:\nExperienced sales closer is hired\nGet Ready to Sell: Sales Channel Roadmap\nThis sales channel roadmap section assumes that, in Customer Discovery,\nyour team evaluated the distribution channel alternatives and is focused on\none specific sales channel. Get one channel right first, then expand later.\nRather than spreading yourself thin, focus on one\nchannel first.\nWhat if you’re not sure this is the right channel? It’s OK, this is just a\ntest. Rather than spreading yourself thin, testing multiple distribution\nchannels at once, focus on one channel first, whether it’s direct sales, chain\nstores, or mail order. Based on test results, other channels are easily added\nlater. The one exception to this rule: companies using their own website to\nsell directly to end-users should also test that in parallel.\nElements of a sales channel roadmap are:\nchannel “food chain”\nchannel responsibility\nchannel discount and financials\nchannel management\nSales Channel “Food Chain”\nFor a distribution channel, the food chain is the link of organizations between\nyou and your customer (from your vp of sales to a sales rep to a distributor to\na retailer, for example). The food chain describes each of the organizations in\nthe chain, and its relationships with the company and with one another.\nHere, for example, is the food chain showing how books move from a\npublisher to a book-buying customer at an e-book publishing company. The\nfood chain diagram might look as simple as Figure 8.8 below.\nDirect ebook Publishing Food Chain (Figure 8.8)\nHowever, selling through the traditional physical distribution food chain\nfor printed books, it’s far more complex, as shown in Figure 8.10.\nBook Publishing Physical Channel Food Chain (Figure 8.9)\nTo get ready to sell, create a visual representation of your channel food\nchain. It may include these or other “links” in the chain:\nNational wholesalers: Stock, pick, pack, ship and collect, and then pay\nthe publisher for orders received. They fulfill orders but don’t create\ndemand\nDistributors: Use their own sales force to sell to bookstore chains and\nindependents. The distributor makes the sale; the bookstore actually\norders from the national wholesaler\nRetailers: This is where the customer sees and can buy books\nReview the channel hypothesis to see what needs to be included in your\ndiagram.\nChannel Responsibility\nA channel-responsibility map diagrams the relationships in a complex\ndistribution channel. A written description of these responsibilities, created in\ndescribing the “food chain,” should accompany the diagram. It helps\neveryone on the team understand why the channel was selected and what to\nexpect from it.\nOne of the mistakes startups often make is assuming their channel\npartners invest in creating customer demand. Most do not. For example, in\nFigure 8.10, don’t assume the book wholesaler does anything other than stock\nand ship books. The same is true for the distributor. It takes orders from\nbookstores and in some cases may promote book sales to bookstores, but it\ndoesn’t bring customers into the store to buy. (Unfortunately nowadays most\npublishers don’t create demand either.)\nChannel Responsibility Map (Figure 8.10)\nChannel Discounts and Financials\nEach tier in the “food chain” costs the company money, since each tier\ncharges for its services. In most channels, these fees are calculated as a\npercentage of the “list” or retail price consumers pay. To understand how the\nmoney flows from the customer to company, first calculate the discounts\neach channel tier requires. Continuing with our book-publishing example, we\ncan construct a diagram, as shown in Figure 8.11, detailing the discount each\ntier requires.\nChannel Discounts (Figure 8.11)\nAs you can see, a book retailing for $20 would net our publishing\ncompany $7 after everyone in the channel took his cut. From this $7, the\npublisher must pay the author a royalty, market the book, pay for the printing\nand binding, contribute to overhead, and realize a profit. Out of the $20 a\ncustomer pays, there’s only a dollar or two for the author! No wonder authors\nare ditching print and going directly to e-books.\nChannel discounts are only the first step in examining how money flows\nin a complex distribution channel. For example, in the book channel and\nmany others (software, media, more), sales are on a consignment basis with\n100 percent return rights. This means your product (the unsold books in the\nexample) can be returned to your company for full credit (and to add insult to\ninjury, you have to pay the return freight for returned products). Why is this a\nproblem? A mistake that startups frequently make when they use a\ndistribution channel is to record the sale to the channel (in this case the\nnational wholesaler) as revenue. The sad truth is that orders from a channel\npartner don’t mean that end customers bought the product; it only means they\nhope and believe they will.\nIn addition, some channels have a stock rotation-returns policy (outdated\nfood, old versions of software or hardware) requiring allowances for a\nproportion (or all) of your “sold” products to be returned.\nYour channel financial plan should include a description of all the\nfinancial relationships among tiers of the channel (see Figure 8.12).\nChannel Financial Relationships (Figure 8.12)\nChannel Management\nAlthough every company’s goal is a well-managed and carefully selected\nsales channel, failure to select the right channel or to control the channel\noften results in miserable sales revenue and unanticipated channel costs.\nMuch like instrumenting a website, you need to monitor your channel\ninventory levels, sell in and sell through. In a direct-sales channel, it’s\nstraightforward: no goods leave your company until there’s a customer order.\nIn an indirect channel, however, the biggest risk is knowing how much enduser demand actually exists. Why? Your company has a direct relationship\nonly with the tier of distribution closest to it. You’re dependent on channelpartner reports, which are often months out of date, to learn how much\nproduct has “sold through” the channel or how much has actually been\npurchased. Another risk is the temptation in an indirect channel to “stuff” the\nchannel. Stuffing means getting a tier of the channel to accept more product\non consignment than sales forecasts reasonably expect the channel to sell.\nThis tactic can provide a temporary but imaginary inflation of sales, followed\nby a debacle (or in the case of public companies, lawsuits) later. All these\npotential issues need to be documented and discussed in the channelmanagement plan in order to avoid surprises later.\nMulti-Sided Markets\nMulti-sided markets are more common in the web/mobile channels but exist\nin the physical channel as well. Medical devices are a good example of a\n“physical” channel with a complex multi-sided market. An artificial hip may\nbe approved by the FDA, recommend by a doctor, implanted inside a patient,\nbought by a hospital, installed by a surgeon but paid for by an insurance\ncompany. (See Figure 8.13 below.) In this case, just focusing on patients or\ndoctors or hospitals without understanding who the payers are and how they\nreimburse for hip implants would be a fatal error. Startups in multi-sided\nmarkets need to validate all sides of their channel hypothesis.\nChannel Diagram for a Complex Multi-Sided Market (Figure 8.13)\nChecklist 30: Sales Action Channel Plan\nGoal: Develop a preliminary Sales Channel Action Plan to test the channel\nhypothesis developed in Customer Discovery.\nReference: Chapter 8, Customer Validation Phase 1: Get Ready to Sell\nRefined distribution channel plan\n“Food chain” drawing\nAll organizations between company and end-user customers identified\nEach organization and its relationships with the company and with one\nanother identified\nChannel Responsibility Map\nRelationships in the Company’s distribution channel diagrammed\nWritten descriptions of all responsibilities\nFinancial relationships between channel tiers mapped out\nChannel management plan devised\nProcess identified for monitoring channel management plan\nExit criteria: Preliminary sales action plan that\nDescribes the channel “food chain” and attendant responsibilities\nFigures out the costs associated with each tier of the channel\nAddresses management of the sales channel\nPass/Fail tests identified as appropriate\nGet Ready to Sell: Develop the Sales Roadmap\nA classic startup flaw is hiring a sales force before you’ve figured out how to\nsell. At the start, a fog of uncertainty hangs over you. It’s the founders’ job to\ngather enough information to illuminate how to proceed one step at a time,\nand then assemble that information into a coherent picture of the right path to\ntake. We call this the “sales roadmap.”\nYour goal is to determine who your true customers are and how they’ll\nbuy your product. You build a sales team only when you completely\nunderstand the process that transforms a prospect into a purchaser and know\nyou can sell the product at a price that supports your business model. With\nthe sales roadmap in their hands, the members of your sales force will be able\nto focus on actual sales instead of the hit-and-miss experimentation you’ll\nundertake as you move through the customer validation process.\nWith the sales roadmap in their hands, the\nmembers of your sales force will be able to focus on\nactual sales.\nA sales roadmap details every step from the first call to a prospective\nbuyer to the contract signing. It should also show how those steps vary from\none company, buyer or job title to the next. The initial sales-road-map\nhypothesis developed in customer discovery should be updated based on\ncustomer feedback and revisited before sales calls begin. Don’t worry—it\nwill change further based on field experience with customers.\nThe roadmap’s complexity depends on the customer’s size, buying cycle\nand budget as well as the product’s price, the industry, and the distribution\nchannel selected. The roadmap for selling the CEO of a midsize company is\nclearer, say, than the route to selling a Fortune 500 VP. And roadmaps to\nSafeway, Intel or Toys “R” Us are far tougher than those leading to local\nflorists or pet stores. Good roadmaps are hard work, but they’re the\ndifference between success and failure. Refine the roadmap while the\ncompany is lean and small, before dozens of sales reps find themselves lost\non the road, selling without a map.\nThree other key sales-planning tools support the sales roadmap:\ncompany organization and influence maps, and customer access maps.\nOrganization and Influence Maps\nRemember those organization and influence map briefs you created in the\ncustomer discovery step? It’s time to pull them off the wall and study your\nfindings. By now your early hypotheses have been modified to reflect the\nreality you encountered as you spoke with potential customers. Use this\ninformation to develop a working model of the purchase process for your\ntarget customer. You’ll also want to take a closer look at the notes from your\nencounters with possible earlyvangelists. You might also want to bring in\ncustomer information from other sources such as a company’s annual report,\nHoovers, Dun & Bradstreet or press articles.\nThe E.piphany sales cycle is a good example of how the influence map\nfor a complex sale can be developed. Given the six-to seven-figure cost of\nE.piphany’s software, buyers had to feel a significant pain, recognize it as a\npain, and be committed to making the pain go away for E.piphany to get a\nsale. The product also required “top down” selling to senior executives first\nwho would use their authority to mandate agreement/acquiescence from their\nstaffs. In a large enterprise the alternative is working “bottom to top,” up\nfrom low level employees, with each trying to convince the boss, a much\nmore difficult process for costly systems. Further, E.piphany changed the\nstatus quo inside companies. It required several organizations to reconfigure\ntheir business processes and job specs. While an improvement for the\ncompany, change engenders resistance, and resistance creates saboteurs—\nalways an unwelcome surprise.\nThe bad news: multiple “yes” votes were required to get an E.piphany\norder. Other enterprise sales, such as manufacturing-process controls or\ncustomer support, sometimes need endorsement from only one key executive\nor user community to close a deal. With those packages, Information\nTechnology executives personnel generally had input into selection, but the\nactual users enjoyed substantial power in the decision. An E.piphany sale was\ndifferent, since IT wasn’t the driver, but it was an active participant—often\nwith veto power. Likewise, experience showed it was necessary to sell both\n“high” and “wide” on the user and technical sides of an account. After getting\nthrown out of multiple accounts, we built a simple two-by-two matrix that\nshows where support and approval were needed:\nSupport/Approval Matrix (Figure 8.14)\nThis matrix said that even with a visionary executive in an operating\ndivision supporting the E.piphany purchase, it was necessary to sell to four\nconstituencies to close a deal. Without support in an operating division of the\ncompany and IT/tech “approval,” we couldn’t close a deal. Early on, it\nbecame apparent that if the IT organization was determined to derail an\nE.piphany sale, it would often succeed. This insight was a big deal. It was\none of the many “aha’s” that made Epiphany successful. We figured out how\nto solve the problem because a founder and the sales closer were present to\nwitness the initial sales strategy failure, and spent time figuring out how to\npivot the sales strategy.\nEarly sales efforts fell short because they ignored the fact that selling\nE.piphany into the enterprise was different from the sale of other enterprise\nproducts. The most glaring oversight was failure to enlist the support of the\nIT organization. In sales calls, it was easier to get people on the operational\nside excited than it was to excite IT about a suite of applications to serve\nsales, service or marketing. In some cases, E.piphany took the excited\nprospects in operating divisions at their word when they said they could make\nCIO and the IT department “fall into line” and approve the purchase. In other\ncases, necessary steps were skipped and it was assumed that several\nenthusiastic users could do our deal. Rarely did this prove true.\nExample of an Influence Map (Figure 8.15)\nWe assembled that sales failure and success data into an “influence\nmap.” We had already established that a) we needed the support of four\ngroups to get a deal done, b) IT would often be harder to win over than users\nand c) low-level IT personnel would oppose the concept. The critical\nquestion became “How to proceed?” The influence map, as shown in Figure\n8.16, delineates the players and the order in which they need to be convinced\nand sold. Each step leveraged strengths from the step before, using\nmomentum created by groups that liked the company and the products to\novercome objections from groups that didn’t. More often than not,\nshortcutting the process or skipping a sales stage meant losing the sale.\nWhen understood, the Influence Map set the execution strategy for sales.\nCall on: (1) high-level operating executives (VPs, divisional GM’s, etc.) first.\nThen, use that relationship as an introduction to (2) high-level technical\nexecutives (CIO or divisional IT exec), then (3) meet the operational\norganizations’ end users (the people who will use the product), and finally,\n(4) use that groundswell of support to present to, educate, and eliminate\nobjections from the corporate or divisional IT staff.\nCustomer Access Map\nWith the influences understood and written down, turn your attention to\nanswering the perennial sales question of how to get the proverbial foot in the\ndoor. For corporate sales, purchasing or procurement is about the worst\npossible place to start, particularly when offering disruptive innovation.\nVarying with the prospect’s size, corporate sales often require agile\nmaneuvering through different layers or departments to set up meetings with\nthe people identified in the organization and influence maps. Sales calls to\nactual customers help fill in blanks in the access map, adding information and\nsuggesting behavior patterns. Figure 8.16 illustrates an access map in a\ncorporate account.\nFor consumers, finding the right entry to early customers can be equally\ndifficult. Rather than making random calls, think of organizations and\nspecial-interest groups that can be reached inexpensively. Can you reach\ncustomers through organizations they belong to, such as the PTA, book clubs,\nor antique car clubs? Are there web-based groups or meetups that might be\ninterested?\nExample of an Access Map (Figure 8.16)\nSales Strategy\nUnderstanding the influence map is step one in finding a repeatable sales\nprocess.\nLay out your corporate/consumer organization map, influence map and\nyour access map side by side. For a corporate sale, your challenge is to move\nbeyond the names and titles of the people you’ll call on to develop a strategy\nfor approaching them. As you begin to develop a sales strategy, here are\nsome questions to consider:\nAt what level do you enter the account? For example, do you sell high to\nexecutives? Or low to the operational staff?\nHow many people on the organizational map need to say yes for a sale?\nIn what order do you need to call on these people? What’s the script for\neach?\nWhat step can derail the entire sale? Who are the potential saboteur?\nSimilarly, if you were trying to reach twentysomethings with a new\nconsumer product, the questions might be:\nDo you need to get access to a specific demographic segment? For\nexample, do you sell to college students? Parents? Families?\nHow many people need to say, Is this an individual sale or family\ndecision?\nIf this sale requires that multiple members of a family or group agree, in\nwhat order do you need to call on these people? What’s the script for\neach?\nWhat step can derail the entire sale?\nAgain, as you move out into the marketplace to sell your product, you’ll\nlearn what works or not. As predictable patterns emerge, your strategy will\nbecome clear.\nImplementation Plan\nA common first time founder mistake is getting a “thumbs up” from an\nearlyevangelist and opening the Champagne to toast the first sale. As any of\nyou with experience in sales will know, don’t do it yet. Unfortunately, much\ncan happen between the time the decision-maker agrees to make a purchase\nand you actually receive the check. The goal of the implementation plan is to\nwrite down all the things left to happen before the sale is finalized and the\nproduct delivered and to determine who will follow up to manage them. For\nexample:\nDoes the CFO or the CEO or both need to approve the sale?\nDoes the board need to approve the sale?\nDoes Mom or Dad need to approve the sale?\nDoes the customer need to get a loan to finance the sale?\nMust other vendors systems/components be installed and working first?\nChecklist 31: Develop/Refine The Sales Roadmap\nGoal: Who are the company’s customers and how will they purchase your\nproduct?\nReference: Chapter 8, Customer Validation Phase 1: Get Ready to Sell\nSales roadmap developed\nOrganization and influence maps refined\nCustomer Access Map refined\nSales strategy developed\nImplementation plan devised\nTeam members identified to manage each facet of the plan\nExit criteria:\nA thorough plan for getting a foot in the door, making the sale, and\nseeing it through\nGet Ready to Sell: Formalize the Advisory Board\nHopefully, you’ve asked for help from advisers on an informal basis in\ncustomer discovery. In this phase, it’s time to formally engage them. There\nare no hard and fast rules for how large an advisory board should be or\nwhether it should be a “board” at all. Basically, you want two things from\nadvisors: great introductions you can’t get any other way to key customers,\ntalent or investors; and bold, out-of-the-box business model design thinking\nthat will have dramatic impact on your strategy. All the rest is window\ndressing.\nThink strategically, not tactically, about advisors’ reach and sphere of\ninfluence. Recruit only advisors who will make a serious impact on the\ncompany in one way or another—think quality, not quantity. (If you’re\nraising money having a cloud of “impressive names” may help, but don’t\nconfuse them with these people.) Formal advisory board meetings aren’t\nrequired, at least for now, but this process should deliver access to experts\nwho can help.\nBegin by assembling an advisory board road map, much like the\ncollateral roadmap developed earlier. As shown in Table 8.5, the roadmap is\nan organized list of the key advisors needed. (Don’t feel compelled to put\nadvisors in every box on the chart.)\nIn this example, the roadmap differentiates how each advisor will be\nused (technical, business, customer, industry or marketing). Usually, the most\nimportant advisors your startup can have are the ones with “golden\nrolodexes” who can make high-level introductions to early customers,\nchannel partners, or partners who can deliver significant web traffic. Product\nDevelopment may need technical advisors as early as Phase 1 of customer\ndiscovery. The technical advisory board is staffed with advisors from\nacademia or industry who can offer technical advice and pointers to technical\ntalent. As the company begins to sell product, these advisors are used as\ntechnical references for customers.\nWhere possible, particularly in enterprise sales situations, put key\npotential customers on the customer advisory board. These are people met in\ncustomer discovery who can advise about the product from the customer’s\nperspective. I always tell these advisors, “I want you on my advisory board so\nI can learn how to build a product you’ll buy. We both fail if I can’t.” They’ll\nserve as a customer conscience for the product, and later some will be great\nreferences for, or introducers to, other customers. Use them for insight and\none-on-one meetings with the company’s business and Customer\nDevelopment staff—and don’t be afraid to ask them for specific\nintroductions.\nAdvisory Board Roles (Table 8.5)\nTwo other sets of advisors to consider: an industry advisory board of\ndomain experts who bring credibility to the company’s specific market or\ntechnology; and an advisor to the CEO who’s a “been there, done that” CEO\ntype who can bring practical, how-to advice.\nMake sure that, for people that count to you, you\ncount to them.\nThe number of advisors for each domain will obviously vary with\ncircumstances, but there are some rules of thumb. Both sales and marketing\nadvisors tend to have large egos. You can usually only manage only one of\nthem at a time. Industry advisors like to think of themselves as the pundits for\nparticular industries. Have them give you their opinions without being in the\nsame room or showing up on the same day—this allows you to sort through\nwhose advice you want to follow. Business advisors are much like marketing\nadvisors, but some have expertise in different stages of the company.\nConsider keeping a few on hand to make you smarter. Finally, our product\ndevelopment team could never get enough of the technical advisors. They’d\ncome in and make us smarter about specific technical issues. The same was\ntrue for the customer advisors. Be sure to learn something new every time\nthey come by.\nCompensating Advisors\nThe Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffet, says it best: “Make sure that, for\npeople that count to you, you count to them.” That about sums it up. Advisers\ntypically receive common stock without precise correlation to the hours\nthey’ll give your company or exactly what they’ll do to help. The stock\ntypically vests over time, in monthly increments, so it’s easily adjusted based\non the adviser’s value to the company.\nThe best advisors of all pay you to become advisors.\nThey often make a modest cash investment.\nThe best advisors of all pay you to become advisors. They often make a\nmodest cash investment of, say, $20,000 or $100,000 for some of the\ncompany’s preferred stock, and their investment is “boosted” with a generous\nallocation of common shares that pay for the advisory services. Sophisticated\ninvestors recognize the importance of advisors’ willingness to not only lend\ntheir names but also invest some personal cash in what they clearly believe is\na significant opportunity.\nChecklist 32: Formalize Advisory Board\nGoal: Formally engage advisors who can facilitate high-level introductions\nand are top-notch “out of the box” thinkers\nReference: Chapter 8, Customer Validation Phase 1: Get Ready to Sell\nAdvisory board roadmap assembled\nSize – quality vs. quantity\nAbility to make high-level introductions\nTechnical expertise\nMeetings or no meetings?\nKey potential customers\nDomain experts\nA seasoned CEO type\nDecide about compensation\nExit criteria:\nFormal depiction of the size, makeup and operation of the company’s\nadvisory board(s)\n\nCHAPTER 9\nCustomer Validation, Phase Two: Get Out\nof the Building and Sell!\nIN THIS PHASE OF CUSTOMER VALIDATION, it’s time to try to sell. Customer\ndiscovery had you get out of the building twice, first to understand\ncustomers’ problems and how they work and second to determine how well\nthe new product solves that problem. And while you’ve no doubt conducted\nhundreds of tests to iterate and pivot your business model, there is no better\n“pass/fail” test than asking a customer to give you an order or spend time\nwith your app or website.\nIn a physical channel, nothing validates a hypothesis better than a signed\norder, especially when it’s signed before the product is either complete or\nactually shipping. In the web/mobile channel, the equivalent validation is\nattracting users or payers at the rate your hypotheses said you would. (In a\nmulti-sided market, even if you’re getting great traffic and growth, be sure\nthe “other” side, usually the advertisers or payers, are eager to spend to reach\nyour traffic.)\nYour job in this phase is not to scale a revenue plan but to validate your\nbusiness model hypotheses with pass/fail tests that feel an awful lot like\nselling or building web traffic. But revenue or traffic at full scale doesn’t\nhappen until the next step, customer creation. Customer validation is the test\nsales process that—while it makes real sales—is principally aimed at\nanswering a long list of questions, including:\nAre customers enthusiastic about the product’s value proposition?\nDoes the company understand its customer segments and their needs?\nDo customers truly value the product features? Are any key features\nmissing?\nIs the product pricing right, and can the product be sold at a reasonable\ncost?\nWhat’s the purchasing and approval process inside a customer’s\ncompany?\nAre the sales roadmap and channel strategy valid for scaling the sales\nteam?\nAre there enough customers to make this a real business?\n“Get out of the building” means one thing for companies with physical\ngoods or those primarily using the physical channel, and it means something\nradically different for companies in the web/mobile channels. Figure 9.1\nshows the differences..\nIn customer validation, the testing process is a series of elegantly simple\npass/fail tests where the answer is binary, and never “it feels good” or “they\nlike it.” Some examples:\nIf your physical channel business model says...\nyou will close two sales for every 10 sales calls, do you?\nan average customer will buy six widgets in three months, do they?\n$5,000 at spent at a tradeshow (or in direct mail) will generate 25 leads,\ndoes it?\n2/3 of the prospects you pitch will refer you to three friends each, do\nthey?\nHere are the next steps you’ll undertake, by channel:\nSteps for “Get Out of the Building and Sell” by Channel (Figure 9.1)\nGet Out of the Building: Find Earlyvangelists\nThe biggest sales challenge in customer validation is finding the right people\nto call on. This involves first identifying and then spending time with true\nvisionary customers, not mainstream customers. The biggest danger is that\nnot all visionary customers are alike. As a rule, there are visionaries with\nbudgets (we like these) and “strategy,” “long-term planning” or “technical\nvisionary” people without the power to write checks. Table 9.1 describes the\ndifferences. We shouldn’t need to tell entrepreneurs this, but just in case:\nfocus on buyers with checkbooks. They’re called earlyvangelists, as you\nshould know by now.\nEarlyvangelists have budgets, period. And while all visionary customers\nmay recognize they have a problem, only the earlyvangelist candidate is (a)\nmotivated enough to do something about it, (b) perhaps already trying a\nhome-grown solution and, most important, (c) has the clout and the budget to\nsolve the problem. Often, earlyvangelists have already visualized a solution\nsomething like the one being presented. They’re partners in this sales process\nand will often rationalize or explain any missing features to their own\nmanagement. Never ever embarrass or abandon them.\nReview the key earlyvangelist characteristics identified in customer\ndiscovery. Do they point to other, additional prospects? Create a target\nearlyvangelist list and repeat the appointment-generation techniques used in\ncustomer discovery: generate a customer list, an introductory e-mail, and a\nreference story/script. (For a refresher, return to customer discovery Phase 2.)\nEven with thorough preparation, assume one of 20 prospects will engage in\nthe sales process. In other words, be prepared for 95 percent rejection! That’s\nOK; it’s early in the process and 5 percent will do just fine. Of those few,\ndepending on the economic climate, one of three or fewer will actually sign a\npurchase order. That’s a lot of sales calls (which defines a startup). Good\nnews: A sales closer is aboard to handle all the tedium of making contact and\narranging meetings, which founders should always strive to attend.\nDistinguish your earlyvangelist targets from other major customer types,\nincluding early evaluators, scalable customers, and mainstream customers.\nScalable customers may be earlyvangelists as well, but they tend to buy later.\nInstead of buying on a vision, they buy for practical reasons. These will\nbecome target customers in six months but are still more aggressive buyers of\nnew products than mainstream customers.\nFinally, mainstream customers are waiting for the finished product and\ngenerally need an off-the-shelf, no-risk solution. They might say, “We look\nforward to testing your product when it rolls off your production line. We\ndon’t test prototypes.” Remember their names, since they’ll become\ncustomers in one to two years.\nFour Types of Customers (Table 9.1)\nChecklist 33: Find Earlyvangelists\nGoal: Identify passionate early visionaries to try to sell\nReference: Chapter 9, Customer Validation Phase 2: Get Out of the Building\nand Sell!\nEarlyvangelists identified\nAppointments made\nIntroductory email\nReference story\nScript\nHit-rate results tracked\nList of contacts expanded\nExit criteria:\nSales appointments with earlyvangelists\nGet Out of the Building and Test Sell\nBuy a big briefcase and a pile of airplane tickets and kiss the family goodbye,\nsince this validation phase keeps founders on the road, “test-selling” until the\nhypotheses are proved with real orders at or near full price. It’s time to get\nface-to-face with more than a handful of earlyvangelists and try to get some\nearly orders.\nTest Selling\nAnyone can give away or deeply discount a product to get an order, but that\ndoesn’t test true buying intentions. Earlyvangelists see the advantage of\ngetting the new product early, ahead of competitors or envious neighbors.\nThe earlyvangelist by definition should almost leap across the table and grab\nsomeone by the collar to get early access to the product. They need the\nproduct to cure a severe pain or secure a competitive advantage (and over\ntime, they’ll help make the product better). Customer enthusiasm is besttested when the product is sold for as close to full price as you can get. In\nfact, you want to label access to the product as the “early access program”\nand have customers fight to be a part of it. No interest? Then you’ve gotten\nvaluable feedback on how important the product is to people you’ve labeled\nyour most valuable customers.\nAnyone can give away or deeply discount a product\nto get an order.\nThere are two risks in calling on earlyvangelists. One is the request for\ncustomization. Visionary customers might ask for unique extensions or\nmodifications to your standard product. Sometimes these requests are good\nnews. If enough customers ask for the same set of “custom” features, they’re\nnot custom at all, since customers are suggesting the “real” product\nrequirements. The art of being a founder lies in knowing when to incorporate\nthose requests into the spec and declare them features. The danger and\nchallenge is to avoid an inadvertent migration to a custom products business\nwhere all the economics change at a disadvantage to the company.\nThe other earlyvangelist risk is the request for an “exclusive” or a “most\nfavored nations” clause. From the customer point of view, this is a reasonable\nand rational request. “I’m going to take a risk on you, so I want a competitive\nadvantage by being the only one with your product”—an exclusive. Or, “I\nwant the best pricing forever” for being first. Tread very carefully here. Often\nthese are requests from big-company execs with little real-world\nunderstanding of how a startup works. Don’t give up your rights to sell to\nother customers or you’ll end as a development arm of the first company that\nasks you for an exclusive.\nThe Sales Process\nEntrepreneurs, hate “process,” but some basic steps are critical in any\nbusiness-to-business sale. Here’s a primer using enterprise software as the\nmodel:\n1. Start with research: Know the companies and the individuals you’re\ncalling on. Use market and web research to gather data. At a minimum,\nyou should be able to draw their org charts and understand their\nfinancial situations and latest information before making your first sales\npresentation.\n2. First meeting: Use the first meeting to understand the company’s\nproblems, needs, business goals, and the potential “fit” between your\nsolution and their problem. Try to gain a sense of how important your\nproduct might be to the company and how it would go about deploying\nthe product.\n3. Know where to “enter: Get “to the top” as quickly as you can but not\ntoo quickly. Meet one-on-one first with one or several midlevel people,\nand then get in at a high level.\n4. Visualize the “before and after:” Understand how the company solves\nthe problem today and how your product would better solve it. Try to\ndeter mine the return on investment, the ease of adoption and use, and\nhow it will save the company time and money.\n5. Customize your presentations: Do this as early as possible to reflect all\nthe learning above.\n6. Create a purchase action plan: Get the buyer visualizing his purchase\nand use of the product by discussing the sequence of steps, putting dates\nnext to each, and talking about things like the launch date to help make\nthe purchase feel inevitable.\n7. Engage senior management at every opportunity: Introduce your senior\nteam to theirs; wine and dine; build bonds with higher-ups who can\neither approve or kill the deal.\n8. Present a custom proposal and get it signed: Need we say more (other\nthan “celebrate,” of course)? Provide attention and follow-through long\nafter the check clears.\nCollect and Record Sales Findings\nAs you’re out test-selling, collect and collate the findings consistently,\nregardless of who conducts the sales call and whether it happens in a\nStarbucks, an office, or a conference room. If more than one of you is out\ntrying to sell, agree on the key set of facts and feedback to gather on each\ncall. Include objective metrics like “How many will you use?” or “How many\npeople will use it?” as well as subjective comments like “If it works, I’ll\nrecommend it” or “I really like this product better than product X.” Develop a\nconsistent sales-call report card, similar to the one developed in customer\ndiscovery, to record responses consistently. End every report card by\nanswering four identical “buy” questions:\nIs a purchase order in hand or on the way?\nHow many units (or dollars’ worth) will the customer purchase?\nWhat’s needed to get a deal signed?\nWhen might the deal be signed?\nFor best results, record detailed notes in the parking lot, after the\nmeeting, when details are freshest. Identify follow-up opportunities, action\nitems, and other people to see either at the company or at others the prospect\nmay have mentioned. Note any competitive products discussed. Then drive\non to the next test-sales session. Remember to send a thank-you note\nconfirming details and next steps.\nWhile answers other than a purchase order are rarely binding on the\nbuyer, you should get a good sense of the product’s sales potential.\nAggregate the numbers to create a “probability-adjusted sales forecast,” a\n“best guess” of how many dollars will come in and when. In the customer\nvalidation step, many of your initial visits won’t deliver short-term orders.\nThat doesn’t make the meetings unimportant. Remember, the primary goal is\ncustomer feedback, not sales.\nWithout a doubt, everyone (including your board!) will focus on the\nsales forecast. Try to uncover more about the value proposition, competitive\nsituation, pricing and, most important, whom to call on and in what order to\nmake a sale.\nUnderstanding why customers said no is more\nimportant than understanding why they said yes.\nUnderstand where in the process turndowns\nhappen...\nCreate a spreadsheet summary for the data, making sure to allow plenty\nof room for the comments, which are often most valuable of all. Weight the\ncomments and ratings based on the customer’s size or potential volume. Keep\nvery close tabs on win/loss statistics on sales calls. Understanding why\ncustomers said no is more important in this step than understanding why they\nsaid yes. Understand where in the process turndowns happen (introduction,\nproduct presentation, organizational issues, not-invented-here issues,\ntechnical issues, pricing) to help refine the sales roadmap.\nThe Pivot\nAs optimistic as a startup may be, the most likely outcome of the first sales\npush is either no orders at all, or far fewer than you expected. Typically there\nare two root causes:\nThe company hasn’t found earlyvangelists and needs to keep searching\nin the current customer segment or abandon it and explore others\nOther parts of the business model just aren’t compelling, whether it’s\nproduct, features, benefits, price, issues, partners or several\nEither way, you need to stop and think about why what you thought\nwould happen didn’t happen. This test-selling effort is still a learning\nexercise. This is when you go back to your business model canvas and review\nthe hypotheses you assembled in discovery. If you can’t get early orders now,\nclearly some were wrong. Did you pick the wrong customer segment? Did\nthe value proposition not match this segment? Did the revenue model not fit\ntheir budget? The business model canvas provides a visual way to diagnose\nwhat went wrong and what you can change and test.\nHow Many Orders Do I Need to Prove Validation?\nOne of the first questions founders ask is, “So how many orders do I need to\nvalidate my business model?” While we’d like to tell you the number is 7, it’s\nmore complicated than that.\nYou and your board of directors do need to agree\non a number.\nIf you’re selling million-dollar enterprise software packages, three to\nfive repeatable sales from the same customer segment may give you a good\nindication that it’s time to scale a professional sales organization.\nHowever, if you’re selling new kitchenware or appliances through a\nconsumer retail channel, you won’t know if you have it right until the\nchannel puts in a reorder.\nThere’s no one magic number. But you and your board of directors do\nneed to agree on a number. You and your investors always need to be in sync\nabout what the criteria are for scaling and the cash burn rate resulting from\nthat decision.\nChecklist 34: Get Out of the Building and Sell!\nGoal: Test sell the product\nReference: Chapter 9, Customer Validation Part 2: Get Out of the Building\nand Sell!\nReport card for collecting sales findings\nFirst meeting understanding: agenda, goals\nAgree on plan to enter at the right level\n“Before” and “after” visualized\nCustomized presentations\nPurchase action plan (after positive meeting)\nSenior management engaged\nThank-you note with next steps\nCustom proposal (signed)\nSpreadsheet of win/loss statistics, summarized data\nAgreed-upon number of orders to prove validation\nExit criteria: A realistic sense of the product’s sales potential\nPass/Fail tests identified (orders to prove validation)\nGet Out of the Building: Refine the Sales Roadmap\nYou developed your Sales Roadmap earlier on page 344. In this section\nyou’ll continue to refine it. Only when a team follows the same path through\na company and it results in sales over and over again does the road-map\nhypothesis become fact.\nCompany and Consumer Organization\nStartups making sales calls on corporations find that a pattern emerges.\nCompanies don’t have hundreds of types of org charts but tend to be\norganized in one of four ways: by product in operating divisions; functionally\n(engineering, marketing, sales, etc.); as a matrix organization by both\nfunction and product; or as a distributed franchise. This makes finding the\nrepeatable path, and cracking the corporate sales roadmap much easier for an\nentrepreneur. So first figure out which of the four types you’re calling on.\nThe approach is different for consumer products. Consumers may be\norganized by archetype, demographics, phychographics or “jobs they want\ndone.” When trying to reach twentysomethings with a new product, for\nexample, questions might include:\nIs access to a specific demographic segment required? Should the focus\nbe college students? Parents? Families? Athletes?\nHow many people have to say yes to close a sale? Is this an individual or\nfamily decision?\nIf this sale requires that multiple members of a family or group agree, is\nthere a logical or helpful sequence to use? What’s the script for each?\nWhat steps can derail the entire sale?\nTypical Influence Map in a Company Organized by Function\n(Figure 9.2)\nUsing the Organization Chart to Build an Influence\nMap\nFirst, get a copy of the company’s organization chart. If you can’t get one,\nfigure it out by talking to multiple low-level employees. Then map the org\nchart into an “influence map,” a map that let you diagram and navigate\nfriends and foes within a corporation. An influence map starts with the org\nchart. Next, locate your earlyvangelist on the chart—the person whose\nproblem your product solves. Then use the information you’ve gathered in\nmultiple sales calls to figure out who the influencers, recommenders,\nsaboteurs and economic buyers are (see Chapter 3). In the example in Figure\n9.2, the company is organized functionally. CFO Karen Rogers is the\nearlyvangelist. It’s her decision to buy your early, buggy unfinished\nenterprise financial software. Her two direct reports, Neil and Suzanne, will\ninfluence her. But before Karen will buy, two in-house competitors must be\nat least neutralized if not won over: the financial-modeling and toolsdevelopment staffers in the sales and IT departments. In addition, their bosses\n—the CIO and the sales VP—will weigh in before Karen can get her CEO to\nsign off on the purchase.\nDraw the influence map of each earlyvangelist you call on, looking for\ncommon patterns. As repeatable patterns emerge, sales will come quicker and\neasier.\nYour customers will teach you how to sell to them.\nRefine the Core Strategy\nEarlier, you developed Figure 8.3, and learned that you needed to win the\nsupport of four groups to get a deal done. Winning a high-level executive\nsponsor and buy-in was the top priority (in this case it was the CFO as the\nearlyvangelist with a budget), followed by using that enthusiasm to generate\nsupport from the CIO. With those approvals in hand, next came support from\nend users (who work for the CFO) and finally support from the IT staff who\nwork for the CIO.\nCore Strategy (Figure 9.3)\nRefine the Access Map\nHow do you get into a potential corporate account? Whom should you call on\nfirst? The most senior executive? While entrepreneurs’ instinct is to get to the\nmost important and highest-level executives they can find, keep in mind that\nyou usually don’t get multiple meetings with “C-level” executives. Practice\nby calling on lower-level employees until you’re certain you understand you\nhave a product/ market fit.\nAfter multiple sales calls on a variety of companies, your startup should\nhave learned which department or departments it should call on first to gain\ninterest and entry. Once inside the account, summarize the company’s needs,\nassemble a sales strategy, present a solution, and work to sell the account.\nFigure 9.4 is an example of an Access Strategy Map.\nKey patterns to watch for:\nWho should you call on first at a prospect to make a sale fastest?\nWho else at the prospect needs to be called on, and in what sequence?\nWho will need to approve the sale, and how long will the process take?\nWho influences the decision, positively or negatively, and how do you\napproach them?\nExample of an Access Strategy Map (Figure 9.4)\nUse the selling-strategy map to answer a wide range of questions,\nincluding:\nAt what level do we enter the account? High-level executives or\noperational staff?\nHow many people on the organizational map need to say yes in order to\nmake a sale?\nDoes each department perceive and care about the customer problem the\nsame way?\nWhich executives can influence or sabotage the sale?\nIn what order should people be called on? How do the scripts vary for\neach?\nHow much purchasing authority does each level you’re dealing with\nhave? Are they authorized to sign for $1,000? For $100,000? Do they\nneed anyone else’s approval to deploy a product across their\ndepartments or divisions or to their customers?\nDiagram the people involved in a business-to-business sale to identify\nthe buyer, influencers, in-house competitors and issues that need to be\naddressed before a sale is made. See the example of an organizational map\nand a selling-strategy map below. Use the tools that make the most sense for\nthe situation.\nKeep refining the access strategy map by making sales calls until a\npredictable, repeatable pattern emerges that will work equally well when the\ncompany has 20 or 30 field salespeople instead of two or three. As the pattern\nemerges, the selling strategy will, too. You’re not done until clear common\nthreads have been found. If there aren’t any common threads, get back out\ninto the field and make even more test-sales calls until a series of purchase\norders and patterns emerge. Keep a keen eye out for “danger” patterns that\nmay include:\ntesting or demo requirements before a sale is considered\nformal RFP, bidding processes or timetables affecting new-product\nconsideration\ncompanies requiring that all initial presentations be made only to the\npurchasing department\ncompanies that refuse to buy from startups (sometimes the case in\nenterprise software)\nExample of a Sales Roadmap (Figure 9.5)\nDevelop a Sales Roadmap\nThe ultimate goal of this exercise is to develop a sales roadmap. This is a\ndetailed diagram of how to get repeatable orders that you, the founder, hand\nto a professional sales VP. It’s the playbook for the repeatable, scalable sales\nprocess. It details every step, every presentation, every e-mail and price, and\nevery move you’ve learned for getting an order. You write it up as a flow\nchart and document each step. Your hiring test of the competence of\nprospective sales VPs will be whether they discard it and go back to their old\nrolodex or if they use it and refine it.\nIt’s not sold until the check clears.\nThe selling process seldom ends when the visionary customer says, “Thumbs\nup, I’ll buy.” Particularly in business-to-business sales (as well as sales where\nhusband and wife must agree), much can happen between the agreement to\nbuy and the arrival of the check. Recognize and identify any steps required\nbefore the sale is completed and the product is delivered and paid for.\nDetermine who follows up to manage the process.\nFor example:\nDo the CFO and/or CEO need to approve?\nDoes the board or procurement group need to approve?\nDoes Mom or Dad need to weigh in?\nIs there a budget cycle, lease or loan requirement in the cycle?\nMust the company be an approved vendor?\nAre there other systems/components from other vendors? Or other\ndependencies like rewiring, adequate power supply, or a renovation that\nhave to happen first?\nChecklist 35: Refine the Sales Roadmap\nGoal: Develop an effective sales process\nReference: Chapter 9, Customer Validation Part 2: Get Out of the Building\nand Sell!\nCorporate organization and influence maps\nInfluencers, recommenders, saboteurs, economic buyers ID’d\nSelling strategy map\nHow account is entered\nWho is called on\nOrder of calls\nPresentation\nFlowchart depicting sales process\nSteps identified to completing sale, delivering product\nExit criteria: Playbook for a repeatable and scalable sales process\nPass/Fail tests identified\nGet Out of the Building: Test Sell Channel Partners\nIf you sell through an indirect sales channel, now is the time to validate the\nchannel strategy you assembled in Phase 1. Validation means an order or at\nleast a firm commitment from prospective partners in your sales channel.\n(Trying to get orders from channel partners earlier, without enthusiastic\nend users, would have been counterproductive. The typical channel partner\nresponse: “That sounds interesting, but will there be any demand for this\nproduct? What do potential customers think?” What the prospective channel\npartner was really asking: “Can I make money from this product? If so, how\nmuch?” With actual sales and reports of enthusiasm from their customers, the\nanswers are far more credible.)\nAt each meeting, try to learn as much as possible about the potential\nchannel partner:\nWill the channel partner buy and sell the product, based on its value\nproposition, proposed pricing, and terms?\nWhat percentage of the product’s retail price will the channel require?\nAre there other costs such as freight, advertising, or promotion? What’s\nthe return policy?\nDoes the channel partner have any sense of potential sales volume?\nWhere and how will the partner promote or merchandise the product?\nHow can the channel be influenced to sell more: bonuses, training for\nsalespeople, sales meetings or product demonstrations, a golf\ntournament? What means of encouraging more sales through the channel\nare acceptable and affordable?\nWill the channel target buy and sell the product, based on its value\nproposition, proposed pricing, and terms?\nWhat percentage of the product’s retail price will the channel require?\nAre there other costs, such as freight, advertising, or promotion? What’s\nthe return policy?\nDoes the partner have any sense of potential sales volume? Where and\nhow will the partner promote or merchandise the product?\nAnd the most important... does the channel partner create demand or just\nfulfill it, when customers seek out the product.\nSometimes these discussions lead to an early channel stocking order. If\nso, congratulations. Make it happen. The initial order may be a test market in\na few stores or a region, or a small quantity “to see how it sells.” Seize this\nopportunity, knowing that your primary mission is to learn as much as\npossible about the channel, assuring everyone that when the product is ready,\nit can actually get to market.\nIdentify the Channel Targets\nTest prospective channel partners of varying sizes and types. Just like\nlistening to customers, founders should lead the charge in each channel so\nthat they hear reactions firsthand.\nBegin by making lists of the key people to see in each targeted channel,\nincluding contact information and everything known about the target (drawn\nfrom customer discovery research). Getting that first appointment with a\nnational chain is a hard, low-percentage game, so prepare to be disappointed,\npersistent, and tenacious.\nPosition the meetings as informational in nature, and be prepared to fly\nhalfway across the country for 20-minute meetings on regular basis. (One\nnational chain buyer is known to turn over a three-minute egg timer at the\nstart of sales pitches.)\nWhere the channel involves retailers, validation is a bit tricky. When\nwill the product be available in sufficient volume for the retailer to actually\nbuy it? Will the partner agree to a limited test market sooner, hoping testmarket success leads to far larger, chain-wide orders?\nChannel validation also includes meetings with independent sales reps\nand distributors. Independent reps have a keen sense of their markets and\nusually have a handful of key retail or chain customers whose buying\npreferences and patterns they know well, largely because their income\ndepends on it. Talk with these folks in multiple markets. Will the industry’s\nNo. 1 or 2 rep firm in the region take the product on and sell it once it\nbecomes available? This is hardly a given, since reps can rarely carry\ncompetitive products. What’s the rep’s sense of his key customers’ potential\nfor buying and marketing the product? How long will it take to get\ndistribution, and what kind of volume might the startup expect? Meet with\ndistributors to discuss the same issues.\nA Channel Is Just a Grocery Shelf\nOne caveat in channel discussions: never confuse channel partners with\ncustomers. Persuading a partner to carry the product, or a big system\nintegrator to work with your company, is decidedly not the same as getting a\ncustomer to buy. While channel partners may place product orders, they order\nonly when customer demand pulls the product through their channel. End\nusers pay the bills; channel partners take your company seriously only when\nyou drive their revenue.\nNever confuse channel partners with customers.\nThe best introduction to a channel partner begins with “we may have\ncustomers for you.” While this seems blindingly obvious, lots of startups fall\ninto the trap of thinking their sales problems are over once a channel partner\nsigns up, or they pop the Champagne corks when the first “stocking” order\narrives from an indirect-channel partner. Wrong. Think of all indirect\nchannels as nothing more than shelves in a grocery store. Until customers\nbecome familiar with the brand, they’ll never search for the product. Until\nthey pick it up, it isn’t sold. And just like retailers, channel partners are\nnotoriously slow to pay their bills.\nKeeping all this in mind, update the channel/service partner presentation\nwith information about early customer orders. Then hit the street and present\nto them. The goal is to come back with a committed relationship (usually\nevidenced by an order). Create a channel sales-call “report card” similar to\nthe sales report card, and use it to estimate sales that might eventually come\nfrom the channel. At this stage, channel-volume estimates will be difficult,\nbut you have to start somewhere!\nChecklist 36: Test Sell Channel Partners\nGoal: Validate your channel strategy\nReference: Chapter 9, Customer Validation Part 2: Get Out of the Building\nand Sell!\nChannel targets identified and researched\nMeetings scheduled\nIntroductory e-mail\nReference story and script\nChannel/service partner presentation updated with early channel\norders\nReport card for estimating sales from each channel\nSpreadsheet for summarizing data\nExit criteria\nOrders or firm commitments from prospective channel partners\nSales estimates from each channel\nPass/Fail tests identified\n\nCHAPTER 10\nCustomer Validation, Phase Three: Develop\nProduct and Company Positioning\nIN THIS PHASE OF CUSTOMER VALIDATION, you’ll use all the test results from\nyour experiments about customers, their reactions to the initial value\nproposition, and why they buy. The result is two positioning statements: one\nfor the company and one for the product. In this phase, you’ll:\ndevelop product positioning\nmatch product positioning to market type\ndevelop a company positioning\nmake presentations to analysts and industry influencers to validate the\npositioning\nPositioning is the attempt to control the public’s perception of a product\nor service as it relates to competitive products. In Phase 1 of validation, you\ncrafted initial positioning for product and company, but formal positioning at\nthat time would have involved too much guesswork. Now, with 50 or 250\nface-to-face customer interviews and thousands of online customer\ninteractions under your belt, the company has real facts about why customers\nbuy and real customers to help further test and refine your positioning.\nThus far, even through the validation stage, spending on customer\nacquisition has been modest and the risks relatively low. But now, as the\ncompany prepares to scale from dozens or hundreds of customers to\nthousands or even millions, it needs to be able to communicate what the\nproduct is and does, and why the customer should buy or use it.\nNo PR Agency\nMost technology-driven startups believe they need professional “marketing\npeople” from a public relations agency to execute this positioning phase. In\nreality, the first pass is best-done (and far more affordably) by the Customer\nDevelopment team with feedback from Product Development. At this\nmoment, no one is closer to the customer or better understands what\nproblems customers say the product solves. No one else has struggled to learn\ncustomers needs, get an order, and find a repeatable sales process. The\nCustomer Development team is clearly best-qualified to develop a first pass\nat describing what makes the company and the product unique. Later, during\ncustomer creation, it’ll be time to bring in the “experts” and their monthly\nretainers and invoices. By then you’ll be able to hand them facts explaining\nwhy customers bought.\nThe Positioning Audit\nBefore the company spends time on positioning, it’s a good idea to air out the\nconference room and get some facts. The best way to do this is with a\npositioning audit. An audit is an unbiased way to learn how others perceive\nyour company and products. An external audit interviews a representative\nsample of people from a variety of categories, including customers who know\nor have heard of your company and those who don’t; others who will carry\nyour message for you (industry analysts and influencers, bloggers, members\nof the press, and others); competitors and others who are knowledgeable\nabout the industry or market.\n\nExample of an External Audit Questionnaire (Figure 10.1)\nEach interview asks these groups a series of questions about how they\nperceive your company and its key competitors: Do they know and respect\nyour product, your reputation, and your leadership? Do they think your\ncompany is a credible, trustworthy provider of the product or service it’s\nselling, and where do they think it fits in the competitive set? The results\nform a baseline of the perceptions others have about your company.\nForm a baseline of the perceptions others have\nabout your company.\nOnce you understand what others think (usually a surprise to most\nstartups breathing the rarefied air of their own conference rooms), the\ncompany can work on changing and shaping those opinions. An example of\nan external audit questionnaire for customers, press, influencers, and analysts\nis shown in Figure 10.1.\nWhile conducting an audit is the kind of activity pr agencies excel at,\nhanding this function off completely is a serious mistake in a startup. Just as\nyour early sales calls were too important to be handled by salespeople, your\nearly audits are too important to be handed off to a pr agency. The members\nof the founding team should at least perform the first five or ten calls\nthemselves.\nListening to external perceptions of the company is half of this audit\nstep. Listening inside the company is the other half. An internal audit directs\nthe same questions to the founding team executive staff and board members.\nMost startups assume they have complete internal unanimity on the all the\nissues in the external audit. An internal audit will probably reveal that you\nhave a cacophony of voices (and you most definitely don’t want to be out of\nsync with your investors.) The internal audit should unearth those differences\nand extract new ideas. When the company has agreed on a final positioning at\nthe end of this phase, you communicate those ideas back to the entire\norganization so it speaks with one voice.\nDevelop Positioning: Product Positioning\nIn this step you’ll put a stake in the ground and formalize the product’s\npositioning. The positioning doesn’t have to be perfect, since it will be\nrefined further during customer creation. The result of this productpositioning step is a one-page “product positioning brief” that updates the\npositioning briefs developed earlier. As sales literature (data sheets, sales\npresentations, website and copy) and marketing campaigns are created, this\nbrief should be used to keep all the messages “on point.”\nFeedback from customers and channel partners in customer discovery\nand customer validation has continually refined or affirmed the answer to\nwhat your positioning is. You wrote your first version of a positioning\nstatement when you created the sales presentation, answering the question of\nwhy an early customer should buy the product. Think about customers’\nreaction to that description. Did it generate excitement? Was it credible? If\ncustomers couldn’t or didn’t explain why the product was interesting to them\n—or not—do you understand why? If not, re-contact them and find out the\nreasons. There’s no better input into product positioning than feedback from\nfolks who were exposed to the product itself.\nThe Product Positioning Brief\nReturn to the simple, single-phrase positioning statement you developed at\nthe outset of customer validation (remember “Absolutely positively\novernight” from FedEx?). Did it resonate with the customers encountered\nduring the validation process? Did they find think it explained why they\nshould buy the product or what it did, and did they find it credible and\neffective? If not, back to the drawing board.\nTo refresh your memory, review product positioning example developed\nin Chapter 8 (which may have been several months ago by now):\nExample of Product Positioning (Figure 10.2)\nA thorough positioning effort made soon after customer-validation\ninterviews will often save the company time and money at the start of\ncustomer creation. If it already knows how to position the new product\nagainst competition in a way that resonates with customers, it can hire a pr or\nmarketing communications agency and have it get right to work creating buzz\nor promotional materials or both. Neither time nor dollars are wasted on\nponderous, costly positioning studies and analyses. Instead, the agency is told\n“here’s the positioning. Run with it unless you have a significantly better\nidea.” The agency will know how to package the product, the pr messages,\nand other marketing communications tools and can get right to work\ngenerating results. (Agencies hate this, because thinking and “strategizing”\nare far more lucrative and less accountable activities.)\nProduct Positioning by Market Type (Table 10.3)\nChecklist 37: Develop Product Positioning\nGoal: Formalize your product’s positioning by Market Type\nReference: Chapter 10, Customer Validation, Phase 3: Product Development\nand Company Positioning\nInitial product positioning brief reviewed\nCustomer feedback factored in\nProduct positioning updated and refined\nExit criteria:\nRevised product positioning brief\nDevelop Positioning: Match Positioning to Market\nType\nMarket type dramatically changes the messages your company wants to send\nabout itself and its products. So now it’s time to match the positioning to the\nmarket type you’ve selected.\nFor an Existing Market\nIf you’re entering an existing market, company positioning is about creating\nthe notion that your company is both different and credible. And solves a\nproblem that customers believe is important. When Apple entered the\nsmartphone market, people understood that the company was a manufacturer\nof iPods but was now going to offer a phone and a web browser, too.\nOnce your company positioning is chosen, product positioning follows.\nSince in an existing market comparable products exist, product positioning\ntypically describes how and why your product is different along an existing\naxis/basis of competition. Differentiation in an existing market can take one\nof three forms: you can describe differences in product attributes (faster,\ncheaper, less filling, 30 percent more), in distribution channel (pizza in 30\nminutes, home delivery, see your nearest dealer, build it yourself on the web),\nor in service (five-year, 50,000-mile automobile warranty, 90-day moneyback guarantee, lifetime warranty). Or it can take the form of how the product\nfills a need or solves a problem the customer was searching for.\nFor a New Market\nIf you’re creating a new market, company positioning can’t be about how\ndifferent your company is, since by definition there are no other companies to\ncompare it with in a new market. So in a new market, company positioning is\nabout communicating a vision of and passion for what could be. It answers\nthe questions “What’s wrong with the world that you want to make right?”\nand “What is it that your company is trying to change?” When Airbnb\nreinvented hotel/motel/bed and breakfasts with “peer-to-peer”\naccommodations, they first had to communicate a radical idea: people would\nwant to rent out their homes to strangers who would want to stay in other\nstrangers’ homes.\nAfter positioning the company, positioning the product in a new market\nbecomes pretty simple. Touting a new product’s features is unproductive,\nsince there’s no context for understanding them—no comparable products\nexist—and customers have no idea what you’re talking about. If Airbnb had\npositioned its service as “rooms for $89” or “sleep in a stranger’s bed” no one\nwould have had a clue what it was talking about. Instead, Airbnb positioning\ntalked about a “sharing economy” and emphasized the economic benefits for\nboth parties.\nIn a Clone Market\nCloning a business model from the U.S. that hasn’t made it to your country\n(due to language, cultural or legal barriers) is a viable business strategy.\nClones are typically found in countries such as China, Russia, Brazil, India\nand Indonesia that are large enough to grow companies to substantial size\n(greater than 100 million people).\nCompany positioning can’t be about how different your company is, as\nthere are no other companies in your country to compare it with, but you can\nact as if you can predict the future. You know how the equivalent companies\nare positioned in the U.S. Clone their positioning.\nThe same is true for product positioning. Touting a new product’s\nfeatures is unproductive at first, as there’s no immediate context for\nunderstanding the features—no comparable products exist—and customers\nhave no idea what you’re talking about. But here again you can pretend to be\npsychic. You know how the equivalent companies are positioned in the U.S.\nAs soon as the market is educated, clone their positioning.\nFor Re-Segmenting a Market\nIf you’re re-segmenting an existing market, company positioning depends on\nmarket segmentation. Segmentation means you’ve picked a clear and distinct\nspot in customers’ minds that’s unique and understandable. Most important,\nconcerns something they value and want and need now. Company positioning\nfor this market type communicates your deep understanding of customer\nproblems/needs for un-or underserved markets. And your astute\nunderstanding of how to uniquely solve it.\nThere are two types of market re-segmentation; a segmented niche and a\nlow-cost provider. Two examples of low-cost re-segmentation are Jetblue and\nSouthwest Airlines. Both offer cheap fares matched by minimal frills, they\nentered the airline business low-cost passenger airlines that provide highquality customer service on point-to-point routes.\nThere are two types of market re-segmentation; a\nsegmented niche and a low-cost provider.\nThe rise of Walmart was another example of an entrepreneur’s\nrecognition that an existing market was ripe for a niche re-segmentation. In\nthe 1960s and ’70s, Sears and Kmart dominated big-box discount retailing,\nopening large stores where there was sufficient population to sustain them.\nSmaller communities got catalog stores (Sears) or were simply ignored\n(Kmart). Sam Walton saw towns dismissed as “too small” as an opportunity.\n“Small towns first” was his unique niche re-segmentation. Once established,\nWalmart proudly positioned itself as a “discounter”—a sobriquet the large\nretailers avoided like the plague. They sold name-brand health and beauty\naids at cost. This strategy, supported by heavy advertising, pulled in\ncustomers who then bought other products which, while priced low, carried\nhigh gross margins. Equally important, Walmart adoption of cutting-edge\ntechnology to track how people shop and to buy, and its ability to deliver\ngoods more efficiently and cheaply reduced its cost of sales to a small\nfraction of competitors’. By 2002, Kmart was bankrupt and Walmart was the\nlargest company in the world.\nWhen you’re re-segmenting a market, product positioning is a hybrid of\nmarket and existing market positionings. Since your segmentation has moved\nyour product into a space adjacent to your competitors, product positioning\ndescribes how and why your new segment is different and important to your\ncustomers.\nChecklist 38: Match Positioning To Market Type\nGoal: Ensure product positioning matches company’s market type\nReference: Chapter 10, Customer Validation, Phase 3: Product Development\nand Company Positioning\nExisting and Re-segmented Markets: Product compared to its\ncompetitors’\nNew Market: Vision and passion of what could be communicated\nClone Market: Knowledge of comparative firms used to “predict the\nfuture”\nExit criteria:\nEnsure product position matches market type\nValidate positioning with customers\nDevelop Positioning: Company Positioning\nWith the product positioned in one of the four market types, articulate\ncompany positioning the same way. What’s the difference between product\npositioning and company positioning? Product positioning focused on the\nspecific product attributes within a market type, while company positioning\nanswers the questions “What does this company do for me?” and “Why do I\nwant to do business with them?” and “Why does this company exist and how\nis it different?”\nWrite the first version of a company positioning statement as simply as\npossible, always keeping customers in mind. Describe the company to\nencourage potential customers to say, “Tell me more. It sounds like you’re\nsolving a problem I have.”\nHere’s a great but verbose example from Amazon.com: “We seek to be\nEarth’s most customer-centric company for three primary customer sets:\nconsumer customers, seller customers, and developer customers.” UPS points\nto its breadth: “As the world’s largest package delivery company and a\nleading global provider of specialized transportation and logistics services,\nUPS continues to develop the frontiers of logistics, supply chain\nmanagement, and e-Commerce, ...combining the flows of goods, information,\nand funds.” One more, from the simpler, more narrowly focused Zappos,\nspeaks volumes about why you’d want to do business with the company:\n“We’ve aligned the entire organization around one mission: to provide the\nbest customer service possible. Internally, we call this our WOW\nphilosophy.” Notice, that company positioning is not about product or\nfeatures.\nSometimes, founders creating a new market are tempted to name the\nnew market. This can be helpful or, more often, dangerous and expensive.\nGenerally it’s helpful only if it helps explain the product’s attributes, with\nterms like handheld video game or instant photography. If the new market\nname is cute or esoteric, prepare to spend lots of money explaining the\nmarket and why it’s important to customers, who need a frame of reference to\nunderstand the company positioning. No-frills airlines and movies on demand\nexplain markets and position new companies within them. Tivo spent\nhundreds of millions convincing customers it wasn’t a digital VCR.\nTable 10.2 illustrates company positioning by market type. Like product\npositioning, company positioning doesn’t have to be perfect yet, since it will\nbe refined further during customer creation.\nCompany Positioning by Market Type (Table 10.2)\nAs with product positioning, the result of this exercise should be a\n“company positioning brief,” brief being the operative word. As marketing\nliterature (press backgrounder, sales presentations, website) unfolds, this brief\nwill be used in conjunction with the product brief for consistency’s sake.\nAs a consistency check for company positioning, revisit the mission\nstatement written during customer discovery. How did customers react to it\nduring validation interviews? Did they find that explained why the company\nis different or special and encourage them to do business with the company?\nIn addition, compare the company’s description and mission statement with\nthose of its competitors. What are their company positionings, and is the new\ncompany’s positioning distinct or differentiated, particularly as buyers are\nconcerned. Is it simple? Beware: unsubstantiated superlatives like easiest,\nbest and greatest are meaningless. Demonstrable, provable claims like fastest\nand cheapest are stronger, although cheapest is a high-risk strategy as a rule,\nsince competition can quickly respond.\nUnsubstantiated superlatives like easiest, best and\ngreatest are meaningless. Demonstrable, provable\nclaims like fastest and cheapest are stronger.\nChecklist 39: Develop Company Positioning\nGoal: Articulate Company Positioning\nReference: Chapter 10, Customer Validation, Phase 3: Product Development\nand Company Positioning\nMission statement developed in Customer Discovery revisited\nCompany description, mission statement compared to competitors’\nCompany positioning statement drafted\nSimple\nKeeps customers in mind\nWhat Company does for me\nWhy do I want to do business with them?\nWhy does this company exist and how is it different?\nMatched to Market Type\nExit criteria:\nStatement that fully articulates the Company’s vision and mission\nDevelop Positioning: Validate Positioning\nIndustry analysts and influencers help deliver the foundation of credibility\nthat a startup needs. What’s an industry analyst? In the technology arena,\nmany firms charge customers to provide an “independent” and dispassionate\nanalysis of markets, trends, or specific products and their fit in those markets.\nThese firms vary in size and influence. In some technical markets (enterprise\nsoftware, for example) sales to large companies are very difficult until one of\nthe large analyst firms (Gartner, Forrester, Yankee) has blessed the product,\nparticularly if it’s new. In the entertainment business it might be Kagan, in\nconsumer products the NPD group.\nUnlike analysts, industry influencers are a less formal category. Every\nindustry has a handful of pundits who publish articles, write blogs or hold\nconferences, and their prominence in the field influences what gets talked\nabout. Sometimes these influentials work at industry-leading companies but\nspeak at lots of conferences. Other influentials include writers at general,\nbusiness, or trade publications. Sometimes they teach at universities.\nTest to see if they’ll sing your company song.\nIdentification of key analysts and industry influencers began in customer\ndiscovery. Meet them and get their insights and feedback on the initial\npositioning (market, product, and company) just created and their thoughts\nabout product features. Test to see if they’ll sing your company song (and if\nnot, figure out why). Even though early adopters will be evangelizing the\nproduct inside their company or to their friends and family, it helps to have\nother “outsiders” who will say, “Yes, we’ve heard of them, and while it’s too\nearly to say how good their product is, we think their idea is quite valuable.”\nIt’s also important to line up industry analysts and influencers as references\nfor press interactions in the customer creation step.\nAll this would have been difficult without real customer contacts,\nfeedback, and orders, but now it’s appropriate to contact the analysts and\ninfluencers who have been tracked since early on in customer discovery.\nHopefully, their names were recorded in a database after the company met\nthem at conferences, seminars, and trade shows. Before any meeting, the\nteam should spend time understanding their opinions on the market and\nproduct space (if not, don’t use the meetings in this phase to get up to speed;\ndo the homework first).\nBefore contacting analysts and influencers, be sure to understand what\ncompanies and industries their firms cover and what particular area or\ncompanies the individual analysts cover. (There’s nothing worse than seeing\nthe wrong person or even the wrong company. It tells everyone that nobody\ndid their homework.) Develop a short script explaining why they should\nmeet. Understand what they cover and explain why the new company will\nshake up their market and why the product and company are important. With\nthis accomplished, the “what’s in it for them” is obvious; they won’t want to\nmiss an influential and important company. (They’ll almost certainly also try\nto sell their consulting services, which at least theoretically have no bearing\non their opinion about the new client’s product.) Make sure to reference early\ncustomers and the problem/pain points that the product solves for them.\nWhen they agree to meet, ask how much time they’ll allocate, what\npresentation format they like (formal slides, demo, whiteboard talk, etc.) and\nwhether the presentation should focus on technology, markets, customers,\nproblems, or all the above.\nEach analyst organization or influencer has a view\nof the market or products it covers.\nAssemble the presentation, keeping in mind this isn’t a sales pitch.\nFocus on market and product positioning as well as details of product\nfeatures. The objective is to validate the product and company positions and,\nwherever possible, to influence analysts’ thinking, not to sell them. Each\nanalyst organization or influencer has a view of the market or products it\ncovers—understand that view upfront (know it well enough to draw it on the\nboard). If creating a new market, get the slides describing its view of the\nadjacent markets it will affect.\nMeeting an industry influencer may require the same formal preparation\nas meeting an analyst, or it may be a lunch at a nearby pub. Do the homework\nto understand how the influencers acquire and disseminate information\nupfront, and adjust presentation length and style accordingly.\nWhen meeting influencers and analysts, remember that the goal is to\ngather feedback (and hope for wild enthusiasm). Also use the interaction to\ngather intelligence about the marketplace. Make a mental checklist of critical\nlearning objectives. For example:\nWhat other companies are doing anything similar?\nHow does the new company’s vision fit with market needs?\nWith customer needs?\nHow can the company best position its product, its place in the market,\nand the company itself?\nIs the product pricing right?\nHow does it compare with competitors’ pricing?\nThe analysts can often clarify who in a company the sale should be\nmade to and the kinds of obstacles that will be faced. With feedback from\nanalysts and influencers as well several real customers, continue to the next\nand final phase of customer validation.\nChecklist 40: Validate Positioning\nGoal: Validate product and company positioning, and product features\nReference: Chapter 10, Customer Validation, Phase 3: Product Development\nand Company Positioning\nMeetings arranged with key analysts, industry influencers\nTargets tracked and monitored since Customer Discovery\nAnalysts’ reports, press clippings, websites, etc., researched\nScript developed\nAnalyst presentation assembled\nMarket and product positioning\nProduct feature details\nReport card for gathering intelligence, tracking feedback\nExit criteria:\nDetailed feedback about the marketplace and product from key analysts\nand influencers\n\nCHAPTER 11\nCustomer Validation, Phase Four: The\nToughest Question of All: Pivot or Proceed?\nTHIS IS THE MOST CRITICAL, MOST GUT-WRENCHING phase of customer\nvalidation: honestly determining whether there’s a scalable, profitable\nbusiness model ahead. Is the company ready to go forward to the customer\ncreation step, when millions of dollars are often spent to fuel rapid customer\ngrowth? This step literally “calls the question” about the company’s future\ndirections. It’s time to study all the test results, all the customer learning and\nall the insights you’ve had from the facts you’ve gathered. Its time to see if\nthe company is ready to start spending money to scale, and that the result will\nbe a great, profitable company.\nThere are three steps to answering the crucial “pivot or proceed” question:\nAssemble and review all key discovery and validation findings\nReview the business model hypotheses and their interactions with one\nanother\nFocus on the “metrics that matter” in the financial model\nPivot or Proceed: Assemble Data Findings\nBy this point, the team has assembled a massive amount of hard data:\nindustry research, customer segments, customer feedback, marketing\nprogram results, channel and cost input and much more. The data needs to be\nverified, with any gaps, discrepancies, or anomalies filled in along the way. A\nfew examples:\nThe company needs 10,000 customers in order to be profitable, but the\nmarket isn’t that large\nCustomer acquisition or channel costs are too high, rendering the\ncompany unprofitable\nThe sales roadmap is too long and complex, making the cost of sales\nway too high\nDespite best efforts, referrals just aren’t delivering additional customers\nThese anomalies are relatively easy to spot when all the data is collected\nin one room. They often call for further customer, channel, or product\ndevelopment discussions. At times, they drive a business model pivot.\nThe best way to “translate” piles of data, is to make\nit as visual as possible.\nBuild a War Room\nThe best way to “translate” piles of data, reports and questionnaires is to\nmake it as visual as possible. For best results, lock the founding team in a\nroom for a day or two to walk step by step through each hypothesis. Cover\none wall with a blown up “final” business model canvas. Cover the other wall\nwith the hypotheses themselves, sorted to keep the pieces of each hypothesis\ntogether (remember, many hypotheses have multiple parts). Use another wall\nfor supporting diagrams, and allow space for the most recent canvas and\nperhaps one or two earlier iterations. Leave a large whiteboard available for\nkeeping score of questions and changes and for the key “metrics that matter”\nnumbers that emerge (discussed in detail in Step 3). While not every diagram\nis appropriate for your startup, review:\na work-flow map of the prototypical customer that diagrams how\ncustomers do their jobs or live their lives both with and without the new\nproduct\nan organizational/influence map showing whom consumers or\nbusinesspeople interact with, how often, and how those people influence\nbuying decisions.\ncustomer archetypes: how they earn and spend their money and use their\ntime\na market map showing where your customers will come from\na channel or sales roadmap diagramming how sales will happen\na fully updated business model canvas (along with a few earlier\nversions)\nReview the Data\nThe most important hard data to review includes:\ncustomer feedback, particularly from sales report cards evaluating\ncustomer enthusiasm for the product and its potential sales revenue over\ntime\nmarket size and market share estimates\nchannel feedback and revenue potential summaries\npricing, customer acquisition costs, and any major product cost changes\ndetailed information about the industry, the customers, and their\nbehavior\ncompetitive product and pricing information\nThe team, often including investors, should review all the materials to\nensure that all the learning from discovery and validation has been integrated\ninto the latest versions of the hypothesis documents and into an updated\nversion of the business model canvas that will be discussed in the next step.\nThe key activity at this stage is to look at the intersections of, or interactions\namong, the business model components, since no doubt many components\nhave changed along the way. The process is a healthy one, and the results\nfuel the next steps of the pivot-or-proceed process.\nLook at the intersections of, or interactions among\nthe business model components.\nThe Business Model Checklist (Figure 11.2) gives you and your\nmanagement team the questions you should be asking and worrying about.\nPrint them out. Keep them handy. And worry “Am I going to bet my\ncompany that I got them right?”\nChecklist 41: Assemble Data\nGoal: Assemble all data, reports, questionnaires, map, diagrams, etc., for full\nreview\nReference: Chapter 11, Customer Validation, Phase 4: The Toughest\nQuestion of All: Pivot or Proceed?\nWorkflow map of the prototypical customer\nAn organizational/influence map\nCustomer archetypes\nFully updated business model diagram (plus a few prior versions)\nCustomer feedback from sales report cards\nMarket size and market share estimates\nChannel feedback and revenue potential summaries\nPricing, customer acquisition costs, and any major product cost changes\nDetailed information about the industry, customers and their behavior\nCompetitive product and pricing information\nExit criteria:\nAll key feedback, hard data, diagrams and the most recent business\nmodel canvas assembled for review\nLearning from Discovery and Validation incorporated into latest\nversions of the hypotheses documents and updated Business Model\nCanvas\nIntersections of/interactions among business model components\nreviewed\nPass/Fail tests identified\nPivot or Proceed: Validate Your Business Model\nIt’s been a long road but you’ve converted most of your business model\nhypotheses from customer discovery into facts. You’ve done so by extensive\ntesting through face-to-face customer interactions. So, if the customerrelationships hypothesis said one of every five acquired customers will\nactivate and pay for the service or app, this actually happened in validation,\nwith hundreds if not thousands of customers. Or you’ve proven that people\nreturn to the product or app three times a week for an average of 20 minutes\nper visit or spend $100 a month visiting once.\nReview Business Model Hypotheses (Figure 11.1)\nThe team should assemble data collected in the last phase in its “war\nroom” use the checklist to walk through the business model hypotheses, box\nby box, and ascertain that there are factual, definitive answers to at least\nevery question on the checklist.\nIn this final phase of customer validation the company asks itself the\nsame questions it asked in Phase 4 of customer discovery. But at this point, it\nshould have much more quantitative, irrefutable proof of the answers, since\nyou’ve spoken to far more customers and conducted many more tests.\nThe Business Model Canvas as a Scorecard\nHopefully you’ve been taking regular snapshots of your business model\ncanvas – either week-by-week snapshots, or at least at each major pivot. If\nyou’ve done it this way you now essentially have a film strip of the\nentrepreneurial process.\nAs you can see from Figure 11.1, each stage of discovery and validation\nrefined the canvas. Experiments were run, learning caused iterations and a\nfew pivots, and all were documented in a new canvas (reread this section for\ntips).\nNow that you have your canvases up on the wall use them as a point of\ndiscussion.\nThe answers to “Is this a business?” can be found in\nthe results of the multitude of tests you’ve\nconducted throughout the validation process.\nThe answers to “Is this a business?” can be found in the results of the\nmultitude of tests you’ve conducted throughout the validation process. As is\noften the case, when the results aren’t convincing enough, or when they don’t\ndeliver the traffic or financial targets of the business model, it’s time to iterate\nor pivot, and retest to see if the new approach improves the results. After all,\nthe company will very shortly be spending millions of dollars in the customer\ncreation phase, where results are expected to be far more predictable, and\nmuch more is at risk. While this may seem ambitious and unreasonable, the\ncloser a company is to this “fact-based plan,” the greater its chances for\nbusiness and fund-raising success.\n\nBusiness Model Checklist (Figure 11.2)\nChecklist 42: Validate Business Model\nGoal: Use facts gathered to validate the business model\nReference: Chapter 11, Customer Validation, Phase 4: The Toughest\nQuestion of All: Pivot or Proceed?\nBusiness Model Checklist\nValue Proposition\nCustomer Segments\nValue Proposition 2: Market Type\nChannels\nCustomer Relationships\nCost Structure\nRevenue Stream\nExit criteria:\nEnsure all business model hypotheses have been converted into facts\nPass/Fail tests identified\nPivot or Proceed: Validate the Financial Model\nThis step answers one key question: do all the tests point to a scalable, sizable\nbusiness? And can it happen before the company runs out of money?\nIn this step, you’ll figure out whether you have a potentially thriving\nbusiness, a hobby, or a tax loss.\nAnswering the question doesn’t require pounds of Excel spreadsheets or\n50-item budgets. It relies more on the facts you’ve developed by testing your\noriginal hypotheses with the only people who have the answers, your\ncustomers, and with a short list of numbers, the metrics that matter.\nA mere handful of numbers define the difference\nbetween a scalable, profitable business and a\nfailure.\nA mere handful of numbers define the difference between a scalable,\nprofitable business and a failure. Successful entrepreneurs will be able to\nrecite, adjust, and recompute this handful or so of key numbers about\ncustomers, product costs, and revenue growth while they sleep. Meanwhile,\nthey’re always focused on the two metrics that matter most: how many\nmonths’ worth of cash remain in the bank? And how fast are we burning\nthrough what’s left?\nWe guarantee that this different approach to finance will get you thrown\nout of just about every business school in the country, but it’s all that’s\nneeded at this stage to determine whether your business model passes the\nvalidation test and is ready to move on from validation to scale in customer\ncreation.\nMetrics that Matter\nSince page 1 of this book you’ve been using the business model canvas to\norganize your testing. In this section we’re going to use the canvas to\norganize your financial model. This is a radically different approach\ncompared to more typical use of 5-year revenue forecast spreadsheets. Think\nof it as bringing your “report card” home to Mom and Dad—hopefully, a\nreport card full of A’s and A+’s, since B and C responses do not a great\ncompany make. Some elements of the business model represent revenue or\ncosts, while others fuel growth. Physical and web/mobile channel costs vary\nwidely, as do rates of sale and growth, so one last time we’ll examine the\nmetrics three different ways:\nIn a physical channel, less than a dozen numbers usually tell the entire story:\nValue proposition: What are product cost, market size, attainable market\nshare, and customer impact of network effects?\nCustomer Relationships: What are customer acquisition costs, prospect\nconversion rates, customer lifetime value, and customer switching costs\nthat the company may have to pay?\nMarket Type: As discussed in Chapter 1, different market types drive\ndifferent revenue curves to consider in longer-term revenue predictions\nCost Structure: What are the basic operating costs of the business?\nChannel: What are the costs of selling through the channel? Channel\nmargin, promotion, shelf-space charges?\nRevenue Streams: What are the average selling price, total achievable\nrevenue, and number of customers a year?\nBurn Rate (derived from the above): How much cash is the company\n“burning” (spending) a month? When will the company run out of cash?\nThere’s no precise formula for what a burn rate should be, but since it’s\nthe issue over which boards most often fire their founders, the founders\nand investors must agree on what the burn rate should be and how many\nmore pivots the startup can afford in its search for the scalable,\nprofitable business model\nAssemble all your test results to provide a forecast for the coming year,\nwhich begins on Day One of Step 3 of Customer Development, the customer\ncreation process.\nWe doubt there have been many startups where the year-one financial\nresults of customer creation matched the “metrics that matter.” But any VC,\nuncle or rich neighbor is going to want to know why you think an investment\nin your startup will deliver startup-size returns. If at the end of this step the\nnumbers are ugly—yup, you guessed it—turn back to the beginning of\ndiscovery, or at least customer validation, and start revising and retesting\nyour hypotheses.\nThree things to consider before you dive into Metrics That Matter:\nUse the time frames that make the most sense for your startup.\nGenerally, the longer the physical-channel sales cycle (think enterprise\nsoftware), the longer the “space” between calculations should be. Here\nwe used a quarter-by-quarter forecast\nAn analysis like this can—and should—often stop the pivot–or-proceed\nprocess in its tracks if the computation forecasts that the company will\neither run out of money within the year or won’t be able to raise enough\nfunds to survive the first year of customer creation\nDon’t be in a hurry at this critical step. As an entrepreneur, if you take a\npile of money to move forward here and fail, it will at least cost you a\nsignificant portion of your founders’ equity, and it will often cost you\nyour job\nMetrics that Matter Scenarios\nMetrics matters are a radically new approach to startup math. They’re best\nillustrated by example. The spreadsheet scenario on the following pages\nillustrates how you can use “Metrics that Matter” to evaluate your business if\nyou are selling a physical product in a physical channel.\nMetrics that Matter: Example\n“EZ Gardener” in a Physical Channel\nLet’s take a look at Table 11.1 what the metrics that matter for a\nphysical channel would look like in spreadsheet form.\nHere’s a simple example of a rough quarter-by-quarter cash-burn\ncomputation for our hypothetical $30 (suggested retail) EZ Gardener all-inone gardening-tool set, sold in garden stores and by mass merchants. Our\ntiming is the coming year. (The spreadsheet starts Day One of the customer\ncreation process.)\n“Metrics That Matter”: Physical Channel Model (Table 11.1)\nNote: the leftmost numbers refer to commentary in descriptive text that\nfollows.\nA few things about the hypothetical business factored into the numbers\nabove:\nThis “friends and family” funded venture begins customer creation with\n$500,000 in the bank. Like most physical-channel marketers, EZ\nGardener also promotes online. But they read this book, followed\ndirections, and are “getting the most important channel right first,” so\nthey’re not selling product online yet\nIn year two, as the product’s newness wears off, the price drops.\nProduct development was completed earlier offshore, so there are no\nmore development costs until we see how this product sells\nRevenue never scales dramatically, since the market type is “resegmenting/niche market”\nWhat Metrics Matter?\nThere are 11 metrics that matter in this spreadsheet. Following the left-hand\ncolumn of the spreadsheet, let’s explore the origin of each number as well as\nits source a little more closely:\n1. Total number of units sold: This number is estimated (ideally by\nquarter) from customer validation report cards used with buyers and\nchannel partners. Compare these numbers with your estimates of total\naddressable (or if known, serviceable) market and your market share\nestimates. Use the two sets of numbers to estimate the number of units to\nbe sold in each quarter. If customers make multiple purchases within a\nyear, factor it in.\n2. Average retail selling price: How much the consumer will pay, on\naverage, for the product. This number, developed in the value proposition\nhypothesis, should be validated in the competitive analysis and\nthroughout customer and channel validation conversations. It’s shown\nhere as the price per unit and is often the average selling price, since retail\npricing may vary by channel.\n3. Gross sales across all channels: Total retail-dollar sales for the product\nper quarter. Relatively straightforward to compute, since the company is\nusing only one sales channel. Remember to consider “guaranteed sale”\nsituations where retailers can return unsold merchandise for full credit.\n4. (Less) channel discount (40%): What percentage of the product’s retail\nprice will the channel take as its cost of sales? Deduct it from the retail\nprice and apply it to all channel revenue as computed in No. 3. We’ve\nassumed a fairly typical chain-store margin here. This revenue will never\nreach the company’s coffers, so deduct it now to get to net company\nrevenue.\nChannels are notorious for charging suppliers for\nadvertising, promotion, and shelf space.\n5. (Less) other channel costs: Channels are notorious for charging\nsuppliers for advertising, promotion, and even shelf space. There may\nalso be costs of independent sales reps or brokers who “sell in”\nmerchandise to the channel. In the first year, the company may want to,\nor be forced to, purchase special promotions in order to get shelf space in\nan important retail channel. Estimate these costs based on channel-partner\ndiscussions.\n6. NET COMPANY REVENUE: The net channel revenue (No. 6) is the\nGross Sales (No. 3) minus the channel discount (No. 4) and other channel\ncost (No.5).\n7. (Less) sales costs (reps, trade shows): How much does it cost the team\nto reach the garden product channel cost? In addition to specific customer\nacquisition costs, the company will spend money on a sales force, sales\nand marketing materials, attendance at trade shows and more. These costs\nshould be identified in the customer-relationships box and perhaps also in\nthe cost structure box.\n8. (Less) product costs: What does it cost to build and make the product?\nDeveloped primarily from the value proposition and cost structure boxes,\nthis is an estimate combining two sets of costs:\n• in this example the cost of developing the product is fully paid for\n• the manufacturing cost of the physical product itself\n9. (Less) current operating costs: Compute the costs of “turning on the\nlights” at the company every day, which should be a relatively static\nnumber: meager founder salaries, other payroll, rent, equipment, utilities,\nlegal, and the like. This number usually shifts the least, so worry about it\nless than others. The spreadsheet increases it modestly late in the year and\nin the second year, as is typical.\n10. CASH BURN FOR PERIOD: Did we make or lose money this quarter?\nHow much? Start with the net company revenue (No. 6) and subtract all\nthe costs beneath it, Nos. 7, 8, and 9. The result of that equation is the\n“cash burn,” or the reduction in the company’s bank account each quarter.\nIn the example above, the company is losing money, or “burning cash,”\nuntil the fourth quarter, when customer growth and reduced productdevelopment costs improve the company’s cash flow quite dramatically.\n11. CASH REMAINING: Start by counting the money in the bank on Day\nOne of the quarter. Our hypothetical company began its first year of\ncustomer creation with $500,000 in the bank. Reduce it by the quarter’s\ncash burn to determine how much will be left at quarter’s end.\nIf These Were Your Numbers, What’s a Founder to\nDo?\nThis is a “nice little business,” and while it will make a lovely living for its\nfounders and a nice return for its investors, it’s hardly a scalable business like\nthe many heroes of Silicon Valley. But even though this company is returning\nas much pretax profit in year two as it had in the bank on day one of year one,\nit’s basically going nowhere fast. It’s a one-product company, and the only\nway it got strong revenue growth was by reducing its retail price—never a\ngood sign.\nSome things the founders and board should really be discussing:\nAre there any potential dramatic changes to the business model that can\nhave significant impact on the company’s future growth prospects?\nWhat about overseas markets? Are they a growth opportunity?\nHow can the company capitalize on its one modest success. Are they\nbuilding a brand enough, and creative enough, to perhaps launch other\nproducts both in and beyond the garden area. They might start with\n“EZWeeder” and “EZhoe” first, and perhaps expand to “EZgrass” or\n“EZflowers” to take maximum advantage of their brand, credibility and\nchannel relationships to scale the company broader and faster?\nCan they extend beyond the garden, maybe adding “EZcooker” or\n“EZcleaner” or “EZcleanup” perhaps? Regardless of the new products,\nthe company would need to spend some serious product development\ndollars and spend heavily on marketing (especially if moving beyond the\ngarden) with no assurances of further success. (They actually need to\ndevelop a whole new set of hypotheses)\nUnless the company invests in new product development, this business\nis more of a hobby than a scalable business\nHold these thoughts—and others—for the final section of this phase, the\npivot-or-proceed discussion. Next, look at the second of three business\nmodels for a software product sold in the web and mobile channels.\nSome Final Thoughts About the Financial Model\nMarket Type Affects Revenue Streams. Each of the four market types has a\ndistinctive sales-growth curve shaped by the degree of difficulty involved in\ntransitioning from sales to the earlyvangelists to sales to mainstream\ncustomers. Obviously in new markets, it typically takes considerable time for\nthe product to catch on beyond earlyvangelists, who aren’t typically highvolume mainstream buyers. So success with early sales doesn’t guarantee fast\nrevenue scaling.\nThe sales-growth curves for a new market and an existing market\ngraphically illustrate the difference. Even after finding and successfully\nselling to earlyvangelists, the rate of sales differs in later years because of the\ndifferent adoption rates of mainstream customers.\nRevenue Growth in New and Existing Markets (Figure 11.3)\nEstimating revenue in an existing market is relatively simple: Look at\nthe incumbents and calculate the increasing percentage of market share the\nstartup will grab each year.\nEstimating a new market’s size might seem impossible, since it doesn’t\nexist yet. What to do? Estimate the opportunity based on proxies and adjacent\nmarkets. See if there are any comparable companies. Have others grown as\nfast as the estimate? Why will this startup perform similarly?\nRevenue Growth in a Resegmented Market (Figure 11.4)\nThe sales curve in a re-segmented market is somewhat easier to\nestimate. It’s generally similar to that of a new market in that it takes time to\ngather a head of steam. There are three steps to assessing a re-segmented\nmarket: assess the size of the existing market, figure out how large your\nstartup’s “segment” is, and calculate the adoption rate, or the time it will take\nfor that segment to recognize the new product as the solution of choice.\nCount only the segment that will switch, and beware of long-term contracts,\nservice contracts, and “sunk costs” such as training and installation, all of\nwhich are often “lock-ins” or hidden barriers to switching.\nRevenue growth curves depend on Market Type!\nDemand Curve Affects Revenue: The “demand curve” seeks the optimum\nintersection between sales volume and net profit. For example, if a physical\nproduct is most efficiently manufactured in lot sizes of 5,000, can that\ninventory be sold in a reasonable time when current unit sales are 50 a\nmonth? A startup selling new electric cars for $29,000 will generate massive\ndemand. But if they cost $45,000 to manufacture, the company will go\nbankrupt very quickly. Consider:\nthe actual price per unit, for multiples, and for subscriptions\nhow pricing can be used to attract more users\nhow pricing can create larger or more frequent purchases by the same\nuser; volume discounts, free shipping, loyalty points and similar pricing\nmechanisms are used for what’s typically called “market basket”\noptimization\nhow pricing can be used to enhance profitability or volume\nhow the company can forward-price the product to intersect the\neconomies-of-scale curve (as in, “If we could build 10,000 at a time, our\nproduction cost drops 32 percent”)\nWhen to Bring in the Accountants\nEventually, prospective investors, banks, and others will want to see the\ntraditional P&L, forecast, and more, and that’s fine. Once the metrics that\nmatter are firmly understood to make sound business sense and are validated,\nalmost any finance type (or high school math student) can convert them into a\nVC-ready multiyear P&L spreadsheet, balance sheet, and cash-flow statement\n(the “usual stuff” everyone is accustomed to seeing) with ease.\nOn rare and welcome occasions, metrics that matter actually don’t\nmatter at all. If customer acquisition and activation are proceeding at warp\nspeed month after month or the economy is hot, investors may ignore most of\nthe other metrics, throw caution to the wind, and vote to scale the company\nrapidly. This seldom happens, but we hope it happens to you. It can happen\nmore often in frothy vertical markets, as it did in social networking and other\nmulti-sided markets or strong IPO markets,. But nine times out of 10, the\nmetrics that matter do matter quite a bit when it comes time to spend serious\ninvestor dollars.\nAdding it all up\nThis phase is a vital make-or-break analysis of how well the business model\nshould work. But remember that the numbers are still only educated guesses,\nvalidated—we hope—through extensive customer discovery and validation\neffort with scores if not hundreds of customers.\nChecklist 43: Validate Financial Model\nGoal: Ensure the startup can become a profitable, scalable business before it\nruns out of money\nReference: Chapter 11, Customer Validation, Phase 4: The Toughest\nQuestion of All: Pivot or Proceed?\nValue Proposition\nProduct cost\nMarket size\nAttainable market share\nCustomer impact of network effects\nCustomer Relationships\nCustomer acquisition costs\nProspect conversion rates\nCustomer Lifetime Value\nCustomer switching costs\nMarket Type considerations\nBasic operating costs\nChannel costs\nChannel margin, promotion and shelf space fees\nRevenue streams\nAverage selling price\nTotal achievable revenue\nNumber of customers/year\nCash balance\nDo the Math\nExit criteria:\nA full financial picture of the company’s ability to succeed\nPass/Fail tests identified\nPivot or Proceed: Re-Validate the Business Model\nIt’s the perfect time to take one last look at the key business model\ncomponents, for several reasons. In a few days, a great deal will change if the\nvote is “go forward” to the customer creation step. Customer creation is a\nradically different stage during which the company suddenly shifts from\n“searching for a business model” to “executing one.” It’s no longer\ncelebrating mistakes and wrong turns. It shifts full-throttle into “execute”\nmode, with revenue targets and timetables to hit, product and plans to deliver,\nand more granular and precise accountability to investors and board\nmembers.\nThe company is about to spend a great deal of money far faster, and\nirrevocably, as it works ambitiously to deliver its chosen business model.\nWith that comes the typical “career risk” for founders, which always prompts\ninvestors to ask if the seemingly manic “founder type” should be replaced by\na “seasoned” leader with proven execution skills. Massive amounts of money\nare about to be spent on a single, focused bet that the business model, as\ndeveloped, has a high likelihood of scaling to profit and success. Boards and\ninvestors are suddenly less forgiving and typically far less welcoming of\nreports like “That idea was wrong” and “That didn’t work as we hoped” than\nthey were during the earlier “search” phases.\nLong story short, it’s time to revisit the core business model elements\none last time.\nBest Bets\nYou’re almost done. You’ve run the numbers in the last section and are still\nfeeling like your business is a winner. But have you picked the best value\nproposition? Is your product delivery schedule right? Are you confident\nyou’ve gotten the optimum revenue model and costs? And have you missed\nany best moves on the overall business model? Here are a few last things to\ncheck.\nMake Sure the Value Proposition is Right\nAfter going through the “metrics that matter” in the last section, are you\nabsolutely convinced you have the right value proposition? You’re about to\nlive with it for awhile. If you don’t feel that it’s going to win the marketplace\nnow, it doesn’t get better over time. It may be time to reconfigure, repackage\nor unbundle the product. This requires a loop all the way back to customer\ndiscovery. Once there, use the core technology to develop another product,\nconfiguration, distribution method or price and then modify product\npresentations and return to Phase 3 (product presentation) and do it again.\nYes, it hurts, but it hurts far less than failure.\nMake Sure the Product Delivery is Right\nEven with selling success, check the product delivery timing with the\nproduct-development team. Schedules inevitably change, seldom for the\nbetter. Can the company still deliver what was just sold and do so as\npromised, or was the sale actually vaporware? If vaporware, at best the\ncompany secured a few pilot projects. Continuing to sell as if nothing has\nchanged is a bad idea. As schedules slip, hard-won earlyvangelists weaken,\nand references evaporate quickly. The good news is, if this happens (it\nhappens often), the situation is still recoverable. There aren’t many people to\nfire, and the burn rate is low. (As discussed earlier, it’s always important to\nhave enough cash to get this phase wrong at least once.) The solution is to\nshut down any additional selling for a while, admit mistakes, and turn pilot\nprojects into something useful—first for the customer and then as a\nmarketable product.\nMake Sure the Revenue is High and Costs are Low\nThere’s nothing worse than leaving money on the table or spending more\nthan you needed to. The best way to answer these questions and more is to\n“walk” slowly through the business model one more time.\nStart with the value proposition. Are there too many features or not\nenough variety? Would a lower price sell far more units or sell the same\nnumber at a lower acquisition cost? What if the product were free, or\nfree to those bringing three or five or 10 other customers along?\nIn the customer-relationships hypothesis, is there rock-solid confidence\nin the plan, or might a freemium or multi-sided alternative deliver\nbolder, faster growth? Will that costly AdWords effort deliver the\nplanned result?\nCan a different channel deliver fewer sales and more profit?\nWill partners deliver the revenue growth you need and expect?\nAre there higher level business model patterns you may have missed?\nMake Sure Your Business Model is Right\nGrab a fresh business model canvas and a pack of Post-it notes. Explore\nalternatives seriously. The team is about to put a big pile of chips, probably\nmillions, on “red” or “black,” as in “pass” or “fail.” Is everyone confident the\nchoice is the right?\nChanging direction at this juncture is a bold move indeed. It’s not what\nthe investors expected, especially after a long, grueling process of customer\ndiscovery and validation. Then again, bold moves are the work of great\nentrepreneurs. And even though a pivot at this point leads to more customer\nvalidation and more time, it’s far better to pivot now than to forge ahead at\nfull speed and full spend if it’s possible that there’s a better idea out there\nsomewhere.\nFurther validate the business model, not just looking for enhancements\nin revenue opportunity and places to reduce cost, but looking for “game\nchangers.” Can you change a product sold by features into a brandedexperience that becomes a “got-to-have-it” fashion? Can you change a\nrevenue model from a unit sale into a network effects model? Look for the\nnon-obvious business patterns. Even if the team is certain the current model\nis the best way forward, now’s the time to bring in your advisory board and\nhave them throw stones (painful as it is) at your canvas. Do they see a huge\nmove that you missed? No doubt the financial model review just completed\nraised at least a handful of questions and perhaps pointed to some\nopportunities. Revisit the business model checklist questions. Are any of the\nanswers different? Does the team want to have more money in the bank or\nspend less? Where can savings be effected or additional dollars efficiently put\nto good?\nIf the team has turned over every possibility in its review, looking both\nat radical changes and modest improvements in the business model, and\nconfidence still carries the day, it’s time to move on to the ultimate question:\npivot or proceed?\nChecklist 44: Re-Validate The Business Model\nGoal: Further validate the business model\nReference: Chapter 11, Customer Validation, Phase 4: The Toughest\nQuestion of All: Pivot or Proceed? Revalidate the Financial Model\nBusiness Model Canvas revisited\nBusiness Model Checklist revisited\nValue Proposition\nCustomer Segments\nValue Proposition 2: Market Type\nChannels\nCustomer Relationships\nCost Structure\nRevenue Stream\nExit criteria:\nDetermine if the company is making the best bet possible\nAssess if revenue is as high and costs as low as they can realistically be\nPass/Fail tests identified\nThe Toughest Startup Question: Pivot or Proceed?\nThis is the moment of truth when the team and the investors will vote on\nwhether to begin spending massive amounts of money to execute the business\nmodel. To vote honestly, the team needs to take a hard, honest look at the\npivot-or-proceed analyses developed in this phase.\nAs grueling as the customer validation process is, it’s quite likely that\nthe company will require another turn of the wheel before everyone can\nenthusiastically vote to move forward. Don’t despair—this need to pivot\narises almost every time, and often calls for a return all the way to customer\ndiscovery.\nHubris is the evil twin of a passionate entrepreneur.\nThe alternative is even more painful. In the past, investors magically\nassumed flawless execution and fired executives who failed. It’s time to\nreflect, thinking seriously about the company’s genuine chances for scalable,\nprofitable success. It’s a hard decision, particularly for self-confident\nentrepreneurs who pride themselves on their tenacity, and problem-solving\nabilities. “I’m an entrepreneur. I make things happen against all odds” just\ndoesn’t cut it when staring at the hard facts and statistics. Don’t confuse\nhubris with passion or facts.\nDid validation really convert opinions to facts, or is everyone just\nmoving the goalposts to reach customer creation? The next step seriously\ncranks up the company’s cash burn rate, sharply diminishing if not\nextinguishing available cash or runway.\nDid the product sell well and easily? Is it absolutely, unequivocally clear\nthat when more money is spent to acquire customers, they’ll arrive at a\nsteady, predictable, profitable pace? This question in particular probably\nsends 90 percent of startups back into the depths of Customer Development\nto refine and retest components of the business model.\nIf the “ramp” to more customers, revenue and profits isn’t proved to be\npredictable in test results, it’s also a reason to pivot. Using everything you\nlearned in customer validation, go back to Phase 1 of this step (get ready to\nsell) and try it again. Sorry. This isn’t easy to do.\nIf everything checks out (again, it seldom does the first time around), the\nend of customer validation is a major milestone. Customer problems are\nunderstood, a set of earlyvangelists has been found, and the company has\ndelivered a product its customers want to buy, developed a repeatable and\nscalable sales process, and demonstrated a profitable business model.\nHopefully, all the learning is captured in writing and the business model\ndiagram is updated. Fund-raising, while never easy, will be far easier than at\nthis point than it was before.\nWhen you’ve answered “yes” to that taxing list of questions, you\ndeserve a night off, if not a week. Congratulations! The company is prepared\nto move full speed ahead to the customer creation process.\nChecklist 45: Pivot or Proceed?\nGoal: Decide whether to execute the business model\nReference: Chapter 11,

produces the best results.\nAcquisition is the first step in the web/mobile “get/keep/grow” sales funnel.\nIt gets people to visit your website, where you can then activate them by\ngetting them to engage, purchase, or at least register for future sales efforts.\nSpecific customer acquisition categories include earned and paid media, and\ntactics include search (SEM/SEO), e-mail, PR/blogs, viral, social nets.\nActivation is the second step in the web/mobile “get/keep/grow” sales\nfunnel. After you acquire customers you get them to register, participate or\npurchase on the website. Specific customer activation tactics include free\ntrials, home/landing page.\nAgile Development is the engineering method used to develop products\n(hardware, software or services) iteratively and incrementally with flexibility\nto react to customer feedback. It recognizes that customer needs and the final\nproduct spec cannot be fully defined a priori. Agile is the antithesis of\nWaterfall Development.\nARPU, or Average Revenue Per User, is a measurement of revenue typically\napplied by subscription services like cellphone or data plans to measure\naverage long-term spending.\nAwareness. In the physical channel, it is the first step in the “get customers”\nsales funnel. Tactics include earned media (pr, blogs, brochures, reviews),\npaid media (ads, promotions), online tools\nBusiness Model is the description of how an organization creates, delivers\nand captures value. In this book it specifically refers to Alexander\nOsterwalder’s 9-box Business Model Canvas.\nBusiness Plan is a document written by existing companies to describe and\nlaunch follow-on or adjacent market products. It was mistakenly used for\nstartups for decades until it was realized that no business plan survives first\ncontact with customers. Typically has sections labeled: opportunity, industry\nbackground, competitive analysis, marketing plan, operations plan,\nmanagement summary and financial plan.\nCanvas refers to Alexander Osterwalder’s 9-box Business Model Canvas. In\nthis book we use the canvas to capture our business model hypotheses and as\na scorecard over time.\nChannel is the sales and/or distribution channel. How the product gets from\nyour company to the customer. This book talks about “physical channels”\nand “web/mobile channels.”\nChannel Stuffing fills your sales channel with more product than the channel\nhas end-user demand for. Used as an often-illegal tactic to inflate company\nrevenue (when revenue is recognized as shipped to the channel, rather than\nshipped from the channel to the end customer).\nChurn (sometimes called Attrition) is the number of customers or\nsubscribers who leave a service in a period of time. Usually measured in\nmonthly percentages. If 1 of 10 customers leave, the churn rate is 10%.\nCohort analysis is the measurement of a specific unchanging group of\ncustomers over time.\nCollateral materials are the brochures, data sheets, white papers, sell sheets\nand other literature companies generally in physical channels develop to\nmarket their products or services.\nConsideration The third step in the physical purchase decision cycle or\n“sales funnel.” The sales funnel includes awareness, interest, consideration\nand purchase.\nCompany Building is the fourth of four steps in the Customer Development\nprocess. Founders reorganize the company from one focused on searching for\na business model into building an organization that can execute.\nCPA (cost per acquisition) The price web businesses pay to purchase\nreferrals or customers from partners or other web businesses.\nCPM (cost per thousand) is an advertising industry measure for purchasing\nmedia, whether it be magazine ad space or banners on websites. Ad pricing is\nbased on CPM. A magazine selling 6,000,000 copies has 6,000 “M’s” to sell.\nCross-Sell is a tactic to grow existing customers by encouraging them to buy\ncomplementary products, increasing their average order size. “Buy this other\nbook and get 10% off.” Or “buy this suitcase and add the toiletry kit.” See\nUp-Sell.\nCustomer Archetypes are detailed descriptions of customer traits, including\nhard (demographics, psychographics, etc.) and soft (interviews, anecdotal\nmaterial) customer data to form a descriptive profile and an entire story\nabout a typical type or group of the company’s customer(s). (Most startups\ntypically have more than one archetypical customer.) Archetypes are used by\nboth product and customer development to better focus on the target\ncustomer.\nCustomer Development first described in the Four Steps to the Epiphany, is\nthe four-step process to organize the search for a repeatable and scalable\nbusiness model. Executed by the Customer Development Team.\nCustomer Development Team replaces the traditional Sales, Marketing and\nBusiness Development in the discovery and validation steps of startups. The\nteam is responsible for validating the business model hypotheses in front of\ncustomers. The team must have at least one founder with the authority to\nchange the company’s strategy.\nCustomer Discovery is the first of the four steps of Customer Development.\nIn Discovery, founders articulate their hypotheses about the business model\nand then run experiments to test problem and solution in front of customers.\nCustomer Relationships are the strategies used by companies to get\ncustomers into its sales channel, keep them as customers, and over time grow\ntheir value to the company through additional revenue and customer referrals\nfrom them.\nCustomer Segment defines a single subset of a startup’s customer universe\nand how they differ from others, as in “50+ golfers who play more than twice\na month,” often including the a problems/needs they have. Companies define\nspecific value propositions for each segment.\nCustomer Validation is the second of the four steps of Customer\nDevelopment. In validation, founders take their tested hypotheses and try to\nget initial orders/users/ customers.\nCustomer Creation is the third of four Customer Development steps. In\ncreation, once founders validate their business model, they expand sales and\nmarketing activities to grow.\nData Chief is the senior executive at mobile/web companies who monitors\nand continually optimizes the results of customer acquisition, activation and\nretention efforts. Sometimes known as the CMO, VP-Marketing or database\nmarketer.\nDemand Creation is the specific set of acquisition activities to drive\ncustomers into a startup’s chosen sales channel(s). It’s the “get” customers\nportion of the “Get/Keep/Grow” process of creating Customer Relationships.\nEarlyvangelist is a concatenation of “early adopter” and “evangelist.” In a\nstartup earlyvangelists are the company’s first customers, who buy the\nproduct very early because it solves a problem or fills an urgent need for\nthem.\nEarned Media is the free exposure a company generates. It includes a wide\nrange of exposure tools including SEO or natural search, press releases,\nproduct reviews, editorial features. Earned media are part of a company’s\n“Get customers” programs.\n“Executing” a Business Model is what companies do after they have found\na repeatable and scalable business model. It is how companies grow revenue\nonce they have refined and proven their plan to do so. It requires significant\norganizational changes. See Search.\nExperiments are what startups conduct to test hypotheses. Experiments are\ndesigned as objective pass/fail tests. For example: “We believe we can\nacquire users with Google Adwords at a cost of 20 cents per click.”\nExternal Audit: is a survey of outsiders’ perception of the company and/or\nits product, gleaned from interviews with consumers.\nEye Tracking is a tool that tells you the path users’ eyes follow on a web\npage. Extremely useful for eliminating guess work in web page design. See\nheat maps.\nGet, Keep and Grow activities are the steps companies take to acquire,\nretain and grow their customers. Getting customers, sometimes called\ndemand creation, drives customers into a chosen sales channel(s); Keeping\ncustomers, or retention, gives customers reasons to stick with the company\nand product; and Growing customers involves selling them more and\nencouraging them to refer new customers.\n“Get out of the building” is a key tenet of Customer Development. It\nobserves that unlike an existing company, in a startup there are no facts\ninside the building, so founders need to get outside to talk to customers. It’s\nthe customers who can turn the startup’s many guesses about its business\nmodel into facts.\nHeat Maps are tools that tell you where users’ eyes focus first, second and\nthird on a web page page. It is based on eye tracking, which literally observes\nwhere users’ eyes go on a web page.\nHigh-fidelity MVP is the simplest minimum viable product (i.e. a website\nwith the core features implemented, a demo of the physical product) and is\noften quite rudimentary or “rough and dirty.” It is used to gather feedback\nabout the validity of the customer solution. See low-fidelity MVP.\nHome Page (sometimes called the “landing” page) is the initial or principal\nweb page of a company’s product or website. See landing page and splash\npage.\nHypotheses are the educated guesses a startup’s founders have about their\nBusiness Model Hypotheses. Hypotheses are drawn on the Business Model\nCanvas, and tested and refined throughout the Customer Development\nprocess.\nInternal Audit is a survey of what employees understand, perceive, or\nbelieve about the company, and its product, and their positioning. See\nexternal audit.\nIteration is a minor change to one or more of the nine boxes of the business\nmodel canvas. (For example, a pricing change from $39.99 to $79.99 or\ncustomer segment from boys 12-15 years old to boys 15-19.) See Pivot.\nInterest. In the physical channel, Interest is one of four steps in the “get\ncustomers” sales funnel. See awareness.\nLanding Page (sometimes called the “splash” page) is the web page that\nappears when a customer clicks on a link, ad, or e-mail. It can sometimes be a\ncompany’s home page. The landing page displays sales copy that is\nconnected to the ad or link. See home page.\nLean Startup is a combination of Customer Development and Agile\nDevelopment popularized by Eric Ries.\nLocal/Global Maximum are the results of hypotheses tests, that may show a\nshort-term low-level response (the local maximum). This contrasts with the\nglobal maximum – the best possible test result, sometimes overlooked in\nshort-term market testing.\nLow-fidelity MVP is the simplest minimum viable product (i.e. a landing\npage with a sign-up to get more information, a cardboard mockup of a\nphysical product) used to gather feedback about the validity of the customer\nproblem. See High-fidelity MVP.\nLoyalty Programs are tactics such as “points” and “frequent shopper\nprograms” used to “keep” existing customers and reduce churn. See churn.\nLTV (LifeTime Value), usually calculated in dollars, reflects the total\nrevenue a customer is worth over the lifetime of his relationship with the\ncompany. (This book arbitrarily picks three years.) LTV helps calculate how\nmuch a company can afford to spend to acquire a customer.\nMarket Type refers to the four startup market entry strategies:\n1) entering an existing market with a higher performance product\n2) resegmenting an existing market (via a niche or low-cost strategy)\n3) creating a new market where one never existed before\n4) creating a clone market – copying a business model from another\ncountry\nMicrosites are small sub-websites within a larger site dedicated to a single\npurpose (like a retirement planning site with a big bank website) that are\noften used to attract customers’ attention from both within and outside the\nsite itself.\nMinimum Feature Set is another term used to describe Minimum Viable\nProduct.\nMinimum Viable Product (MVP) is the smallest group of features that will\nelicit customer feedback. Initially the MVP could be as simple as a\nPowerPoint slide, a video or demo. For web/mobile products it can be a lowor high-fidelity MVP that illustrates the “core” customer problem/need and\ndemonstrates the product’s solution.\nMulti-sided Business Models may have several different customer\nsegments. Each segment may have a different value proposition, revenue\nmodel and channel. For example, Google’s search business has users who\npay nothing to use its search site, and an advertiser or payer segment that uses\nits AdSense site and pays to reach the search users. Other business models,\nsuch as medical devices, may be even more complex and have four or more\n“sides” customer segments such as patients, doctors, insurers and hospitals.\nPaid Media is media exposure that’s purchased on TV, billboards, direct\nmail or the web. See earned media. Paid media are part of a company’s “Get\ncustomers” programs.\nPhysical Channel is a sales and fulfillment channel with physical points of\ndistribution and customer contact. Can include warehouses, retail stores,\ndirect sales people. See web/mobile channel.\nPhysical Product is a product made out of atoms. Cars, planes, computers,\nand food are physical products, but social networks and search engines are\nnot. See web/mobile products.\nPivot is a substantive change in one or more of the nine boxes of the business\nmodel canvas. (For example, a revenue model change from freemium to\nsubscription model or a customer segment shift from boys 12-15 years old to\nwomen 45-60.) See Iteration.\nPricing describes the tactics a startup uses to determine how much it will\ncharge in order to implement a profitable revenue model. (i.e. Freemium,\nSubscription, tiered or volume pricing, etc.)\nProblem/Need (Customer) is why customers buy. In some markets\ncustomers rationally recognize they have a problem and search for a product\nthat can solve it. (Think software, snow tires, catheters) In other markets\nproducts may be purchased for an emotionally perceived need. (Movies,\nfashion, video games, social networks.)\nProduct Development is the engineering group building the product. The\nprocess startup product development teams most often use to build the\nproduct is called Agile Development.\nReference Story is an introductory explanation used when first contacting a\nprospect via e-mail or phone. It emphasizes the problems you’re trying to\nsolve, why it’s important to solve them, the solution you’re building, and why\nit should be of interest to the prospect.\nRevenue Model describes the strategy of how a company will make money.\nIt answers the question, “Where will the revenue be coming from?” For\nexample, eBay makes a small fee on every transaction on its site, while\nNetflix charges a monthly subscription. Also see pricing.\nSales Closer is the individual on the Customer Development Team\nresponsible for “closing” (bringing in the order) initial earlyvangelist sales.\nThey deal with the sales logistics founders may not have experience with\n(negotiating with purchasing agents, contract terms, etc.) They are not sales\nmanagers, and likely not going to become the company’s VP of Sales.\nSales Funnel is a visual metaphor for tracking sales progress shaped like a\ndumbbell. Consists of “Get/Keep/Grow” activities. Wide at the top with raw\nleads coming in, the “Get” stage of the sales funnel narrows at each stage as\nthe leads get qualified and turn into suspects, then prospects, then probable\ncloses, until finally an order comes out of the narrow neck of the funnel. The\n“Keep” portion is narrow like a pipe, and the “Grow” part of the funnel\nwidens to represent ever increasing revenue from an existing customer base.\nSales Roadmap provides details of how to execute each step of the sales\nfunnel: who at a company to call on, in what order, to make a sale.\n“Search” for a Business Model is what startups do before they have found a\nrepeatable and scalable business model. Searching uses the Customer\nDevelopment process described in this book. See execution.\nSell-in is the first order a channel places for a new product. It can also be a\nseasonal order like the pre-Christmas sell-in.\nSell-through the volume of product sold by the channel to the ultimate\nconsumer. When products are “sold through,” they can seldom be returned to\nthe company. See channel stuffing.\nSplash page is an archaic term for landing or home page. See home page.\nSplit Testing see A/B testing.\nStartup is a temporary organization built to search for the answers to what\nmakes a repeatable and scalable business model.\nTake rate is the percentage of customers accepting (or taking) an up-sell/\nnext-sell offer.\nTraffic is the measure of how many individuals visit a store or website. They\ncan arrive from paid media (i.e. Google, TV, or Facebook ads) or earned\nmedia sources (public relations, referrals).\nUp-Sell is a tactic used to grow existing customers. It tries to get customers\nto buy more units or upgrade to a higher priced product to increase the\naverage order size. See Cross-Sell.\nValue Proposition describes the job being done for the customer. It includes\nfeatures that are solutions to customer problems or needs (productivity,\nstatus, simplicity, convenience, etc.) for the customer segment(s). A value\nproposition should match a startup’s customer segment.\nViral Loop is the process of satisfied customers referring others to a\nbusiness, whether web, mobile or physical. It produces exponential increases\nin customer/ users/traffic. See viral marketing.\nViral Marketing are the marketing activities used to stimulate customers to\nrefer others to the business.\nWaterfall Development is the engineering process used to develop products\n(hardware, software or services) linearly, sequentially, with a stage-by-stage\nmethod. The entire product and all features are specified up-front. Each\nwaterfall stage is assigned to a separate team to ensure greater project and\ndeadline control. Waterfall is the antithesis of Agile Development.\nWeb/Mobile Channel is a sales and fulfillment channel using the Internet to\ndeliver messages and products to desktop, laptop, and mobile devices. Can\ninclude websites, the cloud, phone app stores. See physical channel.\nWeb/Mobile Product is a product made out of bits: social networks, video\ngames, mobile applications are examples. See physical product.\nAcknowledgements\nI’VE LIVED THREE LIVES. MY FIRST CAREER STARTED in the Air Force during\nthe Vietnam War. Next, I spent over two decades as a Silicon Valley\ntechnology entrepreneur. Now I’m into my second decade as an educator.\nA few people changed my life at critical moments. In Thailand, John\nScoggins, my first boss, took me off a flight line full of fighter planes and\ngunships and gave me part of the electronic warfare shop to run when I was\n19. As an entrepreneur in my 20s and 30s, I was lucky to have four\nextraordinary mentors, each brilliant in his field: Ben Wegbreit, who taught\nme how to think; Gordon Bell, who taught me what to think about; Rob Van\nNaarden, who taught me how to think about customers; and Allen Michels,\nwho taught me how to turn thinking into direct, immediate and outrageous\naction.\nMy eight technology startups had me working with, around and near\nsome extraordinary people: Bill Perry, John Moussouris, John Hennessy,\nSkip Stritter, Jon Rubenstein, Glen Miranker, Cleve Moler, Tom McMurray,\nJohn Sanguinetti, Alvy Ray Smith, Chris Kryzan, Karen Dillon, Margaret\nHughes, Peter Barrett, Jim Wickett, Karen Richardson, Greg Walsh, John\nMcCaskey, and Roger Siboni. Some were active mentors, and others taught\nme by osmosis.\nSitting on startup boards, I watched world-class entrepreneurs at work:\nSteve Weinstein, Fred Amoroso, Fred Durham, Maheesh Jain, and Will\nHarvey. And I got to see how smart and thoughtful venture investors helped\ntheir companies solve problems: Kathryn Gould, Jon Feiber, Mike Maples,\nBill Davidow and many more. At General Electric, I watched Prescott Logan\nuse Customer Development to create a new Energy Storage division with the\nagility of a startup inside a 100-year old company.\nAs a board member of IMVU, Will Harvey and Eric Ries were the first\ncorporate guinea pigs to implement the Customer Development process with\nme. As the best student I ever had, Eric Ries had the valuable insight that\nwhen Customer Development was combined with agile development, the\nsum of two made a powerful concept he called the Lean Startup. (He also\nnamed the feedback loop I drew between the customer validation and\ndiscovery steps, calling it the “Pivot.”)\nAs one of Japan’s most innovative VCs, Takashi Tsutsumi thought the\nCustomer Development concepts so warranted adoption in Japan that he\npersonally translated The Four Steps and evangelized the concepts. Other\nentrepreneurs followed with crowd-sourced translations into French, Russian,\nKorean and Chinese. Brant Cooper and Patrick Vlaskovits extended my ideas\nin their helpful book The Entrepreneur’s Guide to Customer Development.\nAlexander Osterwalder’s work about business model design and his book\nBusiness Model Generation are a conceptual breakthroughs that I’ve adopted\nas a way to “keep score” for the Customer Discovery process. A big thanks\nfor his help. Dave McClure’s insights about demand creation for web/mobile\nstartup metrics inspired the web customer funnel discussions in several\nplaces.\nBefore anyone took my ideas seriously, Jerry Engel at U.C. Berkeley’s\nHaas Business School gave me my first forum for teaching Customer\nDevelopment. My first teaching partner, Rob Majteles, ensured that my\nenthusiasm was matched by a coherent syllabus. At Stanford University’s\nSchool of Engineering, Tom Byers, Tina Seelig and Kathy Eisenhardt were\ngracious enough to invite me to teach with them in the Stanford Technology\nVenture Program. They offered additional insights, encouragement, and\nenough rope to hang myself when I created my Lean LaunchPad class, a new\nway to teach entrepreneurship. A big thanks to the National Science\nFoundation team including Errol Arkilic, Don Millard and Babu DasGupta,\nfor adopting the Lean LaunchPad class and Customer Development for their\nInnovation Corps. And to Jon Feiber, Ann Miura Ko, John Burke, Jim\nHornthal, Alexander Osterwalder and Oren Jacob for teaching it with me.\nFinally, Columbia Business School allowed me to offer the course to its\nstudents in its joint MBA program with the U.C. Berkeley Haas School of\nBusiness and invited me to teach in its short courses. I have learned\nimmeasurably from the thousands of students who sat through my classes as\nunwitting victims of Customer Development while I experimented with new\nways to teach entrepreneurship. None of these classes would have worked\nwithout the teaching assistants who kept the wheels on over the years, most\nnotably Ann Miura-Ko, Thomas Haymore, Bhavik Joshi, Christina Cacioppo,\nand Eric Carr.\nBesides the schools where I regularly lecture, other universities have\ninvited me to teach, lecture and learn. Big thanks to: Professor Cristobal\nGarcia and the Pontificia Unversidad Catolica de Chile, in Santiago; Dave\nMunsen, dean of engineering, and Thomas Zurburchen, associate dean of\nentrepreneurship at the University of Michigan; Professor Nathan Furr of\nBrigham Young University, who turned my notion of business model\ncompetitions (instead of business plan competitions) into the first formal\ncontest; at Aalto University in Helsinki, Finland, Tuula Teeri, president, Will\nCardwell head of the Center for Entrepreneurship, and Kristo Ovaska and\nLinda Liukas, who all welcomed me; and Professor Tom Eisenmann of\nHarvard Business School’s Entrepreneurial Management Unit, with whom I\ncompare notes and teaching strategies in a semi-annual get-together.\nStephen Spinelli was at Babson when he was part of the team that taught\nme how to teach entrepreneurship, and when he became president of\nPhiladelphia University, he gave me something I didn’t deserve. Carl\nSchramm at the Kauffman Foundation turned into a friend in the pursuit of a\nnew way to think about entrepreneurial education.\nNumerous authors have written extensively (and more coherently) about\neach of the four steps of Customer Development I cover. A good many of the\nbuilding blocks of Customer Development were first articulated by Eric Von\nHippel (the Lead User), Rita Gunther McGrath and Ian MacMillan\n(Discovery-driven Growth), Mary Sonnack, Michael J. Lanning, Michael\nBosworth (Solution Selling), and Thomas Freese, Neil Rackham, Mahan\nKhalsa, Stephen Heiman, and Charles O’Reilly. Technology Life Cycle\nAdoption was developed by Joe Bohlen, George Beal and Everett Rogers and\npopularized by Geoffrey Moore. Market Type is an extension of the brilliant\nwork of Clayton Christensen. W. Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne’s work on\nBlue Ocean Strategy was a later influence on this edition of the book. A\nformal process of dealing with the chaos and uncertainty of a startup (and the\ncompany-building strategies) owes a tremendous amount to the theories of\nJohn Boyd and the OODA Loop. Frank Robinson independently came up\nwith many of the concepts in the Customer Discovery and Validation long\nbefore I wrote about them. Frank coined the term minimum viable product. I\nliked it better than minimum feature set, which I used in the first book.\nMy partner and co-author, Bob Dorf, put up with more than any coauthor could imagine. His contribution is matched only by his patience. A\nseasoned entrepreneur himself, Bob’s success as a serial entrepreneur and his\nstrengths in sales, marketing, and the Web have added immensely to our new\njoint work. I met Bob when he walked into my E.piphany office. My startup\nhad five people aboard, and his had about a dozen. I bought his sales pitch,\nand he helped me launch E.piphany’s customer development and promotion\nefforts. In 2010 he practically moved into my ranch and became my partner\nfor the second time, helping to make The Startup Owner’s Manual a work\nwe’re both proud of. The “get/keep/grow” sections and “metrics that matter”\nwere his painful labor of love. Terri Vanech, our researcher/copyeditor, had\nto deal with both of our unreasonable demands.\nThanks to our intrepid reviewers: Entrepreneurs Jake Levine at\nNews.me; Ross Gotler; Peter Leeds at Gabardine.com; Steve Weinstein of\nMovieLabs; Preston Bealle and Prescott Logan at GE’s Energy Storage\nTechnologies; venture capitalists Jon Feiber of MDV, Ann Miura-Ko at\nFloodgate, John Burke from True Ventures, Mike Barlow of Cumulus\nPartners, Takashi Tstusumi from Mitsui Sumitomo Ventures and Errol\nArkilic at the National Science Foundation. Their comments made the book\nsubstantively better by imbuing it with their hundreds of years of collective\nwisdom.\nFinally, my wife Alison Elliott who not only put up with my obsession\nwith finding a methodology for early-stage startups and my passion for\nteaching entrepreneurship, but also supported me with her wise counsel and\ninsight (along with numerous edits) which added clarity to my thinking. This\nbook would not have happened without her.\nAbout the Authors\nSteve Blank\nA RETIRED EIGHT-TIME SERIAL ENTREPRENEUR, Steve’s insight that startups\nare not small versions of large companies is reshaping the way startups are\nbuilt and how entrepreneurship is taught. His observation that large\ncompanies execute business models, but startups search for them, led him to\nrealize that startups need their own tools, different than those used to manage\nexisting companies.\nSteve’s first tool for startups, the Customer Development methodology,\nspawned the Lean Startup movement. The fundamentals of Customer\nDevelopment are detailed in Blank’s first book, The Four Steps to the\nEpiphany (2003), which together with his blog, www.steveblank.com, is\nconsidered required reading among entrepreneurs, investors and established\ncompanies throughout the world.\nBlank teaches Customer Development and entrepreneurship at Stanford\nUniversity, U.C. Berkeley Haas Business School and Columbia University,\nand his Customer Development process is taught at universities throughout\nthe world. In 2011, he developed the Lean LaunchPad, a hands-on class that\nintegrates Business Model design and Customer Development into practice\nthrough fast-paced, real-world customer interaction and business model\niteration. In 2011, the National Science Foundation adopted Blank’s class for\nits Innovation Corps (I-Corps), which trains teams of the nation’s top\nscientists and engineers to take their ideas out of the university lab and into\nthe commercial marketplace.\nSteve is a prolific writer and speaker who enjoys teaching young\nentrepreneurs. In 2009, he earned the Stanford University Undergraduate\nTeaching Award in Management Science and Engineering. In 2010, he\nearned the Earl F. Cheit Outstanding Teaching Award at U.C. Berkeley Haas\nSchool of Business. The San Jose Mercury News listed him as one of the 10\nInfluencers in Silicon Valley. Despite these accolades and many others, Steve\nsays he might well have been voted “least likely to succeed” in his New York\nCity high school class.\nEight Startups in 21 years\nAfter repairing fighter plane electronics in Thailand during the Vietnam War,\nSteve arrived in Silicon Valley in 1978, and joined his first of eight startups.\nThese included two semiconductor companies, Zilog and MIPS Computers;\nConvergent Technologies; a consulting stint for Pixar; a supercomputer firm,\nArdent; peripheral supplier, SuperMac; a military intelligence systems\nsupplier, ESL; Rocket Science Games. Steve co-founded startup number\neight, E.piphany, in his living room in 1996. In sum: two significant\nimplosions, one massive “dot-com bubble” home run, several “base hits,” and\nimmense learning that resulted in The Four Steps to the Epiphany.\nAn avid reader in history, technology, and entrepreneurship, Steve has\nfollowed his curiosity about why entrepreneurship blossomed in Silicon\nValley while stillborn elsewhere. It has made him an unofficial expert and\nfrequent speaker on “The Secret History of Silicon Valley.”\nIn his spare time, Blank is a Commissioner of the California Coastal\nCommission, the public body which regulates land use and public access on\nthe California coast. Steve served on the boards of Audubon California, the\nPeninsula Open Space Land Trust (POST), and was a trustee of U.C. Santa\nCruz and a Director of the California League of Conservation Voters\n(CLCV). Steve’s proudest startups are daughters Katie and Sarah, codeveloped with wife Alison Elliott.\nBob Dorf\nBOB DORF FOUNDED HIS FIRST SUCCESS AT AGE 22 and, since then, six more\n—“two homeruns, two base hits, and three great tax losses in all,” as he puts\nit. He’s advised and/or invested in at least a score more startups since. Dorf is\noften called the “midwife of Customer Development,” having been among\nthe first to help Steve Blank deploy it when Steve’s eighth startup, E.piphany,\nopened its doors with five employees in 1996. Bob’s sixth startup, Marketing\n1to1, helped E.piphany engage its very first customers. He later critiqued the\nearly versions of Steve’s Four Steps to the Epiphany mercilessly along the\nway, and they’ve been friends and colleagues ever since.\nWhen Bob and Steve aren’t writing, Bob runs the K&S Ranch\nconsultancy. Bob’s deep experience consulting to Fortune 500 companies\nand in online marketing balance Steve’s VC and software-centric experience.\nBob teaches a full-semester course at Columbia Business School,\n“Introduction to Venturing,” on Customer Development and getting startups\nright.\nEntrepreneurial from the age of 12, Bob received his last W-2 almost 40\nyears ago, when he quit his editor’s job at New York’s WINS Radio to\nlaunch his first startup. Dorf+Stanton Communications, founded in his living\nroom, grew from a staff of two—Bob and a St. Bernard—to 150+, when Bob\nsold it in 1989. He’s counseled dozens of nonprofits probono on “donor\ndevelopment,” as well.\nBob co-founded Marketing 1to1 (later Peppers & Rogers Group), an\nearly CRM strategy firm, and drove its growth to 400+ people worldwide. As\nfounding CEO, Dorf spearheaded major strategic customer programs at a\nveritable “who’s who” of companies including 3M, Bertelsmann, Ford, HP,\nJaguar, NCR, Oracle, and Schwab. He’s spoken before scores of U.S. and\ninternational audiences, and published dozens of articles including an indepth\nHarvard Business Review treatise.\nDorf lives in Stamford, Connecticut, with his wife Fran, a therapist and\nthrice-published novelist. His proudest startup by far is daughter Rachel, a\npsychologist who recently co-founded Bob’s first grandchild, Maya Rose\nGotler.\nIt’s not the beginning of the end, but it is perhaps the\nend of the beginning\n\n\n\n\nHooked:\nHow to Build Habit-Forming Products\nBy Nir Eyal\nwith Ryan Hoover\nCopyright © 2014 Nir Eyal\nAll rights reserved.\nISBN: 1494277530\nISBN-13: 978-1494277536\nLibrary of Congress Control Number: 2014900549\nv 1.2\nFor Julie\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIntroduction\n1.

Habit Testing and Where To Look For Habit-Forming Opportunities\nAppendix\nAbout the Authors\nAcknowledgements\nContributors\nNotes and Sources\nNote: Some sections of this book have appeared in articles previously published by the author.\nINTRODUCTION\n79 percent of smartphone owners check their device within 15 minutes of waking up every morning.\n[i]\nPerhaps more startling, fully one-third of Americans say they would rather give up sex than lose their\ncell phones.\n[ii]\nA 2011 university study suggested people check their phones 34 times per day.\n[iii] However,\nindustry insiders believe that number is closer to an astounding 150 daily sessions.\n[iv]\nFace it, we’re hooked.\nThe technologies we use have turned into compulsions, if not full-fledged addictions. It’s the\nimpulse to check a message notification. It’s the pull to visit YouTube, Facebook, or Twitter for just a\nfew minutes, only to find yourself still tapping and scrolling an hour later. It’s the urge you likely feel\nthroughout your day but hardly notice.\nCognitive psychologists define habits as, “automatic behaviors triggered by situational cues:”\nthings we do with little or no conscious thought.\n[v] The products and services we use habitually alter\nour everyday behavior, just as their designers intended.\n[vi] Our actions have been engineered.\nHow do companies, producing little more than bits of code displayed on a screen, seemingly\ncontrol users’ minds? What makes some products so habit-forming?\nFor many products, forming habits is an imperative for survival. As infinite distractions compete\nfor our attention, companies are learning to master novel tactics to stay relevant in users’ minds.\nToday, amassing millions of users is no longer good enough. Companies increasingly find that their\neconomic value is a function of the strength of the habits they create. In order to win the loyalty of\ntheir users and create a product that’s regularly used, companies must learn not only what compels\nusers to click, but also what makes them tick.\nAlthough some companies are just waking up to this new reality, others are already cashing in. By\nmastering habit-forming product design, the companies profiled in this book make their goods\nindispensable.\nFirst-To-Mind Wins\nCompanies who form strong user habits enjoy several benefits to their bottom line. These companies\nattach their product to “internal triggers.” As a result, users show up without any external prompting.\nInstead of relying on expensive marketing, habit-forming companies link their services to the users’\ndaily routines and emotions.\n[vii] A habit is at work when users feel a tad bored and instantly open\nTwitter. They feel a pang of loneliness and before rational thought occurs, they are scrolling through\ntheir Facebook feeds. A question comes to mind and before searching their brains, they query Google.\nThe first-to-mind solution wins. In chapter one, this book explores the competitive advantages of\nhabit-forming products.\nHow do products create habits? The answer: They manufacture them. While fans of the television\nshow Mad Men are familiar with how the ad industry once created consumer desire during Madison\nAvenue’s golden era, those days are long gone. A multi-screen world of ad-wary consumers has\nrendered Don Draper’s big budget brainwashing useless to all but the biggest brands.\nToday, small startup teams can profoundly change behavior by guiding users through a series of\nexperiences I call “hooks.” The more often users run through these hooks, the more likely they are to\nform habits.\nHow I Got Hooked\nIn 2008, I was among a team of Stanford MBAs starting a company backed by some of the brightest\ninvestors in Silicon Valley. Our mission was to build a platform for placing advertising into the\nbooming world of online social games.\nNotable companies were making billions of dollars selling virtual cows on digital farms while\nadvertisers were spending huge sums of money to influence people to buy whatever they were\npeddling. I admit I didn’t get it at first and found myself standing at the water’s edge wondering,\n\"How do they do it?\"\nAt the intersection of these two industries dependent on mind manipulation, I embarked upon a\njourney to learn how products change our actions and, at times, create compulsions. How did these\ncompanies engineer user behavior? What were the moral implications of building potentially\naddictive products? Most importantly, could the same forces that made these experiences so\ncompelling also be used to build products to improve people’s lives?\nWhere could I find the blueprints for forming habits? To my disappointment, I found no guide.\nBusinesses skilled in behavior design guarded their secrets and although I uncovered books, white\npapers, and blog posts tangentially related to the topic, there was no how-to manual for building\nhabit-forming products.\nI began documenting my observations of hundreds of companies to uncover patterns in user\nexperience designs and functionality. Although every business had its unique flavor, I sought to\nidentify the commonalities behind the winners and understand what was missing among the losers.\nI looked for insights from academia: drawing upon consumer psychology, human-computer\ninteraction, and behavioral economics research. In 2011, I began sharing what I learned and started\nworking as a consultant to a host of Silicon Valley companies, from small startups to Fortune 500\nenterprises. Each client provided an opportunity to test my theories, draw new insights, and refine my\nthinking. I began blogging about what I learned at NirAndFar.com and my essays were syndicated to\nother sites. Soon, readers began writing in with their own observations and examples.\nIn the fall of 2012, Dr. Baba Shiv and I designed and taught a class at the Stanford Graduate School\nof Business on the science of influencing human behavior. The next year, I partnered with Dr. Steph\nHabif to teach a similar course at the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design.\nThese years of distilled research and real-world experience resulted in the creation of the Hook\nModel: a four-phase process companies use to forms habits. Through consecutive hook cycles,\nsuccessful products reach their ultimate goal of unprompted user engagement, bringing users back\nrepeatedly, without depending on costly advertising or aggressive messaging.\nWhile I draw many examples from technology companies given my industry background, hooks are\neverywhere — in apps, sports, movies, games, and even our jobs. Hooks can be found in virtually\nany experience that burrows into our minds (and often our wallets). The four steps of the Hook Model\nprovide the framework for the chapters of this book.\nThe Hook Model\n1. Trigger\nA trigger is the actuator of behavior — the spark plug in the engine. Triggers come in two types:\nexternal and internal.\n[viii] Habit-forming products start by alerting users with external triggers like an\nemail, a website link, or the app icon on a phone.\nFor example, suppose Barbra, a young woman in Pennsylvania, happens to see a photo in her\nFacebook newsfeed taken by a family member from a rural part of the state. It’s a lovely picture and\nsince she is planning a trip there with her brother Johnny, the external trigger’s call-to-action intrigues\nher and she clicks. By cycling through successive hooks, users begin to form associations with\ninternal triggers, which attach to existing behaviors and emotions.\nWhen users start to automatically cue their next behavior, the new habit becomes part of their\neveryday routine. Over time, Barbra associates Facebook with her need for social connection.\nChapter two explores external and internal triggers, answering the question of how product designers\ndetermine which triggers are most effective.\n2. Action\nFollowing the trigger comes the action: the behavior done in anticipation of a reward. The simple\naction of clicking on the interesting picture in her newsfeed takes Barbra to a website called\nPinterest, a “pinboard-style photo-sharing” site.\n[ix]\nThis phase of the hook, as described in chapter three, draws upon the art and science of usability\ndesign to reveal how products drive specific user actions. Companies leverage two basic pulleys of\nhuman behavior to increase the likelihood of an action occurring: the ease of performing an action and\nthe psychological motivation to do it.\n[x]\nOnce Barbra completes the simple action of clicking on the photo, she is dazzled by what she sees\nnext.\n3. Variable Reward\nWhat distinguishes the Hook Model from a plain vanilla feedback loop is the hook’s ability to create\na craving. Feedback loops are all around us, but predictable ones don’t create desire. The\nunsurprising response of your fridge light turning on when you open the door doesn’t drive you to\nkeep opening it again and again. However, add some variability to the mix — say a different treat\nmagically appears in your fridge every time you open it — and voila, intrigue is created.\nVariable rewards are one of the most powerful tools companies implement to hook users; chapter\nfour explains them in further detail. Research shows that levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine\nsurge when the brain is expecting a reward.\n[xi]\nIntroducing variability multiplies the effect, creating a\nfocused state, which suppresses the areas of the brain associated with judgment and reason while\nactivating the parts associated with wanting and desire.\n[xii] Although classic examples include slot\nmachines and lotteries, variable rewards are prevalent in many other habit-forming products.\nWhen Barbra lands on Pinterest, not only does she see the image she intended to find, but she is\nalso served a multitude of other glittering objects. The images are related to what she is generally\ninterested in — namely things to see on her upcoming trip to rural Pennsylvania — but there are other\nthings that catch her eye as well. The exciting juxtaposition of relevant and irrelevant, tantalizing and\nplain, beautiful and common, sets her brain’s dopamine system aflutter with the promise of reward.\nNow she’s spending more time on Pinterest, hunting for the next wonderful thing to find. Before she\nknows it, she’s spent 45 minutes scrolling.\nChapter four also explores why some people eventually lose their taste for certain experiences and\nhow variability impacts their retention.\n4. Investment\nThe last phase of the Hook Model is where the user does a bit of work. The investment phase\nincreases the odds that the user will make another pass through the hook cycle in the future. The\ninvestment occurs when the user puts something into the product of service such as time, data, effort,\nsocial capital, or money.\nHowever, the investment phase isn’t about users opening up their wallets and moving on with their\nday. Rather, the investment implies an action that improves the service for the next go-around. Inviting\nfriends, stating preferences, building virtual assets, and learning to use new features are all\ninvestments users make to improve their experience. These commitments can be leveraged to make\nthe trigger more engaging, the action easier, and the reward more exciting with every pass through the\nhook cycle. Chapter five delves into how investments encourage users to cycle through successive\nhooks.\nAs Barbra enjoys endlessly scrolling through the Pinterest cornucopia, she builds a desire to keep\nthe things that delight her. By collecting items, she’ll be giving the site data about her preferences.\nSoon she will follow, pin, re-pin, and make other investments, which serve to increase her ties to the\nsite and prime her for future loops through the hook.\nA New Superpower\nHabit-forming technology is already here, and it is being used to mold our lives. The fact that we\nhave greater access to the web through our various connected devices — smartphones and tablets,\ntelevisions, game consoles, and wearable technology — gives companies far greater ability to affect\nour behavior.\nAs companies combine their increased connectivity to consumers, with the ability to collect, mine,\nand process customer data at faster speeds, we are faced with a future where everything becomes\npotentially more habit-forming. As famed Silicon Valley investor Paul Graham writes, \"…unless the\nforms of technological progress that produced these things are subject to different laws than\ntechnological progress in general, the world will get more addictive in the next 40 years than it did in\nthe last 40.\"\n[xiii] Chapter six explores this new reality and discusses the morality of manipulation.\nRecently, a blog reader emailed me, “If it can’t be used for evil, it’s not a superpower.” He’s right.\nAnd under this definition, building habit-forming products is indeed a superpower. If used\nirresponsibly, bad habits can quickly degenerate into mindless zombie-like addictions.\nDid you recognize Barbra and her brother Johnny from the previous example? Zombie film buffs\nlikely did. They are characters from the classic horror flick Night of the Living Dead, a story about\npeople possessed by a mysterious force, which compels their every action.\n[xiv]\nNo doubt you’ve noticed the resurgence of the zombie genre over the past several years. Games\nlike Resident Evil, television shows like The Walking Dead, and movies including World War Z , are\na testament to the creatures’ growing appeal. But why are zombies suddenly so fascinating? Perhaps\ntechnology’s unstoppable progress — ever more pervasive and persuasive — has grabbed us in a\nfearful malaise at the thought of being involuntarily controlled.\nAlthough the fear is palpable, we are like the heroes in every zombie film — threatened but\nultimately more powerful. I have come to learn that habit-forming products can do far more good than\nharm. “Choice architecture,” as described by famed scholars Thaler, Sunstein, and Balz, offers\ntechniques to influence people’s decisions and affect behavioral outcomes. Ultimately though, the\npractice should be, “used to help nudge people to make better choices (as judged by themselves).”\n[xv]\nAccordingly, this book teaches innovators how to build products to help people do the things they\nalready want to do but, for lack of a solution, don’t do.\nHooked seeks to unleash the tremendous new powers innovators and entrepreneurs have to\ninfluence the everyday lives of billions of people. I believe the trinity of access, data, and speed\npresents unprecedented opportunities to create positive habits. When harnessed correctly, technology\ncan enhance lives through healthful behaviors that improve our relationships, make us smarter, and\nincrease productivity.\nThe Hook Model explains the rationale behind the design of many successful habit-forming\nproducts and services we use daily. Although not exhaustive given the vast amount of academic\nliterature available, the model is intended to be a practical tool (rather than a theoretical one) made\nfor entrepreneurs and innovators who aim to use habits for good. In this book, I have compiled the\nmost relevant research, shared actionable insights, and provided a practical framework designed to\nincrease the innovator’s odds of success.\nHooks connect the user’s problem with a company’s solution frequently enough to form a habit. My\ngoal is to provide you with a deeper understanding of how certain products change what we do, and\nby extension, who we are.\n***\nHow to Use this Book\nAt the end of each section, you’ll find a few bulleted takeaways. Reviewing them, jotting them down\nin a notebook, or sharing them on a social network is a great way to pause, reflect, and reinforce what\nyou have read.\nBuilding a habit-forming product yourself? If so, the “Do This Now” sections at the end of\nsubsequent chapters will help guide your next steps.\n***\nRemember and Share\n- Habits are defined as behaviors done with little or no conscious thought.\n- The convergence of access, data, and speed is making the world a more habit-forming place.\n- Businesses that create customer habits gain a significant competitive advantage.\n- The Hook Model describes an experience designed to connect the user's problem to a solution\nfrequently enough to form a habit.\n- The Hook Model has four phases: trigger, action, variable reward, and investment.\n[xvi]\n1. THE HABIT ZONE\nWhen I run, I zone out. I don’t think about what my body is doing and my mind usually wanders\nelsewhere. I find it relaxing and refreshing, and run about three mornings each week. Recently, I\nneeded to take an overseas client call during my usual morning run time. “No biggie,” I thought. “I can\nrun in the evening instead.” However, the time-shift created some peculiar behaviors that night.\nI left the house for my run at dusk and as I was about to pass a woman taking out her trash, she\nmade eye contact and smiled. I politely saluted with, “Good morning!” — then caught my mistake. “I\nmean, good evening! Sorry!” I corrected myself, realizing I was about 10 hours off. She furrowed her\nbrow and cracked a nervous smile.\nSlightly embarrassed, I noted how my mind had been oblivious to the time of day. I chided myself\nnot to do it again, but within a few minutes I passed another runner and again — as if possessed — I\nblurted out, “Good morning!” What was going on?\nBack home, during my normal post-run shower, my mind began to wander again as it often does\nwhen I bathe. My brain’s autopilot switch turned on and I proceeded with my daily routine, unaware\nof my actions.\nIt wasn’t until I felt the nick of the razor cutting my face that I realized I had lathered-up and started\nshaving. Although it is something I do every morning, shaving was painfully unnecessary in the\nevening. And yet, I’d done it anyway, unknowingly.\nThe evening version of my morning run had triggered a behavioral script that instructed my body to\ncarry out my usual, run-related activities — all without mindful awareness. Such is the nature of\ningrained habits — behaviors done with little or no conscious thought — which by some estimates,\nguide nearly half of our daily actions.\n[xvii]\nHabits are one of the ways the brain learns complex behaviors. Neuroscientists believe habits give\nus the ability to focus our attention on other things by storing automatic responses in the basal ganglia,\nan area of the brain associated with involuntary actions.\n[xviii]\nHabits form when the brain takes a shortcut and stops actively deliberating over what to do next.\n[xix]\nThe brain quickly learns to codify behaviors that provide a solution to whatever situation it\nencounters.\nFor example, nail biting is a common behavior that occurs with little or no conscious thought.\nInitially, the biter might start chomping on her cuticles for a reason — to remove an unsightly\nhangnail, for example. However, when the behavior occurs for no conscious purpose — simply as an\nautomatic response to a cue — the habit is in control. For many persistent nail biters, the unconscious\ntrigger is the unpleasant feeling of stress. The more the biter associates the act of nail chomping with\nthe temporary relief it provides, the harder it becomes to change the conditioned response.\nLike nail biting, many of our daily decisions are made simply because that was the way we have\nfound resolution in the past. The brain automatically deduces that if the decision was a good one\nyesterday, then it is a safe bet again today and the action becomes a routine.\nOn my run, my brain had associated making eye contact with another person during my run with the\nstandard “Good morning!” greeting, thus I automatically uttered these words no matter how\ninappropriately timed.\nWhy Habits are Good for Business\nIf our programmed behaviors are so influential in guiding our everyday actions, surely harnessing\nthe same power of habits can be a boon for industry. Indeed, for those able to shape them in an\neffective way, habits can be very good for the bottom line.\nHabit-forming products change user behavior and create unprompted user engagement. The aim is\nto influence customers to use your product on their own, again and again, without relying on overt\ncalls-to-action such as ads or promotions. Once a habit is formed, the user is automatically triggered\nto use the product during routine events such as wanting to kill time while waiting in line.\nHowever, the framework and practices explored in this book are not one-size-fits-all and do not\napply to every business or industry. Entrepreneurs should evaluate how user habits impact their\nparticular business model and goals. While the viability of some products depends on habit-formation\nto thrive, that is not always the case.\nFor example, companies selling infrequently bought or used products or services do not require\nhabitual users — at least, not in the sense of everyday engagement. Life insurance companies, for\ninstance, leverage salespeople, advertising, and word-of-mouth referrals and recommendations to\nprompt consumers to buy policies. Once the policy is bought, there is nothing more the customer\nneeds to do.\nIn this book, I refer to products in the context of businesses that require ongoing, unprompted user\nengagement and therefore need to build user habits. I exclude companies that compel customers to\ntake action through other means.\nBefore diving into the mechanics of how habits are made, we must first understand their general\nimportance and competitive benefits for businesses. Habit formation is good for business in several\nways.\nIncreasing Customer Lifetime Value\nMBAs are taught that a business is worth the sum of its future profits. This benchmark is how\ninvestors calculate the fair price of a company’s shares.\nCEOs and their management teams are evaluated by their ability to increase the value of their\nstocks — and therefore care deeply about the ability of their companies to generate free cash flow.\nManagement’s job, in the eyes of shareholders, is to implement strategies to grow future profits by\nincreasing revenues or decreasing expenses.\nFostering consumer habits is an effective way to increase the value of a company by driving higher\ncustomer lifetime value (CLTV). CLTV is the amount of money made from a customer before she\nswitches to a competitor, stops using the product, or dies. User habits increase how long and how\nfrequently customers use a product, resulting in higher CLTV.\nSome products have a very high CLTV. For example, credit card customers tend to stay loyal for a\nvery long time and are worth a bundle. Hence, credit card companies are willing to spend a\nconsiderable amount of money acquiring new customers. This explains why you receive so many\npromotional offers, ranging from free gifts to airline bonus miles, to entice you to add another card or\nupgrade your current one. Your potential CLTV justifies a credit card company’s marketing\ninvestment.\nProviding Pricing Flexibility\nRenowned investor and Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett once said, “You can determine the\nstrength of a business over time by the amount of agony they go through in raising prices.”\n[xx] Buffett\nand his partner, Charlie Munger, realized that as customers form routines around a product, they come\nto depend upon it and become less price-sensitive. The duo have pointed to consumer psychology as\nthe rationale behind their famed investments in companies like See’s Candies and Coca-Cola.\n[xxi]\nBuffett and Munger understand that habits give companies greater flexibility to increase prices.\nFor example, in the free-to-play video game business, it is standard practice for game developers\nto delay asking users to pay money until they have played consistently and habitually. Once the\ncompulsion to play is in place and the desire to progress in the game increases, converting users into\npaying customers is much easier. Selling virtual items, extra lives, and special powers is where the\nreal money lies.\nAs of December 2013, more than 500 million people have downloaded Candy Crush Saga, a game\nplayed mostly on mobile devices. The game’s “freemium” model converts some of those users into\npaying customers, netting the game’s maker nearly a million dollars per day.\n[xxii]\nThis pattern also applies to other services. Take Evernote, the popular note-taking and archiving\nsoftware, for example. The software is free to use but the company offers upgraded features like\noffline viewing and collaboration tools for a price — which many devoted users are happy to pay.\nEvernote’s CEO Phil Libin shared some revealing insights about how the company turns nonpaying users into revenue generating ones.\n[xxiii]\nIn 2011, Libin published a chart now known as the\n“smile graph.” With the percentage of sign-ups represented on the Y-axis and time spent on the\nservice on the X-axis, the chart showed that, although usage plummeted at first, it rocketed upward as\npeople formed a habit of using the service. The resulting down and up curve gave the chart its\nemblematic smile shape (and Evernote’s CEO a matching grin).\nIn addition, as usage increased over time, so did customers’ willingness to pay. Libin noted that\nafter the first month, only 0.5 percent of users paid for the service; however, this rate gradually\nincreased. By month 33, 11 percent of users had started paying. At month 42, a remarkable 26 percent\nof customers were paying for something they had previously used for free.\n[xxiv]\nSupercharging Growth\nUsers who continually find value in a product are more likely to tell their friends about it. Frequent\nusage creates more opportunities to encourage people to invite their friends, broadcast content, and\nshare through word-of-mouth. Hooked users become brand evangelists — megaphones for your\ncompany, bringing in new users at little or no cost.\nProducts with higher user engagement also have the potential to grow faster than their rivals. Case\nin point: Facebook leapfrogged its competitors, including MySpace and Friendster, even though it\nwas relatively late to the social networking party. Although its competitors both had healthy growth\nrates and millions of users by the time Mark Zuckerberg’s fledgling site launched beyond the closed\ndoors of academia, his company came to dominate the industry.\nFacebook’s success was, in part, a result of what I call the more is more principle — more\nfrequent usage drives more viral growth. As tech-entrepreneur turned venture capitalist, David Skok\npoints out, “The most important factor to increasing growth is ... Viral Cycle Time.”\n[xxv] Viral Cycle\nTime is the amount of time it takes a user to invite another user, and it can have a massive impact.\n“For example, after 20 days with a cycle time of two days, you will have 20,470 users,” Skok writes.\n“But if you halved that cycle time to one day, you would have over 20 million users! It is logical that\nit would be better to have more cycles occur, but it is less obvious just how much better.”\nHaving a greater proportion of users returning to a service daily, dramatically increases Viral\nCycle Time for two reasons: First, daily users initiate loops more often (think tagging a friend in a\nFacebook photo); second, more daily active users means more people to respond and react to each\ninvitation. The cycle not only perpetuates the process — with higher and higher user engagement, it\naccelerates it.\nSharpening the Competitive Edge\nUser habits are a competitive advantage. Products that change customer routines are less susceptible\nto attacks from other companies.\nMany entrepreneurs fall into the trap of building products that are only marginally better than\nexisting solutions, hoping their innovation will be good enough to woo customers away from existing\nproducts. But when it comes to shaking consumers’ old habits, these naive entrepreneurs often find\nthat better products don’t always win — especially if a large number of users have already adopted a\ncompeting product.\nA classic paper by John Gourville, a professor of marketing at Harvard Business School, stipulates\nthat, “Many innovations fail because consumers irrationally overvalue the old while companies\nirrationally overvalue the new.”\n[xxvi]\nGourville claims that for new entrants to stand a chance, they can’t just be better, they must be nine\ntimes better. Why such a high bar? Because old habits die hard and new products or services need to\noffer dramatic improvements to shake users out of old routines. Gourville writes that products that\nrequire a high degree of behavior change are doomed to fail even if the benefits of using the new\nproduct are clear and substantial.\nFor example, the technology I am using to write this book is inferior to existing alternatives in\nmany ways. I’m referring to the QWERTY keyboard which was first developed in the 1870s for the\nnow-ancient typewriter. QWERTY was designed with commonly used characters spaced far apart.\nThis layout prevented typists from jamming the metal typebars of early machines.\n[xxvii] Of course, this\nphysical limitation is an anachronism in the digital age, yet QWERTY keyboards remain the standard\ndespite the invention of far better layouts.\nProfessor August Dvorak’s keyboard design, for example, placed vowels in the center row,\nincreasing typing speed and accuracy. Though patented in 1932, the Dvorak Simplified Keyboard was\nwritten off.\nQWERTY survives due to the high costs of changing user behavior. When first introduced to the\nkeyboard, we chicken-peck at the keys one-by-one, usually with just a finger or two. After months of\npractice, we instinctively learn to activate all our fingers in response to our thoughts with little to no\nconscious effort, and the words begin to flow effortlessly from mind to screen. But switching to an\nunfamiliar keyboard — even if more efficient — would force us to re-learn how to type. Fat chance!\nAs we will learn in chapter five, users also increase their dependency on habit-forming products\nby storing value in them — further reducing the likelihood of switching to an alternative. For\nexample, every email sent and received using Google’s Gmail is stored indefinitely, providing users\nwith a lasting repository of past conversations. New followers on Twitter increase users’ clout and\namplify their ability to transmit messages to their communities. Memories and experiences captured\non Instagram are added to one’s digital scrapbook. Switching to a new email service, social network,\nor photo-sharing app becomes more difficult the more people use them. The non-transferrable value\ncreated and stored inside these services discourages users from leaving.\nUltimately, user habits increase a business's return on investment. Higher customer lifetime value,\ngreater pricing flexibility, supercharged growth, and a sharpened competitive edge together equal a\nmore powerful bang for the company’s buck.\n***\nBuilding the Mind Monopoly\nWhile user habits are a boon to companies fortunate enough to engender them, their existence\ninherently makes success less likely for new innovations and startups trying to disrupt the status quo.\nThe fact is, successfully changing long-term user habits is exceptionally rare.\nAltering behavior requires not only an understanding of how to persuade people to act — for\nexample, the first time they land on a webpage — but also necessitates getting them to repeat\nbehaviors for long periods, ideally for the rest of their lives.\nCompanies that succeed in building a habit-forming business are often associated with gamechanging, wildly successful innovation. But like any discipline, habit design has rules and caveats that\ndefine and explain why some products change lives while others do not.\nFor one, new behaviors have a short half-life, as our minds tend to revert to our old ways of\nthinking and doing. Experiments show that lab animals habituated to new behaviors tend to regress to\ntheir first learned behaviors over time.\n[xxviii] To borrow a term from accounting, behaviors are LIFO —\n“last in, first out.” In other words, the habits you’ve most recently acquired are also the ones most\nlikely to go soonest.\nThis helps explain the overwhelming evidence that people rarely change their habits for long.\nTwo-thirds of alcoholics who complete a rehabilitation program will pick up the bottle, and their old\nhabits, within a year’s time.\n[xxix] Research shows that nearly everyone who loses weight on a diet gains\nback the pounds within two years.\n[xxx]\nThe enemy of forming new habits is past behaviors, and research suggests that old habits die hard.\nEven when we change our routines, neural pathways remain etched in our brains, ready to be\nreactivated when we lose focus.\n[xxxi] This presents an especially difficult challenge for product\ndesigners trying to create new lines or businesses based on forming new habits.\nFor new behaviors to really take hold, they must occur often. In a recent study at the University\nCollege London, researchers followed participants as they attempted to form a habit of flossing their\nteeth.\n[xxxii] As one of its findings, the study concluded that the more frequently the new behavior\noccurred, the stronger the habit became. Like flossing, frequent engagement with a product —especially over a short period of time — increases the likelihood of forming new routines.\nGoogle Search provides an example of a service built upon a frequent behavior that helped create\nusers’ habits. If you’re skeptical that Google is habit-forming (and you are a frequent Google user),\njust try using Bing. In a head-to-head comparison of the efficacy of an incognito search, the products\nare nearly identical.\n[xxxiii] Even if the geniuses at Google have in fact perfected a faster algorithm, the\ntime saved is imperceptible to everyone but robots and Mister Spock. Milliseconds matter, but they\ndon’t hook users.\nSo why haven’t more Google users switched to Bing? Habits keep users loyal. If a user is familiar\nwith the Google interface, switching to Bing requires cognitive effort. Although many aspects of Bing\nare similar to Google, even a slight change in pixel placement forces the would-be user to learn a\nnew way of interacting with the site. Adapting to the differences in the Bing interface is what actually\nslows down regular Google users and makes Bing feel inferior, not the technology itself.\nInternet searches occur so frequently that Google is able to cement itself as the one and only\nsolution in the habituated user’s mind. Users no longer need to think about whether or not to use\nGoogle, they just do. Furthermore, whenever the company can identify the user through tracking\ntechnology, it improves search results based on past behaviors to deliver a more accurate and\npersonalized experience, reinforcing the user’s connection with the search engine. The more the\nproduct is used, the better the algorithm gets and thus, the more it is used. The result is a virtuous\ncycle of habit-driven behavior resulting in Google’s market domination.\n[xxxiv]\nHabit as Strategy\nSometimes a behavior does not occur as frequently as flossing or Googling, but it still becomes a\nhabit. For an infrequent action to become a habit, the user must perceive a high degree of utility,\neither from gaining pleasure or avoiding pain.\nTake Amazon as an example: The e-tailer has its sights set on becoming the world’s one-stop shop.\nAmazon is so confident in its ability to form user habits that it sells and runs ads for directly\ncompetitive products on its site.\n[xxxv] Customers often see the item they are about to buy listed at a\ncheaper price and can click away to transact elsewhere. To some, this sounds like a formula for\ndisaster. But to Amazon, it is a shrewd business strategy.\nNot only does Amazon make money from the ads it runs from competing businesses, but it also\nutilizes other companies’ marketing dollars to form a habit in the shopper’s mind. Amazon seeks to\nbecome the solution to a frequently occurring pain-point — the customer’s desire to find the items\nthey want.\nBy addressing shoppers’ price concerns, Amazon earns loyalty even if it doesn’t make the sale, and\ncomes across as trustworthy in the process. The tactic is backed by a 2003 study, which demonstrated\nthat consumers’ preference for an online retailer increases when they are offered competitive price\ninformation.\n[xxxvi] The technique has also been used by Progressive, the car insurance company, to drive\nover $15 billion of annual insurance sales, up from just $3.4 billion before the tactic was\nimplemented.\nBy allowing users to comparison shop from within the site, Amazon provides tremendous\nperceived utility to its customers. Although shopping on Amazon may not occur as frequently as\nsearching on Google, the company solidifies its place as the default solution to customers’ purchasing\nneeds with each successful transaction. In fact, people are so comfortable comparison shopping on\nAmazon that they frequently use the company’s mobile app to check prices when standing in the aisles\nof real stores — often making a purchase from inside a competing retailer.\n[xxxvii]\nIn the Habit Zone\nA company can begin to determine its product’s habit-forming potential by plotting two factors:\nfrequency (how often the behavior occurs) and perceived utility (how useful and rewarding the\nbehavior is in the user’s mind over alternative solutions).\nGoogling occurs multiple times per day, but any particular search is negligibly better than rival\nservices like Bing. Conversely, using Amazon may be a less frequent occurrence, but users receive\ngreat value knowing they’ll find whatever they need at the one and only “everything store.”\n[xxxviii]\nAs represented in figure 1, a behavior that occurs with enough frequency and perceived utility\nenters the Habit Zone, helping to make it a default behavior. If either of these factors falls short and\nthe behavior lies below the threshold, it is less likely that the desired behavior will become a habit.\nNote that the line slopes downward but never quite reaches the perceived utility axis. Some\nbehaviors never become habits because they do not occur frequently enough. No matter how much\nutility is involved, infrequent behaviors remain conscious actions and never create the automatic\nresponse that is characteristic of habits. On the other axis however, even a behavior which provides\nminimal perceived benefit can become a habit simply because it occurs frequently.\nFigure 1\nThis concept is meant to be a guiding theory and the scale of the illustration is intentionally left\nblank. Unfortunately for companies, research thus far has not found a universal timescale for turning\nall behaviors into habits. A 2010 study found that some habits can be formed in a matter of weeks\nwhile others can take more than five months.\n[xxxix] The researchers also found that the complexity of the\nbehavior and how important the habit was to the person greatly affected how quickly the routine was\nformed.\nThere are few rules when it comes to answering “how frequent is frequent enough?” and the\nanswer is likely specific to each business and behavior. However, as the previously mentioned\nflossing study demonstrates, we know that higher frequency is better.\nThink of the products and services you would identify as habit-forming. Most of these are used\ndaily, if not multiple times per day. Now, let’s explore why we use these products so frequently.\n***\nVitamins vs. Painkillers\nIt’s never been easier to launch a new product or service, yet most new endeavors fail. Why?\nProducts fail for a variety of reasons: Companies run out of funding, products enter markets too early\nor too late, the marketplace doesn’t need what companies are offering, or founders simply give up.\nJust as failure has many causes, success too can be attributed to a variety of factors. However, one\nthing is common to all successful innovations — they solve problems. That may seem obvious, but\nunderstanding the kind of problem a new product solves can be a topic of much debate.\n“Are you building a vitamin or painkiller?” is a common, almost clichéd question many investors\nask founders eager to cash their first venture capital check. The correct answer, from the perspective\nof most investors, is the latter: a painkiller. Likewise, innovators in companies big and small are\nconstantly asked to prove their idea is important enough to merit the time and money needed to build\nit. Gatekeepers such as investors and managers want to invest in solving real problems — or, meeting\nimmediate needs — by backing painkillers.\nPainkillers solve an obvious need, relieving a specific pain and often have quantifiable markets.\nThink Tylenol, the brand name version of acetaminophen, and the product’s promise of reliable relief.\nIt’s the kind of ready-made solution for which people are happy to pay.\nIn contrast, vitamins do not necessarily solve an obvious pain-point. Instead they appeal to users’\nemotional rather than functional needs. When we take our multivitamin each morning, we don't really\nknow if it is actually making us healthier. In fact, recent evidence shows taking multivitamins may\nactually be doing more harm than good.\n[xl]\nBut we don't really care, do we? Efficacy is not why we take vitamins. Taking a vitamin is a\n\"check it off your list\" behavior we measure in terms of psychological, rather than physical, relief.\nWe feel satisfied that we are doing something good for our bodies — even if we can’t tell how much\ngood it is actually doing us.\nUnlike a painkiller, which we can not function without, missing a few days of vitamin popping, say\nwhile on vacation, is no big deal. So perhaps managers and investors know best? Perhaps building\npainkillers, not vitamins, is always the right strategy.\nNot so fast.\nLet’s consider a few of today’s hottest consumer technology companies — say Facebook, Twitter,\nInstagram, and Pinterest. What are they selling — vitamins or painkillers? Most people would guess\nvitamins, thinking users aren’t doing much of anything important other than perhaps seeking a quick\nboost of social validation. After all, think back to before you first started using these services. No one\never woke up in the middle of the night screaming, “I need something to help me update my status!”\nBut like so many innovations, we did not know we needed them until they became part of our\neveryday lives. Before making up your mind on the vitamin or painkiller debate for some of the\nworld’s most successful tech companies, consider this idea: A habit is when not doing an action\ncauses a bit of pain.\nIt is important to clarify that the term “pain,” as it is frequently used in business school and\nmarketing books, is somewhat hyperbolic. In reality, the experience we are talking about is more\nsimilar to an “itch,” a feeling that manifests within the mind and causes discomfort until it is satisfied.\nThe habit-forming products we use are simply there to provide some sort of relief. Using a technology\nor product to scratch the itch provides faster satisfaction than ignoring it. Once we come to depend on\na tool, nothing else will do.\nMy answer to the vitamin or painkiller question is that habit-forming technologies are both. These\nservices seem, at first, to be offering nice-to-have vitamins, but once the habit is established, they\nprovide an ongoing pain remedy.\nSeeking pleasure and avoiding pain are two key motivators in all species. When we feel\ndiscomfort, we seek to escape the uncomfortable sensation. In the next chapter, we will explore how\nemotions, often negative ones, trigger users to reach for solutions. But for now, the important thing to\nremember is that habit-forming products create associations in users’ minds — and that the solution to\ntheir pain may be found in your product’s use.\nWe’ll discuss the morality of manipulation in chapter eight; however, it is worth noting that\nalthough some people use the terms interchangeably, habits are not the same things as addictions.\nAddictions are persistent, compulsive dependencies on a behavior or substance. Addictions, by\ndefinition, are self-destructive. Thus, it is irresponsible to make products that rely on creating and\nmaintaining user addiction, since doing so would mean intentionally harming people.\nA habit, on the other hand, is a behavior that can have a positive influence on a person’s life.\nHabits can be healthy or unhealthy, and you likely have several helpful habits you carry out throughout\nyour day. Did you brush your teeth today? Take a shower? Did you express gratitude by saying\n“thanks?” Or in my case, say “Good morning” while on an evening jog? These are common behaviors\ndone with little or no deliberation — they are habits.\n***\nDiving Into The Hook Model\nReady to learn more about creating positive user habits? Read on to gain a deeper understanding of\nthe Hook Model: A simple yet powerful way to help your customers form habits that connect their\nproblem with your solution.\nIn the next chapters, we dive into each phase of the Hook Model. Along the way, I will provide\nexamples you can use in the design of your own product or service. By learning a few fundamentals of\nhow the mind works, you will increase your odds of building the right product faster.\nBy progressing users through the four steps of the Hook Model, — trigger, action, variable reward,\nand investment — hooks form habits.\n***\nRemember and Share\n- For some businesses, forming habits is a critical component to success, but not every business\nrequires habitual user engagement.\n- When successful, forming strong user habits can have several business benefits including:\nhigher customer lifetime value, greater pricing flexibility, supercharged growth, and a sharper\ncompetitive edge.\n- Habits can not form outside the “Habit Zone,” where the behavior occurs with enough\nfrequency and perceived utility.\n- Habit-forming products often start as nice-to-haves (vitamins) but once the habit is formed,\nthey become must-haves (painkillers).\n- Habit-forming products alleviate users’ pain by relieving a pronounced itch.\n- Designing habit-forming products is a form of manipulation. Product builders would benefit\nfrom a bit of introspection before attempting to hook users to make sure they are building healthy\nhabits, not unhealthy addictions (more to come on this topic in chapter eight).\n***\nDo This Now\nIf you are building a habit-forming product, write down the answers to these questions:\n- What habits does your business model require?\n- What problem are users turning to your product to solve?\n- How do users currently solve that problem and why does it need a solution?\n- How frequently do you expect users to engage with your product?\n- What user behavior do you want to make into a habit?\n\n\n2. TRIGGER\nYin (not her real name) is in her mid-twenties, lives in Palo Alto, and attends Stanford University.\nShe has all the composure and polish you’d expect of a student at a prestigious school, yet she\nsuccumbs to a persistent habit throughout her day. She can’t help it; she is compulsively hooked on\nInstagram.\nThe photo and video-sharing social network, purchased by Facebook for $1 billion in 2012, has\ncaptured the minds and attention of Yin and 150 million other users like her.\n[xli] The company’s\nacquisition demonstrates the increasing power of — and immense monetary value created by —habit-forming technology. Of course, the Instagram purchase price was driven by a host of factors,\nincluding a rumored bidding war for the company.\n[xlii] But at its core, Instagram is an example of an\nenterprising team — conversant in psychology as much as technology — that unleashed a habitforming product on users who subsequently made it a part of their daily routines.\n[xliii]\nYin doesn’t realize she’s hooked, although she admits she regularly snaps and posts dozens of\npictures per day using the app. “It’s just fun,” she says as she reviews her latest collection of moody\nsnapshots filtered to look like they were taken in the late 1970s. “I don’t have a problem or anything. I\njust use it whenever I see something cool. I feel I need to grab it before it’s gone.”\nWhat formed Yin’s Instagram habit? How did this seemingly simple app become such an important\npart of her life? As we will soon learn, habits like Yin’s are formed over time, but the chain reaction\nthat forms a habit always starts with a trigger.\nHabits are not Created, They are Built Upon\nHabits are like pearls. Oysters create natural pearls by accumulating layer upon layer of a nacre\ncalled mother-of-pearl, eventually forming the smooth treasure over several years. But what causes\nthe nacre to begin forming a pearl? The arrival of a tiny irritant, such as a piece of grit or an\nunwelcome parasite, triggers the oyster’s system to begin blanketing the invader with layers of\nshimmery coating.\nSimilarly, new habits need a foundation upon which to build. Triggers provide the basis for\nsustained behavior change.\nReflect on your own life for a moment. What woke you up this morning? What caused you to brush\nyour teeth? What brought you to read this book?\nTriggers take the form of obvious cues like the morning alarm, but also come as more subtle,\nsometimes subconscious signals that just as effectively influence our daily behavior. A trigger is the\nactuator of behavior — the grit in the oyster that precipitates the pearl. Whether we are cognizant of\nthem or not, triggers move us to take action.\nTriggers come in two types: external and internal.\nExternal Triggers\nHabit-forming technologies start changing behavior by first cueing users with a call-to-action. This\nsensory stimuli is delivered through any number of things in our environment. External triggers are\nembedded with information, which tells the user what to do next.\nAn external trigger communicates the next action the user should take. Often, the desired action is\nmade explicitly clear. For example, what external triggers do you see in this Coca-Cola vending\nmachine in figure 2?\nFigure 2\nTake a close look at the welcoming man in the image. He is offering you a refreshing Coke. The\ntext “Thirsty?” below the image tells you what the man in the photo is asking and prompts the next\nexpected action of inserting money and selecting a beverage.\nOnline, an external trigger may take the form of a prominent button, such as the large orange “Log\nin to Mint” prompt in the email from Mint.com in figure 3. Here again, the user is given explicit\ninstructions about what action to take after reading the email: Click on that big bright button.\nFigure 3\nNotice how prominent and clear the intended action is in the email from Mint? The company could\nhave included several other triggers such as prompts to check your bank balance, view credit card\ndeals, or set financial goals. Instead, since this is an important account alert email, Mint has reduced\nthe available actions to a single click: Logging in to view and fix your account.\nMore choices require the user to evaluate multiple options. Too many choices or irrelevant options\ncan cause hesitation, confusion, or worse, abandonment.\n[xliv] Reducing the thinking required to take the\nnext action increases the likelihood of the desired behavior occurring unconsciously. We’ll explore\nthis further in the next chapter.\nThe Coca-Cola vending machine and Mint.com email provide good examples of explicit external\ntriggers. However, external triggers can also convey implicit information about the next desired user\naction. For example, we’ve all learned that website links are for clicking and app icons are for\ntapping. The only purpose for these common visual triggers is to prompt the user to action. As a\nreadily accepted aspect of interface design, these calls to action don’t need to tell people how to use\nthem, the information is embedded.\nTypes of External Triggers\nCompanies can utilize four types of external triggers to move users to complete desired actions:\n1. Paid Triggers\nAdvertising, search engine marketing, and other paid channels are commonly used to get users’\nattention and prompt them to act. Paid triggers can be effective but costly ways to keep users coming\nback. Habit-forming companies tend not to rely on paid triggers for very long, if at all. Imagine if\nFacebook or Twitter needed to buy an ad to prompt users to revisit their sites — these companies\nwould soon go broke.\nSince paying for re-engagement is unsustainable for most business models, companies generally\nuse paid triggers to acquire new users and then leverage other triggers to bring them back.\n2. Earned Triggers\nEarned triggers are free in that they can not be bought directly, but they often require investment in the\nform of time spent on public and media relations. Favorable press mentions, hot viral videos, and\nfeatured App Store placements are all effective ways to gain attention. Companies may be lulled into\nthinking that related downloads or sales spikes signal long-term success, yet awareness generated by\nearned triggers can be short-lived.\nFor earned triggers to drive ongoing user acquisition, companies must keep their products in the\nlimelight — a difficult and unpredictable task.\n3. Relationship Triggers\nOne person telling others about a product or service can be a highly effective external trigger for\naction. Whether through an electronic invitation, a Facebook “Like,” or old fashioned word-of-mouth,\nproduct referrals from friends and family are often a key component of technology diffusion.\nRelationship triggers can create the viral hypergrowth entrepreneurs and investors lust after.\nSometimes relationship triggers drive growth because people love to tell each other about a\nwonderful offer.\nFor example, it is hard to top PayPal’s viral success of the late 1990s.\n[xlv]\nPayPal knew that once\nusers started sending each other money online they would realize the tremendous value of the service.\nThe allure that someone just sent you money was a huge incentive to open an account, and PayPal’s\ngrowth spread because it was both viral and useful.\nUnfortunately, some companies utilize viral loops and relationship triggers in unethical ways by\ndeploying so-called “dark patterns.” When designers intentionally trick users into inviting friends or\nblasting a message to their social networks, they may see some initial growth, but it comes at the\nexpense of the social currency of users, including their goodwill and trust. When people discover\nthey’ve been duped, they vent their frustration and stop using the product.\nProper use of relationship triggers requires building an engaged user base that is enthusiastic about\nsharing the benefits of the product with others.\n4. Owned Triggers\nOwned triggers consume a piece of real-estate in the user’s environment. They consistently show up\nin daily life and it is ultimately up to the user to opt into allowing these triggers to appear.\nFor example, an app icon on the user’s phone screen, an email newsletter to which the user\nsubscribes, or an app update notification only appear if the user wants it there. As long as the user\nagrees to receive a trigger, the company that sets the trigger owns a share of the user’s attention.\nOwned triggers are only set after users sign up for an account, submit their email address, install an\napp, opt into newsletters, or otherwise indicate they want to continue receiving communications.\nWhile paid, earned, and relationship triggers drive new user acquisition, owned triggers prompt\nrepeat engagement until a habit is formed. Without owned triggers and users’ tacit permission to enter\ntheir attentional space, it is difficult to cue users frequently enough to change their behavior.\n***\nBut external triggers are only the first step. The ultimate goal of all external triggers is to propel users\ninto and through the Hook Model so that, after successive cycles, they do not need further prompting\nfrom external triggers. When users form habits, they are cued by a different kind of trigger: internal\ntriggers.\nInternal Triggers\nWhen a product becomes tightly coupled with a thought, an emotion, or a pre-existing routine, it\nleverages an internal trigger. Unlike external triggers, which use sensory stimuli like a morning alarm\nclock or giant “Log-In Now” button, you can’t see, touch, or hear an internal trigger. Internal triggers\nmanifest automatically in your mind. Connecting internal triggers with a product is the brass ring of\nconsumer technology.\nFor Yin, the young woman with the Instagram habit, her favorite photo app manufactured a\npredictable response cued by an internal trigger. Through repeated conditioning, a connection was\nformed between Yin’s need to capture images of the things around her and the app on her ever-present\nmobile device.\nEmotions, particularly negative ones, are powerful internal triggers and greatly influence our daily\nroutines. Feelings of boredom, loneliness, frustration, confusion, and indecisiveness often instigate a\nslight pain or irritation and prompt an almost instantaneous and often mindless action to quell the\nnegative sensation. For instance, Yin often uses Instagram when she fears a special moment will be\nlost forever.\nThe severity of the discomfort may be relatively minor — perhaps her fear is below the\nperceptibility of consciousness — but that’s exactly the point. Our life is filled with tiny stressors and\nwe’re usually unaware of our habitual reactions to these nagging issues.\nPositive emotions can also serve as internal triggers, and may even be triggered themselves by a\nneed to satisfy something that is bothering us. After all, we use products to find solutions to problems.\nThe desire to be entertained can be thought of as the need to satiate boredom. A need to share good\nnews can also be thought of as an attempt to find and maintain social connections.\nAs product designers, it is our goal to solve these problems and eliminate pain — to scratch the\nuser’s itch. Users who find a product that alleviates their pain will form strong, positive associations\nwith the product over time. After continued use, bonds begin to form — like the layers of nacre in an\noyster — between the product and the user whose need it satisfies. Gradually, these bonds cement\ninto a habit as users turn to your product when experiencing certain internal triggers.\nA study at the Missouri University of Science and Technology illustrates how tech solutions can\nprovide frequent psychological relief.\n[xlvi]\nIn 2011, a group of 216 undergraduates volunteered to have\ntheir Internet activity anonymously tracked. Over the course of the academic year, the researchers\nmeasured the frequency with which these students used the web and what they were doing online.\nAt the end of the study, the researchers compared anonymized data of students who visited the\nuniversity’s health services to treat symptoms of depression. “We identified several features of\nInternet usage that correlated with depression,” wrote Sriram Chellappan, one of the study’s\nauthors.\n[xlvii]\n“For example, participants with depressive symptoms tended to engage in very high email\nusage…Other characteristic features of depressive Internet behavior included increased amounts of\nvideo watching, gaming, and chatting.”\nThe study demonstrated that people suffering from symptoms of depression used the Internet more.\nWhy is that? One hypothesis is that those with depression experience negative emotions more\nfrequently than the general population and seek relief by turning to technology to lift their mood.\nConsider, perhaps, your own emotion-cued behaviors. What do you do in response to your internal\ntriggers?\nWhen bored, many people seek excitement and turn to dramatic news headlines. When we feel\noverly stressed we seek calm, perhaps finding relief in sites like Pinterest. When we feel lonely,\ndestinations like Facebook and Twitter provide instant social connections.\nTo ameliorate the sensation of uncertainty, Google is just a click away. Email, perhaps the mother\nof all habit-forming technology, is a go-to solution for many of our daily agitations, from validating\nour importance (or even, simply our existence) by checking to see if someone needs us, to providing\nan escape from life's more mundane moments.\nOnce hooked, using these products does not always require an explicit call-to-action. Instead, they\nrely upon our automatic responses to feelings that precipitate the desired behavior. Products that\nattach to these internal triggers provide users with quick relief. Once a technology has created an\nassociation in users’ minds that the product is the solution of choice, they return on their own, no\nlonger needing prompts from external triggers.\nIn the case of internal triggers, the information about what to do next is encoded as a learned\nassociation in the user’s memory.\nBut the association between an internal trigger and your product is not formed overnight. It can take\nweeks or months of frequent usage for internal triggers to latch onto cues. New habits are sparked by\nexternal triggers, but associations with internal triggers are what keeps users hooked.\nAs Yin said, “I just use it whenever I see something cool.” By thoughtfully moving users from\nexternal to internal triggers, Instagram designed a persistent routine in people’s lives. A need is\ntriggered in Yin’s mind every time a moment is worth holding onto, and for her, the immediate\nsolution is Instagram. Yin no longer requires an external stimulus to prompt her to use the app — the\ninternal trigger happens on its own.\nBuilding for Triggers\nProducts that successfully create habits soothe the user’s pain by laying claim to a particular feeling.\nTo do so, product designers must know their user's internal triggers — that is, the pain they seek to\nsolve. But finding customers’ internal triggers requires learning more about people than what they can\ntell you in a survey. It requires digging deeper to understand how your users feel.\nThe ultimate goal of a habit-forming product is to solve the user’s pain by creating an association\nso that the user identifies the company’s product or service as the source of relief.\nFirst, the company must identify the particular frustration or pain-point in emotional terms, rather\nthan product features. But how does a designer go about uncovering the source of a user’s pain? The\nbest place to start is to learn the drivers behind successful habit-forming products — not to copy\nthem, but to understand how they solve users’ problems. Doing so will give you practice in diving\ndeeper into the mind of the consumer and alert you to common human needs and desires.\nAs Evan Williams, co-founder of Blogger and Twitter said, the Internet is, “a giant machine\ndesigned to give people what they want.”\n[xlviii] Williams continued, “We often think the Internet enables\nyou to do new things … But people just want to do the same things they’ve always done.”\nThese common needs are timeless and universal. But talking to users to reveal these wants will\nlikely prove ineffective since they themselves don’t know which emotions motivate them. People just\ndon’t think in these terms. You’ll often find that people’s “declared preferences” — what they say\nthey want — are far different from their “revealed preferences” — what they actually do.\nAs Erika Hall, author of Just Enough Research writes, “When the research focuses on what\npeople actually do (watch cat videos) rather than what they wish they did (produce cinema-quality\nhome movies) it actually expands possibilities.”\n[xlix] Looking for discrepancies exposes opportunities.\nWhy do people really send SMS messages? Why do they take photos? What role does watching\ntelevision or sports play in their lives? Ask yourself what pain these habits solve and what the user\nmight be feeling right before one of these actions.\nWhat would your user want to achieve by using your solution? Where and when will they use it?\nWhat emotions influence their use and will trigger them to action?\nJack Dorsey, co-founder of Twitter and Square, shared how his companies answer these important\nquestions, “[If] you want to build a product that is relevant to folks, you need to put yourself in their\nshoes and you need to write a story from their side. So, we spend a lot of time writing what's called\nuser narratives.”\n[l]\nDorsey goes on to describe how he tries to truly understand his user, “He is in the middle of\nChicago and they go to a coffee store ... This is the experience they're going to have. It reads like a\nplay. It's really, really beautiful. If you do that story well, then all of the prioritization, all of the\nproduct, all of the design and all the coordination that you need to do with these products just falls out\nnaturally because you can edit the story and everyone can relate to the story from all levels of the\norganization, engineers to operations to support to designers to the business side of the house.”\nDorsey believes a clear description of users — their desires, emotions, the context with which they\nuse the product — is paramount to building the right solution. In addition to Dorsey's user narratives,\ntools like customer development,\n[li]\nusability studies, and empathy maps\n[lii]\nare examples of methods for\nlearning about potential users.\nOne method is to try asking the question \"why\" as many times as it takes to get to an emotion.\nUsually this will happen by the fifth “why.” This is a technique adapted from the Toyota Production\nSystem described by Taiichi Ohno as the “5 Whys Method.” Ohno wrote that it was \"the basis of\nToyota's scientific approach ... by repeating ‘why?’ five times, the nature of the problem as well as\nits solution becomes clear.\"\n[liii]\nWhen it comes to figuring out why people use habit-forming products, internal triggers are the root\ncause, and “why?” is a question that can help drill right to the core.\nFor example, let's say we're building a fancy new technology called email for the first time. The\ntarget user is a busy middle manager named Julie. We've built a detailed narrative of our user, Julie,\nthat helps us answer the following series of \"whys:\"\nWhy #1: Why would Julie want to use email?\nAnswer: So she can send and receive messages.\nWhy #2: Why would she want to do that?\nAnswer: Because she wants to share and receive information quickly.\nWhy #3: Why does she want to do that?\nAnswer: To know what’s going on in the lives of her co-workers, friends, and family.\nWhy #4: Why does she need to know that?\nAnswer: To know if someone needs her.\nWhy #5: Why would she care about that?\nAnswer: She fears being out of the loop.\nNow we've got something! Fear is a powerful internal trigger and we can design our solution to\nhelp calm Julie’s fear. Of course, we might have come to another conclusion by starting with a\ndifferent persona, varying the narrative or coming up with different hypothetical answers along the\nchain of \"whys.” Only an accurate understanding of our user's underlying needs can inform the\nproduct requirements.\nBut now that we have an understanding of the user’s pain, we can move on to the next step of\ntesting our product to see if it solves her problem.\nUnpacking Instagram’s Triggers\nA large component of Instagram’s success — and what brings its millions of users back nearly\nevery day — is the company’s ability to understand its users’ triggers. For people like Yin, Instagram\nis a harbor for emotions and inspirations, a virtual memoir preserved in pixels.\nYin’s habitual use of the service started with an external trigger - a recommendation from a friend\nand weeks of repetitious use before she became a regular user.\nEvery time Yin snaps a picture, she shares it with her friends on Facebook and Twitter. Consider\nthe first time you saw an Instagram photo. Did it catch your attention? Did it make you curious? Did it\ncall you to action?\nThese photos serve as a relationship external trigger, raising awareness and serving as a cue for\nothers to install and use the app. But Instagram photos shared on Facebook and Twitter were not the\nonly external triggers driving new users. Others learned of the app from the media and bloggers, or\nthrough the featured placement Apple granted Instagram in the App Store — all earned external\ntriggers.\nOnce installed, Instagram benefited from owned external triggers. The app icon on users’ phone\nscreens and push notifications about their friends’ postings served to call them back.\nWith repeated use, Instagram formed strong associations with internal triggers, and what was once\na brief distraction became an intraday routine for many users.\nIt is the fear of losing a special moment that instigates a pang of stress. This negative emotion is the\ninternal trigger that brings Instagram users back to the app to alleviate this pain by capturing a photo.\nAs users continue to use the service, new internal triggers form.\nBut Instagram is more than a camera replacement, it is a social network. The app helps users dispel\nboredom by connecting them with others, sharing photos, and swapping lighthearted banter.\n[liv]\nLike many social networking sites, Instagram also alleviates the increasingly recognizable “pain”\nknown as “fear of missing out,” or FOMO. For Instagram, associations with internal triggers provide\na foundation to form new habits.\nNow it is time to understand the mechanics of connecting the user’s problem with your solution by\nutilizing the next step in the Hook Model. In the next chapter, we’ll find out how moving people from\ntriggers to actions is critical in establishing new routines.\n***\nRemember and Share\n- Triggers cue the user to take action and are the first step in the Hook Model.\n- Triggers come in two types — external and internal.\n- External triggers tell the user what to do next by placing information within the user’s\nenvironment.\n- Internal triggers tell the user what to do next through associations stored in the user’s\nmemory.\n- Negative emotions frequently serve as internal triggers.\n- To build a habit-forming product, makers need to understand which user emotions may be tied\nto internal triggers and know how to leverage external triggers to drive the user to action.\n***\nDo This Now\nRefer to the answers you came up with in the last “Do This Now” section to complete the following\nexercises:\n- Who is your product’s user?\n- What is the user doing right before your intended habit?\n- Come up with three internal triggers that could cue your user to action. Refer to the “5 Whys\nMethod” described in this chapter.\n- Which internal trigger does your user experience most frequently?\n- Finish this brief narrative using the most frequent internal trigger and the habit you are\ndesigning:\n“Every time the user (internal trigger), he/she (first action of intended habit).”\n- Refer back to the question about what the user is doing right before the first action of the\nhabit. What might be places and times to send an external trigger?\n- How can you couple an external trigger as closely as possible to when the user’s internal\ntrigger fires?\n- Think of at least three conventional ways to trigger your user with current technology (emails,\nnotifications, text messages, etc.). Then stretch yourself to come up with at least three crazy, or\ncurrently impossible, ideas for ways to trigger your user (wearable computers, biometric sensors,\ncarrier pigeons, etc.). You may find that your crazy ideas spur some new approaches, which may\nnot be so crazy after all. In a few years, new technologies will create all sorts of currently\nunimaginable triggering opportunities.\n\n\n3. ACTION\nThe next step in The Hook is the action phase. The trigger, driven by internal or external cues,\ninforms the user of what to do next; however, if the user does not take action, the trigger is useless. To\ninitiate action, doing must be easier than thinking. Remember, a habit is a behavior done with little or\nno conscious thought. The more effort — either physical or mental — required to perform the desired\naction, the less likely it is to occur.\nAction vs. Inaction\nIf action is paramount to habit-formation, how can a product designer influence users to act? Is there a\nformula for behavior? It turns out there is.\nWhile there are many theories about what drives human behaviors, Dr. BJ Fogg, Director of the\nPersuasive Technology Lab at Stanford University, has developed a model that serves as a relatively\nsimple way to understand what drives our actions.\nFogg posits that there are three ingredients required to initiate any and all behaviors: (1) the user\nmust have sufficient motivation; (2) the user must have the ability to complete the desired action; and\n(3) a trigger must be present to activate the behavior.\nThe Fogg Behavior Model is represented in a formula, B = MAT, which represents that a given\nbehavior will occur when motivation, ability, and a trigger are present at the same time and in\nsufficient degrees.\n[lv]\nIf any component of this formula is missing or inadequate, the user will not cross\nthe “Action Line” and the behavior will not occur.\nLet’s walk through an example Fogg uses to explain his model. Imagine a time when your mobile\nphone rang but you didn’t answer it. Why not?\nPerhaps the phone was buried in a bag, making it difficult to reach. In this case your inability to\neasily answer the call inhibited the action. Your ability was limited.\nMaybe you thought the caller was a telemarketer, someone you did not want to speak to. So, your\nlack of motivation influenced you to ignore the call.\nOr, maybe the call was important and within arm’s reach, but the ringer on your phone was\nsilenced. Despite having both a strong motivation and easy access to answer the call, it was\ncompletely missed because you never heard it ring — in other words, no trigger was present.\nIn the previous chapter, we covered triggers, so now let’s dive deeper into the other two\ncomponents of the Fogg Behavior Model: motivation and ability.\nMotivation\nWhile a trigger cues an action, motivation defines the level of desire to take that action. Dr. Edward\nDeci, Professor of Psychology at the University of Rochester and a leading researcher on SelfDetermination Theory, defines motivation as, \"the energy for action.\"\n[lvi]\nWhile the nature of motivation is a widely contested topic in psychology, Fogg argues that three\nCore Motivators drive our desire to act.\nFogg states that all humans are motivated to seek pleasure and avoid pain, to seek hope and avoid\nfear, and finally, to seek social acceptance and avoid rejection. The two sides of the three Core\nMotivators can be thought of as levers to increase or decrease the likelihood of a person taking a\nparticular action by increasing or decreasing their motivation.\nMotivation Examples in Advertising\nPerhaps no industry makes the elements of motivation more explicit than the advertising business.\nAdvertisers regularly tap into people’s motivations to influence their habits. By looking at ads with a\ncritical eye, we can identify how they attempt to influence our actions.\nFor example, Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign leveraged a deeply inspiring message\nand image during a time of economic and political upheaval. An iconic poster designed by artist\nShepard Fairey conveyed the idea of “hope,” not only with the word printed in bold letters along the\nbottom of the image, but also through Obama’s steadfast gaze as he looked confidently toward the\nfuture. (Unfortunately, the image was at the center of a copyright battle between Fairey and the\nAssociated Press, which claimed ownership of the original photograph used in the artwork, so I’ve\nchosen to not to include it here. If you can’t recall the image, there is a link in the endnotes).\n[lvii]\nAnother example of motivation in advertising relates to the old saying, “sex sells.” Long an\nadvertising standard, images of buff, scantily clad (and usually female) bodies are used to hawk\neverything from the latest Victoria’s Secret lingerie to domain names through GoDaddy.com and fast\nfood chains such as Carl’s Jr. and Burger King (figure 4). These and countless others use the\nvoyeuristic promise of pleasure to capture attention and motivate action.\nFigure 4\nOf course, this strategy only appeals to a particular demographic's association with sex as a salient\nmotivator. While teenage boys — the common target for these ads — may find them inspiring, others\nmay find them distasteful. What motivates some people will not motivate others, a fact that provides\nall the more reason to understand the needs of your particular target audience.\nSometimes the psychological motivator is not as obvious as those used by Obama supporters or\nfast food chains. The Budweiser ad in figure 5 illustrates how the beer company uses the motivator of\nsocial cohesion by displaying three “buds,” cheering for their national team. Although beer is not\ndirectly related to social acceptance, the ad reinforces the association that the brand goes together\nwith good friends and good times.\nFigure 5\nOn the flip-side, negative emotions such as fear can also be powerful motivators. The ad in figure\n6 shows a disabled man with a shocking head scar. The ad is impactful, communicating the risks of\nnot wearing a motorcycle helmet. The words, \"I won't wear a helmet it makes me look stupid,\" along\nwith the patient’s mental age (post-motorcycle accident) of two-years old, send a chilling message.\nFigure 6\nAs described in the previous chapter on triggers, understanding why the user needs your product or\nservice is critical. While internal triggers are the frequent itch experienced by users throughout their\ndays, the right motivators create action by offering the promise of desirable outcomes (i.e., a\nsatisfying scratch).\nHowever, even with the right trigger enabled and motivation running high, product designers often\nfind users still don’t behave the way they want them to. What’s missing in this equation? Usability, or\nrather, the ability of the user to take action easily.\nAbility\nIn his book, Something Really New: Three Simple Steps to Creating Truly Innovative Products\n[lviii]\n,\nauthor Denis J. Hauptly deconstructs the process of innovation into its most fundamental steps. First,\nHauptly says, understand the reason people use a product or service. Next, lay out the steps the\ncustomer must take to get the job done. Finally, once the series of tasks from intention to outcome is\nunderstood, simply start removing steps until you reach the simplest possible process.\nConsequently, any technology or product that significantly reduces the steps to complete a task will\nenjoy high adoption rates by the people it assists. For Hauptly, easier equals better.\nBut can the nature of innovation be explained so succinctly? Perhaps a brief detour into the\ntechnology of the recent past will illustrate the point.\nA few decades ago, a dial-up Internet connection seemed magical. All users had to do was boot-up\ntheir computers, hit a few keys on their desktop keyboards, wait for their modems to screech and\nscream as they established connections, and then, perhaps 30 seconds to a minute later, they were\nonline. Checking email or browsing the nascent World Wide Web was terribly slow (by today’s\nstandards), but offered unprecedented convenience compared to finding information any other way.\nThe technology was remarkable and soon became a ritual for millions of people accessing this new\nmarvel known as the Internet.\nOf course, today few of us could stand the torture of using a 2400 baud modem after we’ve become\naccustomed to our always-on, high-speed Internet connections. Emails are now instantaneously\npushed to the devices in our pockets. Our photos, music, videos, and files — not to mention the\nvastness of the open web — are accessible almost anywhere, anytime, on any connected device.\nIn line with Hauptly’s assertion, as the steps required to get something done (in this case, to get\nonline and use the Internet) were removed or improved upon, adoption increased.\nFor example, consider the trend-line of the relationship between the percentage of people creating\ncontent online and the increasing ease of doing so, as shown in figure 7.\nFigure 7\nWeb 1.0 was categorized by a few content providers like C|net (now called CNET) or the New\nYork Times publishing to the masses, with only a tiny number of people creating what others read.\nBut in the late 1990s, blogging changed the web. Before blogging, amateur writers had to purchase\ntheir own domain, fiddle with DNS settings, find a web host, and set up a content-management systemto present their writing. Suddenly, new companies like Blogger eliminated most of these steps by\nallowing users to simply register an account and start posting.\nEvan Williams, who co-founded Blogger and later Twitter, echoes Hauptly’s formula for\ninnovation when he describes his own approach to building two massively successful companies.\n[lix]\n“Take a human desire, preferably one that has been around for a really long time… Identify that\ndesire and use modern technology to take out steps.” Blogger made posting content online\ndramatically easier. The result? The percentage of users creating content online, as opposed to simply\nconsuming it, increased.\nAlong came Facebook and other social media tools, refining earlier innovations such as Bulletin\nBoard Systems (BBS) and Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feeds into tools for status update-hungry\nusers.\nThen, seven years after Blogger’s birth, a new company described at first as a “micro-blogging”\nservice sought to bring sharing to the masses — Twitter. For many, blogging was still too difficult\nand time-consuming. But anyone could type short, casual messages. “Tweeting” began to enter the\nnational lexicon as Twitter gained wider adoption, climbing to 500 million registered users by\n2012.\n[lx] Critics first discounted Twitter’s 140-character message limitation as gimmicky and\nrestrictive. But little did they realize the constraint actually increased users’ ability to create. A few\nkeyboard taps and users were sharing. As of late 2013, 340 million tweets were sent every day.\nMore recently, companies such as Pinterest, Instagram and Vine have elevated online content\ncreation to a new level of simplicity. Now, just a quick snap of a photo or re-pin of an interesting\nimage shares information across multiple social networks. The pattern of innovation shows that\nmaking a given action easier to accomplish spurs each successive phase of the web, helping to turn\nthe once-niche behavior of content publishing into a mainstream habit.\nAs recent history of the web demonstrates, the ease or difficulty of doing a particular action\nimpacts the likelihood that a behavior will occur. To successfully simplify a product, we must\nremove obstacles that stand in the user’s way. According to the Fogg Behavior Model, ability is the\ncapacity to do a particular behavior.\n***\nFogg describes six “elements of simplicity” — the factors that influence a task’s difficulty.\n[lxi] These\nare:\n- Time - How long it takes to complete an action.\n- Money - The fiscal cost of taking an action.\n- Physical Effort - The amount of labor involved in taking the action.\n- Brain Cycles - The level of mental effort and focus required to take an action.\n- Social Deviance - How accepted the behavior is by others.\n- Non-Routine - According to Fogg, “How much the action matches or disrupts existing routines.”\nTo increase the likelihood of a behavior occurring, Fogg instructs designers to focus on simplicity as\na function of the user's scarcest resource at that moment. In other words, identify what the user is\nmissing. What is making it difficult for the user to accomplish the desired action?\nIs the user short on time? Is the behavior too expensive? Is the user exhausted after a long day of\nwork? Is the product too difficult to understand? Is the user in a social context where the behavior\ncould be perceived as inappropriate? Is the behavior simply so far outside of the user’s normal\nroutine that its strangeness is off-putting?\nThese factors will differ by person and context, so designers should ask, \"What is the thing that is\nmissing that would allow my users to proceed to the next step?\" Designing with an eye toward\nsimplifying the overall user experience reduces friction, removes obstacles, and helps push the user\nacross Fogg’s action line.\nThe action phase of the Hook Model incorporates Fogg’s six elements of simplicity by asking\ndesigners to consider how their technology can facilitate the simplest actions in anticipation of\nreward. The easier an action, the more likely the user is to do it and to continue the cycle through the\nnext phase of the Hook Model.\nBelow are examples of simple online interfaces used by a number of successful companies to\nprompt users to move quickly into the Hook’s next phase.\nLogging In with Facebook\nTraditionally, registering for a new account with an app or website requires several steps. The user\nis prompted to enter an email address, create a password, and submit other information such as a\nname or phone number. This burden introduces significant friction, detracting users from signing-up.\nMobile devices present the special challenge of smaller screens and slower typing speeds.\nHowever, today it is nearly impossible to browse the web or use a mobile app without\nencountering a Facebook Login prompt (figure 8). Many companies have eliminated several steps in\nthe registration process by enabling users to register with their sites by using their existing Facebook\ncredentials.\nFigure 8\nWhile the Facebook login function is useful for time-starved people, it should be noted that for\nothers, the tool doesn’t necessarily ease registration. For example, users who are wary of how\nFacebook might share their personal information may not find the login button helpful because it may\ntrigger new anxieties (and thus, brain cycles) about the social networking giant’s trustworthiness.\nAgain, the roadblocks confronting users vary by person and context. There is no one-size-fits-all\nsolution, so designers should seek to understand an array of possible user challenges.\nSharing with the Twitter Button\nTwitter helps people share articles, videos, photos or any other content they find on the web. The\ncompany noticed that 25 percent of tweets contained a link and therefore sought to make the action of\ntweeting a website link as easy as possible.\n[lxii]\nTo ease the way for link-sharers, Twitter created an embeddable Tweet button for third-party sites,\nallowing them to offer visitors a one-click way to tweet directly from their pages (figure 9). The\nexternal trigger opens a preset message, reducing the cognitive effort of composing the tweet and\nsaving several steps to sharing.\nFigure 9\nSearching with Google\nGoogle, the world’s most popular search engine, was not the first to market. It competed against\nincumbents such as Yahoo!, Lycos, AltaVista, and Excite when it launched in the late 1990s. How did\nGoogle come to dominate the multi-billion dollar industry?\nFor one, Google’s PageRank algorithm proved to be a much more effective way to index the web.\nBy ranking pages based on how frequently other sites linked to them, Google improved search\nrelevancy. Compared with directory-based search tools such as Yahoo!, Google was a massive timesaver. But Google also beat out other search engines that had become polluted with irrelevant content\nand cluttered with advertising (figure 10). From its inception, Google’s clean and simple homepage\nand search results pages were solely focused on streamlining the act of searching and getting relevant\nresults (figure 11).\nFigure 10 - The Yahoo homepage circa 1998\nFigure 11 - The Google homepage circa 1998\nSimply put, Google reduced the amount of time and the cognitive effort required to find what the\nuser was looking for. The company continues to relentlessly improve its search engine by finding new\nways to remove whatever might be in the user’s way — no matter how seemingly trivial. While its\nhomepage remains remarkably pristine, Google now offers myriad tools to make searching easier and\nfaster — including automatic spelling correction, predictive results based on partial queries, and\nsearch results that load even as the user is typing. Google’s efforts are intended to make searching\neasier to keep users coming back.\nTaking Photos with the Apple iPhone\nMany of life’s most treasured moments come and go in an instant. We try and capture these memories\nin photos, but if our camera is out of reach or too cumbersome to catch the shot, we lose those\nmoments forever. Apple recognized it could help iPhone owners take more photos by making picturetaking easier. The company made the camera app directly launchable from the locked screen, without\nrequiring a password. Compared to the number of steps needed to access photo apps on other\nsmartphones, the simple flick gesture of the native iPhone camera gives it a virtual monopoly as\nusers’ go-to solution whenever they need to snap a quick pic (figure 12).\nFigure 12\nScrolling with Pinterest\nHow can a website make browsing easier? One solution popularized by digital pinboard site,\nPinterest, is the infinite scroll. In the past, getting from one web page to the next required clicking and\nwaiting. However on sites such as Pinterest, whenever the user nears the bottom of a page, more\nresults automatically load. Users never have to pause as they continue scrolling through pins or posts\nwithout end (figure 13).\nFigure 13\n***\nThe examples above show how simplicity increases the intended user behaviors.\nMotivation or Ability — Which Should You Increase First?\nAfter uncovering the triggers that prompt user actions and deciding which actions you want to turn\ninto habits, you can increase motivation and ability to spark the likelihood of your users taking a\ndesired behavior. But which should you invest in first, motivation or ability? Where is your time and\nmoney better spent?\nThe answer is always to start with ability.\nOf course, all three parts of B=MAT must be present for a singular user action to occur; without a\nclear trigger and sufficient motivation, there will be no behavior. But for companies building\ntechnology solutions, the greatest return on investment will generally come from increasing a\nproduct’s ease-of-use.\nThe fact is, increasing motivation is expensive and time-consuming. Website visitors tend to ignore\ninstructional text. Their attention is split on several tasks at once and they have little patience for\nexplanations about why or how they should do something. Instead, influencing behavior by reducing\nthe effort required to perform an action is more effective than increasing someone’s desire to do it.\nMake your product so simple that users already know how to use it, and you’ve got a winner.\nThe Evolution of Twitter’s Homepage\nIn 2009, the Twitter homepage was cluttered with text and dozens of links (figure 14). The page was\nconfusing, especially for new users unfamiliar with the product. Twitter’s value proposition of\nsharing what you were doing with friends and family failed to resonate with most users, who\nwondered, \"why would I want to broadcast my activities?\" The page design demanded a high level of\nattention and comprehension.\nFigure 14 - The Twitter homepage in 2009\nA year later, Twitter redesigned its homepage, touting itself as a service to “share and discover\nwhat’s happening” (figure 15). Although the page became more focused on action, it was still visually\nonerous. Even more unfortunate, the task users were most likely to do — search — was not what\nTwitter really wanted them to do. Twitter management knew from early users that those who\nfollowed other people on the service were more likely to stay engaged and form a habit. But\nsearching on Twitter was not helping that goal, so the company decided to make another switch.\nFigure 15 - The Twitter homepage in 2010\nDuring the company’s period of hypergrowth, the Twitter homepage became radically more simple\n(figure 16). The product description is itself only 140 characters long and has evolved from the\ncognitively difficult request that users broadcast their information (as seen in 2009), to the less taxing\n“Find out what’s happening, right now, with the people and organizations you care about.”\nFigure 16 - The Twitter homepage in 2012\nThe big bold image of people looking into some kind of light-emanating event, like a concert or a\nsoccer match, metaphorically communicates the value of the service while piquing curiosity. Most\nstrikingly, the page has two very clear calls-to-action: sign in or sign up. The company made the\ndesired action as simple as possible, knowing that getting users to experience the service would yield\nbetter results than trying to convince them to use it while still on the homepage.\nOf course, it is worth noting that Twitter was in a different place in 2012 than in 2009. People\ncame to the site having heard more about the service as its popularity grew. Twitter’s homepage\nevolution reveals how the company discovered its users’ scarcest resource. In 2009, the Twitter\nhomepage attempted to boost motivation. But by 2012, Twitter had discovered that no matter how\nmuch users knew about the service, driving them to open an account and start following people\nresulted in much higher engagement.\nRecently, Twitter’s homepage has been modified slightly to encourage downloading of the\ncompany’s mobile apps (figure 17). The simplicity of the large sign-in or sign-up triggers on the 2012\nversion remain, but Twitter now knows that driving users to install the app on their phones leads to\nthe highest rates of repeat engagement.\nFigure 17 - The Twitter homepage in 2013\nOn Heuristics and Perception\nSo far, we have discussed Fogg’s Core Motivators and the six elements of simplicity as levers for\ninfluencing the likelihood of a particular behavior occurring. These factors echo ideals of how people\nreact when making rational decisions. For example, every Economics 101 student learns that as\nprices decrease, consumers purchase more — in Fogg’s terms, an example of increasing ability by\ndecreasing price.\nHowever, although the principle seems elementary, the law, like many other theories of human\nbehavior, has exceptions. The field of behavioral economics, as studied by luminaries such as Nobel\nPrize winner Daniel Kahneman, exposed exceptions to the rational model of human behavior. Even\nthe notion that people always consume more if something costs less, for example, is a tendency, not an\nabsolute.\nThere are many counterintuitive and surprising ways companies can boost users’ motivation or\nincrease their ability by understanding heuristics — the mental shortcuts we take to make decisions\nand form opinions. It is worth mentioning a few of these brain biases. Even though users are often\nunaware of these influences on their behavior, heuristics can predict their actions.\nThe Scarcity Effect\nIn 1975, researchers Worchel, Lee, and Adewole wanted to know how people would value cookies\nin two identical glass jars.\n[lxiii] One jar held ten cookies while the other contained just two stragglers.\nWhich cookies would people value more?\nWhile the cookies and jars were identical, participants valued the ones in the near-empty jar more\nhighly. The appearance of scarcity affected their perception of value.\nThere are many theories as to why this is the case. For one, scarcity may signal something about the\nproduct. If there are fewer of an item, the thinking goes, it might be because other people know\nsomething you don’t. Namely, that the cookies in the almost-empty jar are the better choice. The jar\nwith just two cookies left in it conveys valuable, albeit irrelevant, information since the cookies are\nidentical. Yet, the perception of scarcity changed their perceived value.\nIn the second part of their experiment, the researchers wanted to know what would happen to the\nperception of the value of the cookies if they suddenly became scarce or abundant. Groups of study\nparticipants were given jars with either two cookies or ten. Then, the people in the group with ten\ncookies suddenly had eight taken away. Conversely, those with only two cookies had eight new\ncookies added to their jars. How would these changes affect the way participants valued the cookies?\nResults remained consistent with the scarcity heuristic. The group left with only two cookies rated\nthem to be more valuable, while those experiencing sudden abundance by going from two to ten,\nactually valued the cookies less. In fact, they valued the cookies even lower than people who had\nstarted with ten cookies to begin with. The study showed that a product can decrease in perceived\nvalue if it starts off as scarce and becomes abundant.\nFor an example of how perception of a limited supply can increase sales, look no further than\nAmazon.com. My recent search for a DVD revealed there were “only 14 left in stock” (figure 18),\nwhile a search for a book I’ve had my eye on says only three copies remain. Is the world’s largest\nonline retailer almost sold out of nearly everything I want to buy or are they using the scarcity\nheuristic to influence my buying behavior?\nFigure 18 - “Only 14 left in stock”?\nThe Framing Effect\nContext also shapes perception. In a social experiment, world-class violinist Joshua Bell decided to\nplay a free impromptu concert in a Washington, DC subway station.\n[lxiv] Bell regularly sells out venues\nsuch as the Kennedy Center and Carnegie Hall for hundreds of dollars per ticket, but when placed in\nthe context of the DC subway, his music fell upon deaf ears. Almost nobody knew they were walking\npast one of the most talented musicians in the world.\nThe mind takes shortcuts informed by our surroundings to make quick and sometimes erroneous\njudgments. When Bell performed his concert in the subway station, few stopped to listen. But when\nframed in the context of a concert hall, he can charge beaucoup bucks.\nBut the framing heuristic not only influences our behaviors — it literally changes how our brain\nperceives pleasure. For example, a 2007 study attempted to measure if price had any influence on the\ntaste of wine.\n[lxv] The researchers had study participants sample wine while in an fMRI machine.\nAs the machine scanned the blood flow in the various regions of their brains, the tasters were\ninformed of the cost of each wine sampled. The sample started with a $5 wine and progressed to a\n$90 bottle. Interestingly, as the price of the wine increased, so did the participant's enjoyment of the\nwine. Not only did they say they enjoyed the wine more but their brain corroborated their feelings,\nshowing higher spikes in the regions associated with pleasure. Little did the study participants\nrealize, they were tasting the same wine each time. This study demonstrates how perception can forma personal reality based on how a product is framed, even when there is little relationship with\nobjective quality.\nThe Anchoring Effect\nRarely can you walk into a clothing store without seeing signage for “30% off,” “buy-one-get-one\nfree,” and other sales and deals. In reality, these items are often marketed to maximize profits for the\nbusiness. Often, the same store will have similar but less expensive (yet non-discounted) products. I\nrecently visited a store that offered a package of three Jockey brand undershirts at a buy-one-get-onehalf-off discount for $29.50. After surveying other options, I noticed a package of five Fruit of the\nLoom brand undershirts selling for $34. After some quick math, I discovered that the shirts not on sale\nwere actually cheaper per-shirt than the “discounted” brand’s package.\nPeople often anchor to one piece of information when making a decision. I almost bought the shirts\non sale assuming that the one feature differentiating the two brands — the fact that one was on sale\nand the other was not — was all I needed to consider.\nThe Endowed Progress Effect\nPunch cards are often used by retailers to encourage repeat business. With each purchase, customers\nget closer to receiving a free product or service. These cards are typically awarded empty and in\neffect, customers start at zero percent complete. What would happen if retailers handed customers\npunch cards with punches already given? Would people be more likely to take action if they had\nalready made some progress? An experiment sought to answer this very question.\n[lxvi]\nTwo groups of customers were given punch cards awarding a free car wash once the cards were\nfully punched. One group was given a blank punch card with 8 squares and the other given a punch\ncard with 10 squares but with two free punches. Both groups still had to purchase 8 car washes to\nreceive a free wash; however, the second group of customers — those that were given two free\npunches — had a staggering 82 percent higher completion rate. The study demonstrates the endowed\nprogress effect, a phenomenon that increases motivation as people believe they are nearing a goal.\nSites such as LinkedIn and Facebook utilize this heuristic to encourage people to divulge more\ninformation about themselves when completing their online profiles. On LinkedIn, every user starts\nwith some semblance of progress (figure 19). The next step is to “Improve Your Profile Strength” by\nsupplying additional information. As users complete each step, the meter incrementally shows the\nuser is advancing. Cleverly, LinkedIn’s completion bar jumpstarts the perception of progress and\ndoes not include a numeric scale. For the new user, a proper LinkedIn profile does not seem so far\naway. But even the “advanced” user still has additional steps she can take to inch toward the final\ngoal.\nFigure 19\n***\nMost people remain unaware of how heuristics help us make split-second decisions multiple times\nper day. Psychologists believe there are hundreds of cognitive biases that influence our behaviors and\nthe four discussed here are just a few examples.\n[lxvii]\nFor product designers building habit-forming\ntechnology, understanding and leveraging these methods for boosting motivation and ability can prove\nhighly impactful.\nStephen Anderson, author of Seductive Interaction Design, created a tool called Mental Notes to\nhelp designers build better products through heuristics.\n[lxviii] Each of the cards in his deck of 50 contains\na brief description of a cognitive bias and is intended to spark product team conversations around\nhow they might utilize the principle. For example, team members might ask themselves how they\ncould utilize the endowed progress effect or the scarcity effect to increase the likelihood of a desired\nuser behavior.\nIn this chapter, we discovered how to take users from trigger to action. We discussed how\ncognitive biases influence behavior and how by designing the simplest action in anticipation of a\nreward, product makers can advance users to the next phase of the Hook Model.\nNow that users have passed through the first two phases, it is time to give them what they came for\n— the reward that scratches their itch. But what is it exactly that users want? What keeps us coming\nback time and again to habit-forming experiences and technologies? The answer to what we’re all\nsearching for is the topic of the next chapter.\n***\nRemember and Share\n- Action is the second step in The Hook.\n- The action is the simplest behavior in anticipation of reward.\n- As described by the Dr. BJ Fogg’s Behavior Model:\n- For any behavior to occur, a trigger must be present at the same time as the user has suf icient\nability and motivation to take action.\n- To increase the desired behavior, ensure a clear trigger is present, then increase ability by\nmaking the action easier to do, and finally align with the right motivator.\n- Every behavior is driven by one of three Core Motivators: seeking pleasure or avoiding pain,\nseeking hope and avoiding fear, seeking social acceptance while avoiding social rejection.\n- Ability is influenced by the six factors of time, money, physical ef ort, brain cycles, social\ndeviance, and non-routineness. Ability is dependent on users and their context at that moment.\n- Heuristics are cognitive shortcuts we take to make quick decisions. Product designers can\nutilize many of the hundreds of heuristics to increase the likelihood of their desired action.\n***\nDo This Now\nRefer to the answers you came up with in the last “Do This Now” section to complete the following\nexercises:\n- Walk through the path your users would take to use your product or service, beginning from\nthe time they feel their internal trigger to the point where they receive their expected outcome.\nHow many steps does it take before users obtain the reward they came for? How does this process\ncompare with the simplicity of some of the examples described in this chapter? How does it\ncompare with competing products and services?\n- Which resources are limiting your users’ ability to accomplish the tasks that will become\nhabits?\n- Time\n- Money\n- Physical ef ort\n- Brain cycles (too confusing)\n- Social deviance (outside the norm)\n- Non-routine (too new)\n- Brainstorm three testable ways to make the intended tasks easier to complete.\n- Consider how you might apply heuristics to make habit-forming actions more likely.\n\n4. VARIABLE REWARD\nUltimately, all businesses help users achieve an objective. As we learned in the previous chapter,\nreducing the steps needed to complete the intended outcome increases the likelihood of that outcome.\nBut to keep users engaged, products need to deliver on their promises. To form the learned\nassociations we discussed in the chapter on triggers, users must come to depend on the product as a\nreliable solution to their problem — the salve for the itch they came to scratch.\nThe third step in the Hook Model is the Variable Reward phase. In this phase, you reward your\nusers by solving a problem, reinforcing their motivation for the action taken in the previous phase.\nBut to understand why rewards — and variable rewards in particular — are so powerful, we must\nfirst take a trip deep inside the brain.\nUnderstanding Rewards\nIn the 1940s, two researchers named James Olds and Peter Milner accidentally discovered how a\nspecial area of the brain is the source of our cravings. The researchers implanted electrodes in the\nbrains of lab mice that enabled the mice to give themselves tiny electric shocks to a small area of the\nbrain called the nucleus accumbens.\n[lxix] The mice quickly became hooked on the sensation.\nOlds and Milner demonstrated that the lab mice would forgo food, water, and even run across a\npainful electrified grid for the opportunity to continue pressing the lever that administered the shocks.\nA few years later, other researchers tested the human response to self-administered stimulus in the\nsame area of the brain. The results were just as dramatic as in the mouse trial — subjects wanted to\ndo nothing but press the brain-stimulating button. Even when the machine was turned off, people\ncontinued pressing the button. Researchers even had to forcibly take the devices from subjects who\nrefused to relinquish them.\nGiven the responses they had earlier demonstrated from lab animals, Olds and Milner concluded\nthat they had discovered the brain’s pleasure center. In fact, we now know other things that feel good\nalso activate the same neural region. Sex, delicious food, a bargain, and even our digital devices all\ntap into this deep recess of the brain, providing the impetus for many of our behaviors.\nHowever, more recent research has shown that Olds and Milner’s experiments were not\nstimulating pleasure per se. Stanford Professor Brian Knutson, conducted a study exploring blood\nflow in the brains of people wagering while inside of an fMRI machine.\n[lxx] The test subjects played a\ngambling game while Knutson and his team looked at which areas of their brains became more active.\nThe startling results showed that the nucleus accumbens was not activating when the reward (in this\ncase a monetary payout) was received, but rather, in anticipation of it.\nThe study revealed that what draws us to act is not the sensation we receive from the reward itself,\nbut the need to alleviate the craving for that reward. The stress of desire in the brain appears to\ncompel us, just as it did in Olds’ and Milner’s lab mouse experiments.\nUnderstanding Variability\nIf you’ve never watched a YouTube video of a baby’s first encounter with a dog, it’s worth doing.\nNot only are these videos incredibly cute, but they help demonstrate something important about our\nmental wiring.\nAt first, the expression on the baby’s face seems to ask, “What is this hairy monster doing in my\nhouse? Will it hurt me? What will it do next?” The child is filled with curiosity, uncertain if this\ncreature might cause harm. But soon the child figures out Rover is not a threat. What follows is an\nexplosion of infectious giggles. Researchers believe laughter may in fact be a release valve when we\nexperience the discomfort and excitement of uncertainty, but without fear of harm.\n[lxxi]\nWhat we do not see in the videos is what happens over time. A few years later, what was once\nthrilling about Rover, no longer holds the child’s attention in the same way. The child has learned to\npredict the dog’s behavior and no longer finds the pup quite as entertaining. By now, the child’s mind\nis occupied with dump trucks, fire engines, bicycles, and new toys that stimulate the senses — until\nthey too become predictable. Without variability, we are like children in that once we figure out what\nwill happen next, we become less excited by the experience. The same rules that apply to puppies\nalso apply to products. To hold our attention, products must have an ongoing degree of novelty.\nOur brains have evolved over millennia to help us figure out how things work. Once we understand\ncausal relationships, we retain that information in memory. Our habits are simply the brain's ability to\nquickly retrieve the appropriate behavioral response to a routine or process we have already learned.\nHabits help us conserve our attention for other things while we go about the tasks we perform with\nlittle or no conscious thought.\nHowever, when something breaks the cause-and-effect pattern we've come to expect — when we\nencounter something outside the norm — we suddenly become aware of it again.\n[lxxii] Novelty sparks\nour interest, makes us pay attention, and — like a baby encountering a friendly dog for the first time\n— we seem to love it.\nRewards of the Tribe, Hunt, and Self\nIn the 1950s, psychologist B.F. Skinner conducted experiments to understand how variability\nimpacted animal behavior.\n[lxxiii]\nFirst, Skinner placed pigeons inside a box rigged to deliver a food\npellet to the birds every time they pressed a lever. Similar to Olds’ and Milner’s lab mice, the\npigeons learned the cause-and-effect relationship between pressing the lever and receiving the food.\nIn the next part of the experiment, Skinner added variability. Instead of providing a pellet every\ntime a pigeon tapped the lever, the machine discharged food after a random number of taps.\nSometimes the lever would dispense food, sometimes not. Skinner revealed that the intermittent\nreward dramatically increased the number of times the pigeons tapped the lever. Adding variability\nincreased the frequency of the pigeons completing the intended action.\nSkinner’s pigeons tell us a great deal about what helps drive our own behaviors. More recent\nexperiments reveal that variability increases activity in the nucleus accumbens and spikes levels of\nthe neurotransmitter dopamine, driving our hungry search for rewards.\n[lxxiv] Researchers observed\nincreased dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens in experiments involving monetary rewards as\nwell as in a study of heterosexual men viewing images of attractive women’s faces.\n[lxxv]\nVariable rewards can be found in all sorts of products and experiences that hold our attention.\nThey fuel our drive to check email, browse the web, or bargain-shop. I propose that variable rewards\ncome in three types: Tribe, hunt and self (figure 20). Habit-forming products utilize one or more of\nthese variable reward types.\nFigure 20\nRewards of the Tribe\nWe are a species that depends on each other. Rewards of the tribe, or social rewards, are driven by\nour connectedness with other people. Our brains are adapted to seek rewards that make us feel\naccepted, attractive, important, and included. Many of our institutions and industries are built around\nthis need for social reinforcement. From civic and religious groups to spectator sports and\n“watercooler” television shows, the need to feel social connectedness shapes our values and drives\nmuch of how we spend our time.\nIt is no surprise that social media has exploded in popularity. Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and\nseveral other sites collectively provide over a billion people with powerful social rewards on a\nvariable schedule. With every post, tweet, or pin, users anticipate social validation. Rewards of the\ntribe keep users coming back, wanting more.\nSites that leverage tribal rewards benefit from what psychologist Albert Bandura called “social\nlearning theory.”\n[lxxvi] Bandura studied the power of modeling and ascribed special powers to our\nability to learn from others. In particular, Bandura showed that people who observe someone being\nrewarded for a particular behavior are more likely to alter their own beliefs and subsequent actions.\nNotably, Bandura also showed that this technique works particularly well when people observe the\nbehavior of people most like themselves, or those who are slightly more experienced (and, therefore,\nrole models).\n[lxxvii] This is exactly the kind of targeted demographic and interest-level segmentation that\nsocial media companies such as Facebook and industry-specific sites such as Stack Overflow\nselectively apply.\nHere are some online examples of rewards of the tribe:\nFacebook\nFacebook provides numerous examples of variable social rewards. Logging-in reveals an endless\nstream of content friends have shared, comments from others, and running tallies of how many people\nhave “liked” something (figure 21). The uncertainty of what users will find each time they visit the\nsite creates the intrigue needed to pull them back again.\nWhile variable content gets users to keep searching for interesting tidbits in their Newsfeeds, a\nclick of the “Like” button provides a variable reward for the content’s creators. “Likes” and\ncomments offer tribal validation for those who shared the content, and provide variable rewards that\nmotivate them to continue posting.\nFigure 21\nStack Overflow\nStack Overflow is the world’s largest question-and-answer site for software developers. As with\nother user-generated content sites such as Quora, Wikipedia, and YouTube, all of Stack Overflow’s\ncontent is created voluntarily by people who use the site. A staggering 5,000 answers to questions are\ngenerated per day by site members. Many of these responses provide detailed, highly technical and\ntime-consuming answers. But why do so many people spend so much time doing all this work for\nfree? What motivates them to invest the effort into what others may see as the burdensome task of\nwriting technical documentation?\nStack Overflow devotees write responses in anticipation of rewards of the tribe. Each time a user\nsubmits an answer, other members have the opportunity to vote the response up or down. The best\nresponses percolate upwards, accumulating points for their authors (figure 22). When they reach\ncertain point levels, members earn badges, which confer special status and privileges. Of course, the\nprocess of accumulating upvotes (and, therefore, points and badges) is highly variable — no one\nknows how many they will receive from the community when responding to a question.\nFigure 22\nStack Overflow works because, like all of us, software engineers find satisfaction in contributing\nto a community they care about; and the element of variability turns a seemingly mundane task into an\nengaging, game-like experience. But on Stack Overflow, points are not just an empty game mechanic,\nthey confer special value by representing how much someone has contributed to their tribe. Users\nenjoy the feeling of helping their fellow programmers and earning the respect of people whose\nopinions they value.\nLeague of Legends\nLeague of Legends, a popular computer game, launched in 2009 and quickly achieved tremendous\nsuccess. But soon after its launch, the game’s owners found they had a serious problem: The online\nvideo game was filled with “trolls” — people who enjoyed bullying other players while being\nprotected by the anonymity the game provides. Soon, League of Legends earned a nasty reputation for\nhaving an “unforgiving — even abusive — community.”\n[lxxviii] A leading industry publication wrote,\n“League of Legends has become well known for at least two things: proving the power of the free-toplay model in the West and a vicious player community.”\n[lxxix]\nTo combat the trolls, the game creators designed a reward system leveraging Bandura’s social\nlearning theory, which they called Honor Points (figure 23). The system gave players the ability to\naward points for particularly sportsmanlike conduct worthy of recognition. These virtual kudos\nencouraged positive behavior and helped the best and most cooperative players to stand out in the\ncommunity. The number of points earned was highly variable and could only be conferred by other\nplayers. Honor Points soon became a coveted marker of tribe-conferred status and helped weed out\ntrolls by signaling to others which players should be avoided.\nFigure 23\nRewards of the Hunt\nFor years, scientists have tried to answer a central question of human evolution: How did early\nhumans hunt for food? Most evolutionary biologists agree that consuming animal protein was a\nsignificant milestone that led to better nutrition and, ultimately, bigger brains but the tactical details of\nthe hunt remain hazy.\n[lxxx] We know our ancestors handcrafted spears and arrows for hunting, but\nevidence shows that these weapons were only invented 500,000 years ago,\n[lxxxi]\nwhereas we’ve been\neating meat for over 2 million years.\n[lxxxii] How then, did we hunt during the first 75 percent of our\nexistence?\nAccording to Harvard evolutionary biologist Daniel Lieberman, we chased down our dinner. Early\nhumans killed animals using a technique known as “persistence hunting,” a practice still common\namong today’s few remaining pre-agrarian societies. One of these groups, the San people of Southern\nAfrica, hunt for kudu, a large deer-like animal, using a technique similar to the way Lieberman\nbelieves humans hunted for the vast majority of our species’ history. The way we evolved to hunt\nwild game may help explain why we find ourselves compelled to use certain products today.\nIn Africa, the chase begins when a group of San hunters separate a large kudu bull from the herd.\nThe animal’s heavy antlers slows him down, making him less agile than the female kudus. Once the\nanimal is isolated from the pack, a single San hunter begins the hunt, keeping a steady pace as the\nanimal leaps ahead in fear. At first, it appears the man will never catch up to the bounding beast. At\ntimes he struggles to keep the animal in sight through the dry brush.\nBut the hunter knows he can use the animal’s weaknesses to his advantage. The powerful kudu is\nmuch faster in short sprints, but the kudu’s skin is covered with fur and can not dissipate heat like the\nrunner’s skin can. According to Lieberman, “Quadrupeds can not pant and gallop at the same\ntime.”\n[lxxxiii]\nSo while the kudu must stop to catch his breath, the hunter begins closing in, not to catch it\nbut to run it to exhaustion.\nAfter being tracked for a sweltering eight hours under the African sun, the beast is finally ready to\ngive up, collapsing in surrender with barely a struggle. The meager hundred-pound San hunter outlasts\nthe powerful 500 pound beast with little more than his persistence and the biomechanical gifts\nevolution has given him. The hunter swiftly and ceremoniously kills his prize, piercing a vein in the\nanimal’s neck so that he can feed his children and his tribe.\nBy running on two feet and bereft of the body hair typical of other primates, our species gained a\nmassive advantage over larger mammals. Our ability to maintain steady pursuit gave us the capacity\nto hunt large prehistoric game. But persistence hunting was not only made possible because of our\nbodies; changes in our brains also played a significant role.\nDuring the chase, the runner is driven by the pursuit itself; and this same mental hardwiring also\nprovides clues into the source of our insatiable desires today. The dogged determination that keeps\nSan hunters chasing kudu is the same mechanism that keeps us wanting and buying. Although it is a\nlong way from bushmen to businessmen, the mental processes of the hunt remain largely the same.\nThe search for resources defines the next type of variable reward — the rewards of hunt. The need\nto acquire physical objects, such as food and other supplies that aid our survival, is part of our\nbrain’s operating system. But where we once hunted for food, today we hunt for other things. In\nmodern society, food can be bought with cash, and more recently by extension, information translates\ninto money.\nRewards of the hunt existed long before the advent of computers. But today we find numerous\nexamples of variable rewards associated with the pursuit of resources and information that compel us\nwith the same determination as the San hunter chasing his prey.\nHere are a few examples of products that create habits by leveraging rewards of the hunt:\nMachine Gambling\nMost people know that gambling benefits the casino or broker far more than the players. As the old\nadage says, “the house always wins.” Yet despite this knowledge, the multi-billion dollar gambling\nindustry continues to thrive.\nSlot machines provide a classic example of variable rewards of the hunt. Gamblers plunk $1\nbillion per day into slot machines in American casinos, which is a testament to the machines’ power\nto compel players.\n[lxxxiv] By awarding money in random intervals, games of chance entice players with\nthe prospect of a jackpot. Of course, winning is entirely outside the gambler’s control — yet the\npursuit can be intoxicating.\nTwitter\nThe “feed” has become a social staple of many online products. The stream of limitless information\ndisplayed in a scrolling interface makes for a compelling reward of the hunt. The Twitter timeline, for\nexample, is filled with a mix of both mundane and relevant content. This variety creates an enticingly\nunpredictable user experience. On occasion a user might find a particularly interesting piece of news,\nwhile other times, she won’t. But to keep hunting for more information, all that is needed is a flick of\nthe finger or scroll of a mouse. Users scroll and scroll and scroll to search for variable rewards in\nthe form of relevant tweets (figure 24).\nFigure 24\nPinterest\nPinterest, a company that has grown to reach over 50 million monthly users worldwide, also employs\na feed, but with a visual twist.\n[lxxxv] The online pinboarding site is a virtual smorgasbord of objects of\ndesire. The site is curated by its community of users who ensure that a high degree of intriguing\ncontent appears on each page.\nPinterest users never know what they will find on the site. To keep them searching and scrolling,\nthe company employs an unusual design. As the user scrolls to the bottom of the page, some images\nappear to be cut-off. Often, images appear out of view below the browser fold. However, these\nimages offer a glimpse of what's ahead, even if just barely visible. To relieve their curiosity, all users\nhave to do is scroll to reveal the full picture (figure 25). As more images load on the page, the\nendless search for variable rewards of the hunt continues.\nFigure 25\nRewards of the Self\nFinally, there are the variable rewards we seek for a more personal form of gratification. We are\ndriven to conquer obstacles, even if just for the satisfaction of doing so. Pursuing a task to completion\ncan influence people to continue all sorts of behaviors.\n[lxxxvi]\nSurprisingly, we even pursue these\nrewards when we don’t outwardly appear to enjoy them. For example, watching someone investing\ncountless hours into completing a tabletop puzzle can reveal frustrated face contortions and even\nsounds of muttered profanity. Although puzzles offer no prize other than the satisfaction of\ncompletion, for some the painstaking search for the right pieces can be a wonderfully mesmerizing\nstruggle.\nThe rewards of the self are fueled by “intrinsic motivation” as highlighted by the work of Edward\nDeci and Richard Ryan.\n[lxxxvii] Their self-determination theory espouses that people desire, among other\nthings, to gain a sense of competency. Adding an element of mystery to this goal makes the pursuit all\nthe more enticing.\nThe experiences below offer examples of variable rewards of the self:\nVideo Games\nRewards of the self are a defining component in video games, as players seek to master the skills\nneeded to pursue their quest. Leveling up, unlocking special powers, and other game mechanics fulfill\na player's desire for competency by showing progression and completion.\nFor example, advancing a character through the popular online game World of Warcraft unlocks\nnew abilities for the player (figure 26). The thirst to acquire advanced weaponry, visit uncharted\nlands, and improve their characters’ scores motivates players to invest more hours in the game.\nFigure 26\nEmail\nYou do not have to be a hard-core video gamer to be heavily influenced by game-like experiences.\nThe humble email system provides an example of how the search for mastery, completion, and\ncompetence moves users to habitual, sometimes mindless, actions. Have you ever caught yourself\nchecking your email for no particular reason? Perhaps you unconsciously decided to open it to see\nwhat messages might be waiting for you. For many, the number of unread messages represents a sort\nof goal to be completed.\nBut to feel rewarded, the user must have a sense of accomplishment. Mailbox, an email application\nacquired by Dropbox in 2013 for a rumored $100 million, aims to solve the frustration of fighting\nwhat feels like a losing inbox battle.\n[lxxxviii] Mailbox cleverly segments emails into sorted folders to\nincrease the frequency of users achieving “inbox zero” — a near-mystical state of having no unread\nemails (figure 27). Of course, some of the folder sorting is done through digital sleight-of-hand by\npushing some low priority emails out of sight, and then having them reappear at a later date. But by\ngiving users the sense that they are processing their inbox more efficiently, Mailbox delivers\nsomething other email clients do not — a feeling of completion and mastery.\nFigure 27\nCodecademy\nLearning to program is not easy. Software engineers take months, if not years, of diligent hard work\nbefore they have the confidence and skill to write useful code. Many people attempt to learn how to\nwrite software, only to give up, frustrated at the tedious process of learning a new computer language.\nCodecademy seeks to make learning to write code more fun and rewarding. The site offers step-bystep instructions for building a web app, animation, and even a browser-based game. The interactive\nlessons deliver immediate feedback, in contrast to traditional methods of learning to code by writing\nwhole programs. At Codecademy, users can enter a single correct function and the code works or\ndoesn’t, providing instant feedback.\nLearning a new skill is often filled with errors but Codecademy uses the difficulty to its advantage.\nThere is a constant element of the unknown when it comes to completing the task at hand and like a\ngame, users receive variable rewards as they learn — sometimes they succeed, sometimes they fail.\nBut as their competency level improves, users work to advance through levels, mastering the\ncurriculum. Codecademy’s symbols of progression and instantaneous variable feedback tap into\nrewards of the self, turning a difficult path into an engaging challenge (figure 28).\nFigure 28\n***\nImportant Considerations for Designing Reward Systems\nVariable Rewards Are Not a Free Pass\nIn May 2007, a site called Mahalo.com was born. A flagship feature of the new site was a questionand-answer forum known as Mahalo Answers. Unlike previous Q&A sites, Mahalo utilized a special\nincentive to get users to ask and answer questions.\nFirst, people who submitted a question would offer a bounty in the form of a virtual currency\nknown as “Mahalo Dollars.” Then, other users would contribute answers to the question and the best\nresponse would receive the bounty, which could be exchanged for real money. By providing a\nmonetary reward, the Mahalo founders believed they could drive user engagement and form new\nonline user habits.\nAt first, Mahalo garnered significant attention and traffic. At its high point, 14.1 million users\nworldwide visited the site monthly.\n[lxxxix] But over time, users began to lose interest. Although the\npayout of the bounties were variable, somehow users did not find the monetary rewards enticing\nenough.\nBut as Mahalo struggled to retain users, another Q&A site began to boom. Quora, launched in 2010\nby two former Facebook employees, quickly grew in popularity. Unlike Mahalo, Quora did not offer\na single cent to anyone answering user questions. Why, then, have users stayed highly engaged with\nQuora, but not with Mahalo, despite its variable monetary rewards?\nIn Mahalo’s case, executives assumed that paying users would drive repeat engagement with the\nsite. After all, people like money, right? Unfortunately, Mahalo had an incomplete understanding of its\nusers’ drivers.\nUltimately, the company found that people did not want to use a Q&A site to make money. If the\ntrigger was a desire for monetary rewards, the user was better off spending their time earning an\nhourly wage. And if the payouts were meant to take the form of a game, like a slot machine, then the\nrewards came far too infrequently and were too small to matter.\nHowever, Quora demonstrated that social rewards and the variable reinforcement of recognition\nfrom peers proved to be much more frequent and salient motivators. Quora instituted an upvoting\nsystem that reports user satisfaction with answers and provides a steady stream of social feedback.\nQuora’s social rewards have proven more attractive than Mahalo’s monetary rewards.\nOnly by understanding what truly matters to users can a company correctly match the right variable\nreward to their intended behavior.\nRecently, “gamification” — defined as the use of game-like elements in non-gaming environments\n— has been used with varying success. Points, badges, and leaderboards can prove effective, but\nonly if they scratch the user’s itch. When there is a mismatch between the customer’s problem and the\ncompany’s assumed solution, no amount of gamification will help spur engagement. Likewise, if the\nuser has no ongoing itch at all — say, no need to return repeatedly to a site that lacks any value\nbeyond the initial visit — gamification will fail because of a lack of inherent interest in the product or\nservice offered. In other words, gamification is not a one-size-fits-all solution for driving user\nengagement.\nVariable rewards are not magic fairy dust that a product designer can sprinkle onto a product to\nmake it instantly more attractive. Rewards must fit into the narrative of why the product is used and\nalign with the user's internal triggers and motivations.\nMaintain a Sense of Autonomy\nQuora found success by connecting the right reward to the intended behavior of asking and answering\nquestions. But in August 2012, the company committed a very public blunder — one that illustrates\nanother important consideration when using variable rewards.\nIn an effort to increase user engagement, Quora introduced a new feature called “views,” which\nrevealed the real identity of people visiting a particular question or answer. For users, the feedback\nof knowing who was seeing content they added to the site proved very intriguing. Users could now\nknow, for example, when a celebrity or prominent venture capital investor viewed something they\ncreated.\nHowever, the feature ultimately backfired. Quora automatically opted users into the new feature\nwithout alerting them that their browsing history on the site would be exposed to others. In an instant,\nusers lost their treasured anonymity when asking, answering, or simply viewing Quora questions that\nwere personal, awkward, or intimate.\n[xc] The move sparked a user revolt and Quora reversed course a\nfew weeks later, making the feature explicitly opt-in.\n[xci]\nIn the case of Quora, the change felt forced and bordered on coercion. While influencing behavior\ncan be a part of good product design, heavy-handed efforts can have adverse consequences and risk\nlosing users’ trust.\nWe’ll address the morality of manipulation in a later chapter — but aside from the ethical\nconsiderations, there is an important point regarding the psychological role of autonomy and how it\ncan impact user engagement.\nAs part of a French study, researchers wanted to know if they could influence how much money\npeople handed to a total stranger asking for bus fare by using just a few specially encoded words.\nThey discovered a technique so simple and effective it doubled the amount people gave.\nThe turn of phrase has not only proven to increase how much bus fare people give, but has also\nbeen effective in boosting charitable donations and participation in voluntary surveys. In fact, a recent\nmeta-analysis of 42 studies involving over 22,000 participants concluded that these few words,\nplaced at the end of a request, are a highly-effective way to gain compliance, doubling the likelihood\nof people saying “yes.”\n[xcii]\nThe magic words the researchers discovered? The phrase, “but you are free to accept or refuse.”\nThe “but you are free” technique demonstrates how we are more likely to be persuaded when our\nability to choose is reaffirmed. Not only was the effect observed during face-to-face interactions, but\nalso over email. Although the research did not directly look at how products and services might use\nthe technique, the study provides an important insight into how companies maintain or lose the user’s\nattention.\nWhy does reminding people of their freedom to choose, as demonstrated in the French bus fare\nstudy, prove so effective?\nThe researchers believe the phrase “but you are free” disarms our instinctive rejection of being\ntold what to do. If you have ever grumbled at your mother telling you to put on a coat or felt your\nblood pressure rise when your boss micro-manages you, you have experienced what psychologists\ncall “reactance,” the hair-trigger response to threats to your autonomy.\nHowever, when a request is coupled with an affirmation of the right to choose, reactance is kept at\nbay. But can the principles of autonomy and reactance carry over into the way products change user\nbehavior and drive the formation of new user habits? Here are two examples to make the case that\nthey do, but of course, you are free to make up your mind for yourself.\nTake, for example, establishing the habit of better nutrition, a common goal for many Americans.\nSearching in the Apple App Store for the word “diet” returns 3,235 apps, all promising to help users\nshed extra pounds. The first app in the long list is MyFitnessPal, whose iOS app is rated by over\n350,000 people.\nA year ago when I decided to lose a few pounds, I installed the app and gave it a try. MyFitnessPal\nis simple enough to use. The app asked me to log what I ate and presented me with a calorie score\nbased on my weight loss goal.\nFor a few days, I stuck with the program and diligently input information about everything I ate.\nHad I been a person who logs food with pen and paper, MyFitnessPal would have been a welcome\nimprovement.\nHowever, I was not a calorie tracker prior to using MyFitnessPal and although using the app was\nnovel at first, it soon became a drag. Keeping a food diary was not part of my daily routine and was\nnot something I came to the app wanting to do. I wanted to lose weight and the app was telling me\nhow to do it with its strict method of tracking calories in and calories out. Unfortunately, I soon found\nthat forgetting to enter a meal made it impossible to get back on the program – the rest of my day was\na nutritional wash.\nSoon, I began to feel obligated to confess my mealtime transgressions to my phone. MyFitnessPal\nbecame MyFitnessPain. Yes, I had chosen to install the app at first, but despite my best intentions, my\nmotivation faded and using the app became a chore. Adopting a weird new behavior — calorie\ntracking, in my case — felt like something I had to do, not something I wanted to do. My only options\nwere to comply or quit. So I quit.\nOn the other hand Fitocracy, another health app, approaches behavior change very differently. The\ngoal of the app is similar to its competitors — to help people establish better diet and exercise\nroutines. However, it leverages familiar behaviors users want to do, instead of have to do.\nAt first, the Fitocracy experience is similar to other health apps, encouraging new members to track\ntheir food consumption and exercise. But where Fitocracy differentiates itself is in its recognition that\nmost users will quickly fall off the wagon, just as I had with MyFitnessPal, unless the app taps into\nexisting autonomous behavior.\nBefore my reactance alarm went off, I started receiving kudos from other members of the site after\nentering my very first run. Curious to know who was sending the virtual encouragement, I logged in.\nThere, I immediately saw a question from “mrosplock5,” a woman looking for advice on what to do\nabout knee pain from running. Having experienced similar trouble several years back, I left a quick\nreply: “Running barefoot (or with minimalist shoes) eliminated my knee pains. Strange but true!”\nI have not used Fitocracy for long, but it is easy to see how someone could get hooked. Fitocracy is\nfirst and foremost an online community. The app roped me in by closely mimicking real-world gym\njabber among friends. The ritual of connecting with like-minded people existed long before\nFitocracy, and the company leverages this behavior by making it easier and more rewarding to share\nencouragement, exchange advice, and receive praise. In fact, a recent study found social factors were\nthe most important reasons people used the service and recommended it to others.\n[xciii]\nSocial acceptance is something we all crave, and Fitocracy leverages the universal need for\nconnection as an on-ramp to fitness, making new tools and features available to users as they develop\nnew habits. The choice for the Fitocracy user is therefore between the old way of doing an existing\nbehavior and the company’s tailored solution for easing the user into healthy new habits.\nTo be fair, MyFitnessPal also has social features intended to keep members engaged. However, as\nopposed to Fitocracy, the benefits of interacting with the community come much later in the user\nexperience, if ever.\nClearly, it is too early to tell which among the multitudes of new wellness apps and products will\nemerge victorious, but the fact remains that the most successful consumer technologies — those that\nhave altered the daily behaviors of hundreds of millions of people — are the ones that nobody makes\nus use. Perhaps part of the appeal of sneaking in a few minutes on Facebook or checking scores on\nESPN.com is our access to a moment of pure autonomy – an escape from being told what to do by\nbosses and co-workers.\nUnfortunately, too many companies build their products betting users will do what they make themdo instead of letting them do what they want to do. Companies fail to change user behaviors because\nthey do not make their services enjoyable for its own sake, often asking users to learn new, unfamiliar\nactions instead of making old routines easier.\nCompanies that successfully change behaviors present users with an implicit choice between their\nold way of doing things and a new, more convenient way to fulfill existing needs. By maintaining the\nusers’ freedom to choose, products can facilitate the adoption of new habits and change behavior for\ngood.\nWhether coerced into doing something we did not intend, as was the case when Quora opted-in all\nusers to its “views” feature, or feeling forced to adopt a strange new calorie counting behavior on\nMyFitnessPal, people often feel constrained by threats to their autonomy and rebel. To change\nbehavior, products must ensure the users feel in control. People must want to use the service, not feel\nthey have to.\nBeware of Finite Variability\nIn 2008, a television series called Breaking Bad began receiving unprecedented critical and popular\nacclaim. The show followed the life of Walter White, a high school chemistry teacher who transforms\nhimself into a crystal meth-cooking drug lord. As the body count on the show piled up season after\nseason, so did its viewership.\n[xciv] The first episode of the final season in 2013 attracted 5.9 million\nviewers and by the end of the series Guinness World Records dubbed it the highest-rated TV series\nof all time.\n[xcv] Although Breaking Bad owes a great deal of its success to its talented cast and crew,\nfundamentally the program utilized a simple formula to keep people tuning in.\nAt the heart of every episode — and also across each season’s narrative arc — is a problem the\ncharacters must resolve. For example, during an episode in the first season, Walter White must find a\nway to dispose of the bodies of two rival drug dealers. Challenges prevent resolution of the conflict\nand suspense is created as the audience waits to find out how the storyline ends. In this particular\nepisode, White discovers one of the drug dealers is still alive and is faced with the dilemma of\nhaving to kill someone he thought was already dead. Invariably, each episode’s central conflict is\nresolved near the end of the show, at which time a new challenge arises to pique the viewer’s\ncuriosity. By design, the only way to know how Walter gets out of the mess he is in at the end of the\nlatest episode is to watch the next episode.\nThe cycle of conflict, mystery and resolution is as old as storytelling itself, and at the heart of every\ngood tale is variability. The unknown is fascinating and strong stories hold our attention by waiting to\nreveal what happens next. In a phenomenon called “experience-taking,” researchers have shown that\npeople who read a story about a character actually feel what the protagonist is feeling.\n[xcvi] As we step\ninto the character’s shoes we experience his or her motivations — including the search for rewards of\nthe tribe, hunt and self. We empathize with characters because they are driven by the same things that\ndrive us.\nBut if the search to resolve uncertainty is such a powerful tool of engagement, why do we\neventually lose interest in the things that once riveted us? Many people have experienced the intense\nfocus of being hooked on a TV series, a great book, a new video game or even the latest gadget. Yet,\nmost of us lose interest in a few days or week’s time. Why does the power of variable rewards seem\nto fade away?\nPerhaps no company in recent memory epitomizes the mercurial nature of variable rewards quite\nlike Zynga, makers of the hit Facebook game FarmVille. In 2009, FarmVille became an unmissable\npart of the global zeitgeist. The game smashed records as it quickly reached 83.8 million monthly\nactive users by leveraging the Facebook platform to acquire new players.\n[xcvii]\nIn 2010, as “farmers”\ntended their digital crops — while paying real money for virtual goods and levels — the company\ngenerated more than $36 million in revenue.\n[xcviii]\nThe company seemed invincible and set a course for growth by cloning its FarmVille success into\na franchise. Zynga soon released CityVille, ChefVille, FrontierVille, and several more “-Ville” titles\nusing familiar game mechanics in the hope that people would enjoy them as voraciously as they had\nFarmVille. By March 2012, Zynga’s stock was flying high and the company was valued at over $10\nbillion.\nBut by November of that same year, the stock was down over 80 percent. It turned out that Zynga’s\nnew games were not really new at all. The company had simply re-skinned FarmVille, and soon\nplayers had lost interest and investors followed suit. What was once novel and intriguing became rote\nand boring. The “Villes” had lost their variability, and with it, their viability.\nAs the Zynga story demonstrates, an element of mystery is an important component of continued\nuser interest. Online games like FarmVille suffer from what I call “finite variability” — an\nexperience that becomes predictable after use. While Breaking Bad built suspense over time as the\naudience wondered how the series would end, eventually interest in the show would wane when it\nfinally concluded. The series enthralled viewers with each new episode, but now that it is all over,\nhow many people who saw it once will watch it again? With the plot lines known and the central\nmysteries revealed, the show just won’t seem as interesting the second time around. Perhaps the show\nmight resurrect interest with a new episode in the future, but viewership for old episodes people have\nalready seen will never peak as it did when they were new. Experiences with finite variability\nbecome less engaging because they eventually become predictable.\nBusinesses with finite variability are not inferior per se, they just operate under different\nconstraints. They must constantly churn out new content and experiences to cater to their consumers’\ninsatiable desire for novelty. It is no coincidence that both Hollywood and the video gaming industry\noperate under what is called the “studio model,” whereby a deep-pocketed company provides\nbacking and distribution to a portfolio of movies or games, uncertain which one will become the next\nmega-hit.\nThis is in contrast with companies making products exhibiting “infinite variability” — experiences\nthat maintain user interest by sustaining variability with use. For example, games played to\ncompletion offer finite variability while those played with others people have higher degrees of\ninfinite variability because the players themselves alter the game-play throughout. World of Warcraft,\nthe world's most popular massively multiplayer online role-playing game, still captures the attention\nof more than 10 million active users eight years after its first release.\n[xcix] While FarmVille is played\nmostly in solitude, World of Warcraft is played with teams and it is the hard-to-predict behavior of\nother people that keeps the game interesting.\nWhile content consumption, like watching a TV show, is an example of finite variability, content\ncreation is infinitely variable. Sites like Dribbble, a platform for designers and artists to showcase\ntheir work, exemplify the longer-lasting engagement that comes from infinite variability. On the site,\ncontributors share their designs in search of feedback from other artists. As new trends and design\npatterns change, so do Dribbble’s pages. The variety of what Dribbble users can create is limitless,\nand the constantly changing site always offers new surprises.\nPlatforms like YouTube, Facebook, Pinterest and Twitter all leverage user-generated content to\nprovide visitors with a never-ending stream of newness. Of course, even sites utilizing infinite\nvariability are not guaranteed to hold onto users forever. Eventually — to borrow from Michael\nLewis’s title — the “new, new thing” comes along and consumers migrate to it for the reasons\ndiscussed in earlier chapters. However, products utilizing infinite variability stand a better chance of\nholding onto users’ attention, while those with finite variability must constantly reinvent themselves\njust to keep pace.\nWhich Rewards Should You Offer?\nFundamentally, variable reward systems must satisfy users’ needs, while leaving them wanting to reengage. The most habit-forming products and services utilize one or more of the three variable\nrewards types of tribe, hunt and self. In fact, many habit-forming products offer multiple variable\nrewards.\nEmail, for example, utilizes all three variable reward types. What subconsciously compels us to\ncheck our email? First, there is uncertainty surrounding who might be sending us a message. We have\na social obligation to respond to emails and a desire to be seen as agreeable (rewards of the tribe).\nWe may also be curious about what information is in the email. Perhaps something related to our\ncareer or business awaits us? Checking email informs us of opportunities or threats to our material\npossessions and livelihood (rewards of the hunt). Lastly, email is in itself a task — challenging us to\nsort, categorize and act to eliminate unread messages. We are motivated by the uncertain nature of our\nfluctuating email count and feel compelled to gain control of our inbox (rewards of the self).\nAs B.F. Skinner discovered over 50 years ago, variable rewards are a powerful inducement to\nrepeat actions. Understanding what moves users to return to habit-forming products gives designers\nan opportunity to build products that align with their interests.\nHowever, simply giving users what they want is not enough to create a habit-forming product. The\nfeedback loop of the first three steps of the hook — trigger, action and variable reward — still\nmisses a final critical phase. In the next chapter, we will learn how getting people to invest their time,\neffort, or social equity in your product is a requirement for repeat use.\n***\nRemember and Share\n- Variable Reward is the third phase of the Hook Model, and there are three types of variable\nrewards: tribe, hunt and self.\n- Rewards of the tribe is the search for social rewards fueled by connectedness with other\npeople.\n- Rewards of the hunt is the search for material resources and information.\n- Rewards of the self is the search for intrinsic rewards of mastery, competence, and\ncompletion.\n- When our autonomy is threatened, we feel constrained by our lack of choices and often rebel\nagainst doing a new behavior. Psychologists call this “reactance.” Maintaining a sense of user\nautonomy is a requirement for repeat engagement.\n- Experiences with finite variability become increasingly predictable with use and lose their\nappeal over time. Experiences that maintain user interest by sustaining variability with use exhibit\ninfinite variability.\n- Variable rewards must satisfy users’ needs, while leaving them wanting to re-engage with the\nproduct.\n***\nDo This Now\nRefer to the answers you came up with in the last “Do This Now” section to complete the following\nexercises:\n- Speak with five of your customers in an open-ended interview to identify what they find\nenjoyable or encouraging about using your product. Are there any moments of delight or surprise?\nIs there anything they find particularly satisfying about using the product?\n- Review the steps your customer takes to use your product or service habitually. What outcome\n(reward) alleviates the user’s pain? Is the reward fulfilling, yet leaves the user wanting more?\n- Brainstorm three ways your product might heighten users’ search for variable rewards using:\n- Rewards of the Tribe - gratification from others\n- Rewards of the Hunt - things, money or information\n- Rewards of the Self - mastery, completion, competency or consistency\n\n5. INVESTMENT\nIn the Trigger phase of the Hook Model, we discussed the importance of aligning with the right\ninternal triggers. Then, by utilizing external triggers, designers can prompt users with information for\nthe next intended action.\nNext, in the Action phase, we learned about the role of the smallest actions taken in anticipation of\nimmediate rewards. And in the previous chapter on Rewards, we looked at how variable outcomes\ninfluence repeat engagement. There is one last step in the Hook Model that is critical for building\nhabit-forming technologies. Before users create the mental associations that activate their automatic\nbehaviors, they must first invest in the product.\nChanging Attitude\nIn chapter one, we learned about the tooth flossing study conducted at University College London,\nwhere researchers determined that the frequency of a new behavior is a leading factor in forming a\nnew habit. The study also found that the second most important factor in habit formation is a change in\nthe participant’s attitude about the behavior. The finding is consistent with the Habit Zone graph\nexplained in chapter one, which illustrates that for a behavior to become routine it must occur with\nsignificant frequency and perceived utility. Attitude change is the movement up the perceived utility\naxis until the behavior enters the Habit Zone.\nBut in order for a change in attitude to occur, there must be a change in how users perceive the\nbehavior. In this chapter, we will start by exploring the mystery surrounding how small investments\nchange our perception, turning unfamiliar actions into everyday habits.\nA psychological phenomenon known as the escalation of commitment has been shown to make our\nbrains do all sorts of funny things. The power of commitment makes some people play video games\nuntil they keel over and die.\n[c]\nIt is used to influence people to give more to charity.\n[ci]\nIt has even been\nused to coerce prisoners of war into switching allegiances.\n[cii] The commitments we make have a\npowerful effect on us and play an important role in the things we do, the products we buy, and the\nhabits we form.\nThe more users invest time and effort into a product or service, the more they value it. In fact, there\nis ample evidence to suggest that our labor leads to love.\nWe Irrationally Value Our Efforts\nIn a 2011 study, Dan Ariely, Michael Norton and Daniel Mochon measured the effect of labor on how\npeople value things.\n[ciii]\nUniversity students in America were given instructions to assemble an origami crane or frog. After\nthe exercise, students were asked to purchase their creation, bidding up to one dollar. Builders were\ninformed that a random number between 0 and 100 would be drawn. If it exceeded their reservation\nprice, the builders would return empty handed — but if it was equal to or less than the builder's bid,\nthey would pay their bid and keep the origami. Meanwhile, a separate group of students located in\nanother room, unaware of the identity of the builders, were asked to bid on their origami using the\nsame procedure. Similarly, a third independent group was asked to bid on expert-made origami under\nthe same criteria.\nThe results showed that those who made their own origami animals valued their creation five times\nhigher than the second group’s valuation, and nearly as high as the expert-made origami values (figure\n29). In other words, those who invested labor associated greater value with their paper creations\nsimply because they had worked on them. Ariely calls this the “IKEA effect.”\nFigure 29\nIKEA, the world’s largest furniture retailer, sells affordable, ready-to-assemble household\nfurnishings. The Swedish company’s key innovation is its packaging process, which allows the\ncompany to decrease labor costs, increase distribution efficiency, and better utilize the real estate in\nits stores.\nUnlike its competitors who sell pre-assembled merchandise, IKEA puts its customers to work. It\nturns out there’s a hidden benefit to making users invest physical effort in assembling the product —\nby asking customers to assemble their own furniture, Ariely believes they adopt an irrational love of\nthe furniture they built, just like the test subjects did in the origami experiments. Businesses that\nleverage user effort confer higher value to their products simply because their users have put work\ninto them. The users have invested in the products through their labor.\nWe Seek to be Consistent with Our Past Behaviors\nHow much do past behaviors alter our future actions? We’d like to think we are free to choose to act\nin any way we’d like — that our judgment is not clouded by our past actions. But in fact, studies\nreveal that our past is an excellent predictor of our future.\nA team of researchers asked a group of suburban residents to place large, unsightly signs in front of\ntheir homes which read “Drive Carefully.”\n[civ] Two groups were tested. In the first group, only 17\npercent of the subjects agreed to the request, while 76 percent of those in the second group agreed to\npost the ugly yard signs. What was the cause of this huge discrepancy? The groups were identical,\nwith the exception of one factor.\nThose in the second group were approached two weeks prior to the yard sign request and asked to\nplace a much smaller, three-inch sign with the words, “Be a safe driver,” in their window. Nearly\neveryone who was asked to place the smaller message agreed. When the researchers returned two\nweeks later, a whopping majority of these residents willingly replaced the small sign with the large\none on their front lawns.\nThe homeowner’s greater willingness to place the large, obtrusive sign on their lawns after\nagreeing to the smaller ones demonstrates the impact of our predilection for consistency with our past\nbehaviors. Little investments, such as placing a tiny sign in a window, can lead to big changes in\nfuture behaviors.\nWe Avoid Cognitive Dissonance\nIn a classic Aesop’s Fable, a hungry fox encounters grapes hanging from a vine. The fox desperately\nwants the grapes. But as hard as he may try, he can not reach them. Frustrated, the fox decides the\ngrapes must be sour and that he therefore would not want them anyway.\nIn the story, the fox comforts himself by changing his perception of the grapes because it is too\nuncomfortable to reconcile the thought that the grapes are sweet and ready for the taking, and yet, he\ncan not have them. To reconcile these two conflicting ideas, the fox changes his perception of the\ngrapes and in the process relieves the pain of what psychologists call “cognitive dissonance.”\nThe irrational manipulation of the way one sees the world is not limited to fictional animals in\nchildren’s stories. We humans do this as well.\nConsider your reaction the first time you sipped a beer or tried spicy food. Was it tasty? Unlikely.\nOur bodies are designed to reject alcohol and capsaicin, the compound that creates the sensation of\nheat in spicy food. Our innate reaction to these acquired tastes is to reject them, and yet, we learn to\nlike them through repeated exposure. We see others enjoying them, try a little more, and over time\ncondition ourselves. To avoid the cognitive dissonance of not liking something in which others seem\nto take so much pleasure, we slowly change our perception of the thing we once did not enjoy.\n***\nTogether, the three tendencies described above influence our future actions. The more effort we put\ninto something, the more likely we are to value it. We are more likely to be consistent with our past\nbehaviors. And finally, we change our preferences to avoid cognitive dissonance.\nIn sum, our tendencies lead to a mental process known as rationalization whereby we change our\nattitudes and beliefs to psychologically adapt. Rationalization helps us give reasons for our\nbehaviors, even when those reasons might have been designed by others.\nAt a 2010 industry conference, Jesse Schell, a renowned game designer and professor at Carnegie\nMellon University, articulated the peculiar train of thought some players exhibit online.\n[cv]\nSchell\nexamined Mafia Wars, one of Zynga’s first breakout hits, which like FarmVille, attracted millions of\nplayers.\n“There's definitely a lot of psychology here, because if someone had said 'Hey, we're going to\nmake a text-based mafia game that's going to make over $100 million,' you'd say, 'I don't think you'll\ndo that.' Right?” Schell said, channeling the critics of the day who originally dismissed the free,\nprimarily text-based online game. But Zynga used its understanding of human psychology to build an\nirresistible product at the time.\nMafia Wars was among the first games to utilize information about players’ Facebook friends. “It’s\nnot just a virtual world anymore. It’s your real friends.” Schell said. “And, you’re playing and it’s\nkind of cool ... but then hey, hey my real friend is better than me. How can I remedy that? Well, I can\nplay a long time or I could just put $20 in — AHA! It’s even better if that $20 I put in validates\nsomething I know is true, that I am greater than my college roommate, Steve.”\nSchell went on, “Combine that with the psychological idea … of rationalization, that anything you\nspend time on, you start to believe, ‘this must be worthwhile. Why? Because I’ve spent time on it!’\nAnd therefore it must be worth me kicking in $20 because, look at the time I’ve spent on it. And now\nthat I’ve kicked in $20, it must be valuable because only an idiot would kick in $20 if it wasn’t.”\nSchell’s description of the quirky process of Mafia Wars rationalization helps demonstrate the\nstrange logic of how we change our preferences. When players contemplate making a purchase, they\nacknowledge it is unwise to spend money on something that is not good. And yet, just like the fox that\nperceives the grapes as sour to reduce his frustration at not being able to reach them, players justify\ntheir purchases to help convince themselves of something they want to be true — namely, that they are\nnot foolish. The only solution is to keep paying to keep playing.\nThe cognitive changes that lead to behavior change help power the shift in how we view the\nproducts and services we use. But how are habit-forming products designed for user investment?\nHow can a product keep users committed to a service until it becomes a habit?\nBits of Work\nIn a standard feedback loop, the cue, action, and reward cycle can change our immediate behavior.\nFor example, a radar-equipped sign is an effective way to make drivers immediately slow down by\nshowing them their car’s speed relative to the posted speed limit.\nBut this pattern differs when it comes to how we form habits with products. The Hook Model is not\njust a framework for changing one-time behaviors, it is a design pattern to create unprompted\nengagement in order to connect the user’s problem to the designer’s solution. To form the associations\nneeded to create unprompted user engagement, something more than the three-step feedback loop is\nrequired.\nThe last step of the Hook Model is the Investment Phase, the point at which users are asked to do a\nbit of work. Here, users are prompted to put something of value into the system, which increases the\nlikelihood of them using the product and of successive passes through the hook cycle.\nUnlike in the Action Phase of the Hook discussed in chapter three, investments are about the\nanticipation of longer-term rewards, not immediate gratification.\nIn Twitter for example, the investment comes in the form of following another user. There is no\nimmediate reward for following someone, no stars or badges to affirm the action. Following is an\ninvestment in the service, which increases the likelihood of the user checking Twitter in the future.\nAlso in contrast to the Action Phase, the Investment Phase increases friction. This certainly breaks\nconventional thinking in the product design community that all user experiences should be as “easy”\n(and effortless) as possible. This approach still generally holds true, as does my advice in the Action\nPhase to make the intended actions as simple as possible. In the Investment Phase, however, asking\nusers to do a bit of work comes after users have received variable rewards, not before. The timing of\nasking for user investment is critically important. By asking for the investment after the reward, the\ncompany has an opportunity to leverage a central trait of human behavior.\nIn an experiment conducted by Stanford researchers, two groups of people were asked to complete\na task with the help of computers.\n[cvi] The study participants were initially asked to use their assigned\ncomputers to answer a series of questions. The computers provided to the first group were helpful\nwhen answering participants’ questions, while those provided to the second group were programmed\nto be unhelpful, offering unclear answers. After completing the task, participants then switched roles\nand the machines began asking the people for assistance with their questions.\nThe study found that the group given helpful computers performed almost twice as much work for\ntheir machines. The results showed that reciprocation is not just a characteristic expressed between\npeople, but also a trait observed when humans interact with machines. Conceivably, we humans\nevolved the tendency to reciprocate kindness because it improved our species’ ability to survive. As\nit turns out, we invest in products and services for the same reasons we put effort into our\nrelationships.\nThe big idea behind the Investment Phase is to leverage the user’s understanding that the service\nwill get better with use (and personal investment). Like a good friendship, the more effort people put\nin, the more both parties benefit.\nStoring Value\nUnlike physical goods in the real world, the software that runs our technology products can adapt\nitself to our needs. To become better with use, habit-forming technology utilizes investments users\nmake in the product to enhance the experience. The stored value users put into the product increases\nthe likelihood they will use it again in the future and comes in a variety of forms.\nContent\nEvery time users of Apple’s iTunes add a song to their collection, they are strengthening ties to the\nservice. The songs on a playlist are an example of how content increases the value of a service.\nNeither Apple iTunes nor their users created the songs, and yet, the more content users add, the more\nvaluable the music library becomes (figure 30).\nBy aggregating content with one service, users can do more with their music and iTunes gets better\nwith use by learning their preferences. With users’ continued investment, more songs also become\naccessible on multiple Apple devices. In 2013, Apple revealed that its new iTunes Radio service\nwould provide personalized music recommendations based on the kind of music in users’ iTunes\ncollections. The new feature provides yet another example of how technology adapts and improves\nbased on users’ investment.\nFigure 30\nContent can also be created by users of a service. For example, every status update, “Like”, photo\nor video shared on Facebook adds to the user’s timeline, retelling the story of one’s past experiences\nand relationships. As users continue to share and interact with information on the service, their digital\nlife is recorded and archived. The collection of memories and experiences, in aggregate, becomes\nmore valuable over time and the service becomes harder to leave as users’ personal investment in the\nsite grows.\nData\nInformation generated, collected or created by users — such as songs, photos, or news clippings —are examples of stored value in the form of content. But sometimes users invest in a service by either\nactively or passively adding data about themselves or their behaviors.\nOn LinkedIn, the user’s online resume embodies the concept of data as stored value. Every time\njob-seekers use the service, they are prompted to add more information. The company found that the\nmore information users invested in the site, the more committed they became to it. As Josh Elman, an\nearly Senior Product Manager at the company told me, “If we could get users to enter just a little\ninformation, they were much more likely to return.” The tiny bit of effort associated with providing\nmore user data created a powerful hook to bring people back to the service.\nMint.com is an online personal finance tool used by millions of Americans. The service aggregates\nall of the user’s accounts in one place, providing a complete picture of their financial life — but only\nif they invest their time and data in the service. Mint provides multiple opportunities for users to\ncustomize the site and make it more valuable with use. For example, the act of linking accounts,\ncategorizing transactions, or creating a budget are all forms of investment. The more data collected,\nthe more the service’s stored value increases (figure 31).\nFigure 31\nFollowers\nOn the morning of Twitter’s IPO on November 7, 2013, a news commentator on Bloomberg’s\ntelevision channel said “the technology needed to build the company could be built in a day.”\n[cvii]\nIn\nfact, he was right. Twitter is a simple application. With a bit of basic programming know-how,\nanyone can build their very own clone of the multi-billion dollar social media behemoth.\nIn fact, several companies have tried to supplant the popular social network. One of the most\nnotable attempts came from a disgruntled developer who decided to build App.net, an ad-free\nalternative that many tech industry watchers argue is actually a better product. But like other attempts\nto copy the service, App.net has not taken off. Why not?\nCollecting people to follow on Twitter, as well as collecting followers, provides tremendous\nvalue and is a key driver of what keeps Twitter users hooked (figure 32).\nFigure 32\nFrom the follower side of the equation, the more Twitter users curate the list of people they follow,\nthe better the service will be at delivering interesting content. Investing in following the right people\nincreases the value of the product by displaying more relevant and interesting content in each user’s\nTwitter feed. It also tells Twitter a lot about its users, which in turn improves the service overall.\nFor the tweeter seeking followers, the more followers one has, the more valuable the service\nbecomes as well. Content creators on Twitter seek to reach as large an audience as possible. The\nonly way to legitimately acquire new followers is to send tweets others think are interesting enough to\nwarrant following the sender. Therefore, to acquire more followers, content creators must invest in\nproducing more — and better — tweets. The cycle increases the value of the service for both sides\nthe more the service is used. For many users, switching services means abandoning years of\ninvestment and starting over. No one wants to rebuild a loyal following they have worked hard to\nacquire and nurture.\nReputation\nReputation is a form of stored value users can literally take to the bank. On online marketplaces such\nas eBay, TaskRabbit, Yelp, and Airbnb, people with negative scores are treated very differently from\nthose with good reputations. It can often be the deciding factor in what price a seller gets for an itemon eBay, who is selected for a TaskRabbit job, which restaurants appear at the top of Yelp search\nresults, and the price of a room rental on Airbnb.\nOn eBay, both buyers and sellers take their reputations very seriously. The e-commerce giant\nsurfaces user-generated quality scores for every buyer and seller, and awards its most active users\nwith badges to symbolize their trustworthiness. Businesses with bad reputations find it difficult, if not\nimpossible, to compete against highly-rated sellers. Reputation is a form of stored value that\nincreases the likelihood of using a service. Whether a buyer or seller, reputation makes users more\nlikely to stick with whichever service they have invested their efforts in to maintain a high quality\nscore (figure 33).\nFigure 33\nSkill\nInvesting time and effort into learning to use a product is a form of investment and stored value. Once\na user has acquired a skill, using the service becomes easier and moves them to the right on the\nAbility axis of the Fogg Behavior Model we discussed in chapter three. As Fogg describes it, nonroutine is a factor of simplicity, and the more familiar a behavior is, the more likely the user is to do\nit.\nFor example, Adobe Photoshop is the most widely-used professional graphics editing program in\nthe world. The software provides hundreds of advanced features for creating and manipulating\nimages. At first, learning the program is difficult, but as users become more familiar with the product\n— often investing hours watching tutorials and reading how-to guides — their expertise and\nefficiency using the product improves. They also achieve a sense of mastery (rewards of the self).\nUnfortunately for the design professional, most of these learnings do not translate to competing\napplications. Once users have invested the effort to acquire a skill, they are less likely to switch to a\ncompeting product.\n***\nLike every phase in the Hook Model, the Investment Phase requires careful use. It is not a carte\nblanche tool for asking users to do onerous tasks. In fact, quite the opposite. Just as in the Action\nPhase described in chapter three, to achieve the intended behavior in the Investment Phase, the\nproduct designer must consider whether users have sufficient motivation and ability to engage in the\nintended behavior. If users are not doing what the designer intended in the Investment Phase, the\ndesigner may be asking them to do too much. I recommend that you progressively stage the investment\nyou want from users into small chunks of work, starting with small, easy tasks and building up to\nharder tasks during successive cycles through the Hook Model.\nAs we have just seen, users store value in the service during the Investment Phase. But one other\nkey opportunity found in the Investment Phase greatly increases the likelihood of users returning.\nLoading the Next Trigger\nAs described in chapter two, triggers bring users back to the product. Ultimately, habit-forming\nproducts create a mental association with an internal trigger. But to create the habit, users must first\nuse the product through multiple cycles of the Hook Model. Therefore, external triggers must be used\nto bring users back around again to start another cycle.\nHabit-forming technologies leverage the user's past behavior to initiate an external trigger in the\nfuture. Users set future triggers during the Investment Phase, providing companies with an opportunity\nto re-engage the user. Next, we will explore a few examples of how companies have helped load the\nnext trigger during the Investment Phase.\nAny.do\nUser retention is a challenge for any business, but especially for consumer mobile applications.\nAccording to a study by a mobile analytics firm, 26 percent of mobile apps in 2010 were downloaded\nand used only once.\n[cviii]\nFurther data suggests people are using more applications but engaging with\nthem less frequently.\n[cix]\nAny.do is a simple mobile task management app used to record to-do items such as picking up dry\ncleaning, restocking the fridge with milk or calling Mom. Recognizing the challenge of retaining\nfickle mobile consumers, the app is designed to direct users to invest early on. During the first use of\nthe app, Any.do elegantly teaches how to use the product (figure 34). The trigger comes in the form of\nthe app’s clear, easy-to-follow instructions. The follow-on action is doing what the app tells the user\nto do. The variable rewards come in the form of a congratulatory message and satisfaction of\nmastering the app.\nThen comes the investment. Newcomers are instructed to connect the app to their calendar service,\ngranting Any.do access to the user’s schedule. In doing so, users give the app permission to send a\nnotification after the next scheduled meeting ends. This external trigger prompts users to return to the\napp to record a follow-up task from the meeting they just attended. In the Any.do scenario, the app\nsends an external trigger to users at the moment when they are most likely to experience the internal\ntrigger of anxiety about forgetting to do a task after a meeting. The Any.do app has anticipated a need\nand sets users up for success.\nFigure 34\nTinder\nIn mid-2013, a hot new company entered the hyper-competitive online dating market. Tinder quickly\ncaptured the attention of millions of people looking for love with a simple interface, generating 3.5\nmillion matches from 350 million swipes each day.\n[cx] After launching the mobile app and logging-in\nwith Facebook, users browse profiles of other singles. Each potential match is presented as a card.\nSwipe left if you are not interested and right if that special someone catches your fancy (figure 35). If\nboth parties express interest, a match is made and a private chat connects the two potential lovebirds.\nBy simplifying the investment of sorting through potential mates, Tinder makes loading the next\ntrigger more likely with each swipe. The more swipes, the more potential matches are made and of\ncourse, each match sends notifications to both interested parties.\nFigure 35\nSnapchat\nAs of June 2013, a popular photo sharing app called Snapchat boasted of five million daily active\nusers collectively sending over 200 million photos and videos daily.\n[cxi] This tremendous engagement\nmeans an average Snapchat user sends 40 pics every day!\nBut why are users so in love with Snapchat? In large part, its success can be attributed to the fact\nthat users load the next trigger every time they use the service. Snapchat is more than a way to share\nimages. It is a means of communication akin to sending an SMS message — with the added bonus of a\nbuilt-in timer that can cause the message to self-destruct after viewing, based on the sender’s\ninstructions. Users pass through the Investment Phase of the Hook Model each time they send a selfie,\ndoodle, or goofy photo. Each photo or video sent contains an implicit prompt to respond and the\nSnapchat interface makes returning a pic incredibly easy by double tapping the original message to\nreply. The self-destruct feature encourages timely responses, leading to a back-and-forth relay that\nkeeps people hooked into the service by loading the next trigger with each message sent.\nPinterest\nLike many social networks, Pinterest loads the next trigger during the Investment Phase of the hook.\nFor many of the site’s 50 million monthly users, the online pinboard replaced the habit of browsing\nfashion-focused websites — and before the web, flipping through magazines and dog-earing favorite\npages.\n[cxii]\nThe internal trigger for users is often boredom, for which the site offers a quick cure. Once\nregistered, the only action required of users is to start scrolling as Pinterest showcases a wealth of\nvariable rewards. First, because Pinterest is a socially-curated collection of interesting items, the site\ndisplays a powerful intermittent reward surrounding the hunt for objects of desire, even if they are\nonly images. The site also provides a means of communicating with friends and people who share\nsimilar tastes. The Rewards of the Tribe come from the variability of posting images as a\ncommunication medium. A user might be curious to know what a friend has pinned not only because\nof the image itself, but because of her relationship with the pinner.\nFinally, Pinterest users invest in the site every time they pin an image of their own, re-pin someone\nelse’s image, comment on, or like a piece of content on the site (figure 36). Each of these tiny\ninvestments gives Pinterest data it can use to tailor the site to each user’s individual taste, it also\nloads the next trigger. Each pin, re-pin, like, or comment gives Pinterest tacit permission to reach\nback out to the user with a notification when someone else contributes to the thread, triggering the\ndesire to visit the site again to learn more.\nFigure 36\n***\nPinterest clearly demonstrates the four stages of the Hook Model. It is a seamless flow, from the itch\nof the internal trigger that moves users to the intended action, through the variable reward, and finally\nto the investment, which also loads the next external trigger. Pinterest users move through the Hook\ncycle from beginning to end, and then happily return to the starting point for another go ‘round.\nIn this chapter, we have learned how an investment in the product serves as the string that pulls the\nuser back. To do this, the habit-forming technology increases the value of the product with each pass\nthrough the Hook. Through successive cycles of the Hook Model, users increase their affinity for the\nexperience. They increasingly come to rely on the product as the solution to their problems until\nfinally, the new habit — and routine — is formed.\nThe more users invest in a product through tiny bits of work, the more valuable the product\nbecomes in their lives and the less they question its use. Of course, users do not stay hooked forever.\nInvariably, the next big thing will come along and provide a better, more compelling hook. However,\nby creating habits fueled by investments in a product or service, companies make switching to a\ncompetitor difficult. User habits are hard to break and confer powerful competitive advantages to any\ncompany fortunate enough to successfully create them.\n***\nRemember and Share\n- The Investment Phase is the fourth step in the Hook Model.\n- Unlike the Action Phase, which delivers immediate gratification, the Investment Phase is\nabout the anticipation of rewards in the future.\n- Investments in a product create preference because of our tendency to overvalue our work, be\nconsistent with past behaviors, and avoid cognitive dissonance.\n- Investment comes after the variable reward phase when users are primed to reciprocate.\n- Investments increase the likelihood of users returning by improving the service the more it is\nused. They enable the accrual of stored value in the form of content, data, followers, reputation or\nskill.\n- Investments increase the likelihood of users passing through the Hook again by loading the\nnext trigger to start the cycle all over again.\n***\nDo This Now\nRefer to the answers you came up with in the last “Do This Now” section to complete the following\nexercises:\n- Review your flow. What “bit of work” are your users doing to increase their likelihood of\nreturning?\n- Brainstorm three ways to add small investments into your product to:\n- Load the next trigger\n- Store value as data, content, followers, reputation and skill\n- Identify how long it takes for a “loaded trigger” to re-engage your users. How can you reduce\nthe delay to shorten cycle-time through the Hook?\n6. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH THIS?\nThe Hook Model is designed to connect the user’s problem with the designer’s solution frequently\nenough to form a habit. It is a framework for building products that solve user needs through longterm engagement.\nAs users pass through cycles of The Hook Model, they learn to meet their needs with the habitforming product. Effective hooks transition users from relying upon external triggers to cueing mental\nassociations with internal triggers. Users move from states of low engagement to high engagement and\nfrom low preference to high preference.\nYou are now equipped to use the Hook Model to ask yourself these five fundamental questions for\nbuilding effective hooks:\n1. What do users really want? What pain is your product relieving?\n(Internal Trigger)\n2. What brings users to your service? (External Trigger)\n3. What is the simplest action users take in anticipation of reward, and\nhow can you simplify your product to make this action easier? (Action)\n4. Are users fulfilled by the reward, yet left wanting more? (Variable\nReward)\n5. What “bit of work” do users invest in your product? Does it load the\nnext trigger and store value to improve the product with use?\n(Investment)\n***\nThe Morality of Manipulation\nSo now what? Now that you’re aware of the pattern for building habit-forming technology, how will\nyou use this knowledge?\nPerhaps while reading this book you asked yourself if the Hook Model is a recipe for\nmanipulation. Maybe you felt a bit unsettled reading what seemed like a cookbook for mind control. If\nso, that is a very good thing.\nThe Hook Model is fundamentally about changing people’s behaviors; but the power to build\npersuasive products should be used with caution. Creating habits can be a force for good, but it can\nalso be used for nefarious purposes. What responsibility do product makers have when creating user\nhabits?\nLet’s admit it, we are all in the persuasion business.\n[cxiii] Technologists build products meant to\npersuade people to do what we want them to do. We call these people “users” and even if we don’t\nsay it aloud, we secretly wish every one of them would become fiendishly hooked to whatever we’re\nmaking. I’m guessing that’s likely why you started reading this book.\nUsers take their technologies with them to bed.\n[cxiv] When they wake up, they check for notifications,\ntweets, and updates, sometimes even before saying “Good morning” to their loved ones. Ian Bogost,\nthe famed game creator and professor, calls the wave of habit-forming technologies the “cigarette of\nthis century” and warns of their equally addictive and potentially destructive side-effects.\n[cxv]\nYou may be asking, “When is it wrong to manipulate users?”\nManipulation is an experience crafted to change behavior — we all know what it feels like. We’re\nuncomfortable when we sense someone is trying to make us do something we wouldn’t do otherwise,\nlike when sitting through a car salesman’s spiel or hearing a timeshare presentation.\nYet, manipulation doesn’t always have a negative connotation. If it did, how could we explain the\nnumerous multi-billion-dollar industries that rely heavily on users being willingly manipulated?\nIf manipulation is an experience crafted to change behavior, then Weight Watchers, one of the most\nsuccessful mass-manipulation products in history, fits the definition.\n[cxvi] Weight Watchers customers’\ndecisions are programmed by the designer of the system. Yet, few question the morality of the\nbusiness.\nBut what is the difference? Why is manipulating users through flashy advertising or addictive video\ngames thought to be distasteful while a strict system of food rationing is considered laudable? While\nmany people see Weight Watchers as an acceptable form of user manipulation, our moral compass\nhas not caught up with what the latest technology now makes possible.\nUbiquitous access to the web, transferring greater amounts of personal data at faster speeds than\never before, has created a more potentially addictive world. According to famed Silicon Valley\ninvestor Paul Graham, we haven’t had time to develop societal “antibodies to addictive new\nthings.”\n[cxvii] Graham places responsibility on the user: “Unless we want to be canaries in the coal mine\nof each new addiction — the people whose sad example becomes a lesson to future generations —we’ll have to figure out for ourselves what to avoid and how.”\nBut what of the people who make these manipulative experiences? After all, the corporations that\nunleash these habit-forming, and at times addictive, technologies are made up of human beings with a\nmoral sense of right and wrong. They too have families and kids who are susceptible to manipulation.\nWhat shared responsibilities do we growth-hackers and behavior-designers have to our users, to\nfuture generations, and to ourselves?\nWith the increasing pervasiveness and persuasiveness of personal technology, some industry\ninsiders have proposed creating an ethical code of conduct.\n[cxviii] Others believe differently: Chris\nNodder, author of the book Evil by Design, writes “... it’s OK to deceive people if it’s in their best\ninterests, or if they’ve given implicit consent to be deceived as part of a persuasive strategy.”\n[cxix]\nI offer a simple decision support tool entrepreneurs, employees, and investors can use long before\nproduct is shipped or code is written. The Manipulation Matrix does not try to answer which\nbusinesses are moral or which will succeed, nor does it describe what can and can not become a\nhabit-forming technology. The matrix seeks to help you answer not, “Can I hook my users?” but\ninstead, “Should I attempt to?”\nTo use the Manipulation Matrix (figure 36), the maker needs to ask two questions. First, “Would I\nuse the product myself?” and second, “Will the product help users materially improve their lives?”\nFigure 36\nRemember, this framework is for creating habit-forming products, not one-time use goods. Now,\nlet’s explore the types of creators who represent the four quadrants of the Manipulation Matrix.\nThe Facilitator\nWhen you create something that you would use and that you believe makes the user’s life better, you\nare facilitating a healthy habit. It is important to note that only you can decide if you would actually\nuse the product or service, and what “materially improving the life of the user” really means in light\nof what you are creating.\nIf you find yourself squirming as you ask yourself these questions or needing to qualify or justify\nyour answers, STOP! You failed. You have to actually want to use the product and believe it\nmaterially benefits your life as well as the lives of your users.\nOne exception is if you would have been a user in your younger years. For example, in the case of\nan education company, you may not need to use the service right now, but are certain you would have\nused it in your not-so-distant past. Note however that the further you are from your former self, the\nlower your odds of success.\nIn building a habit for a user other than yourself, you can not consider yourself a facilitator unless\nyou have experienced the problem first-hand.\nJake Harriman grew up on a small farm in West Virginia. After graduating from the U.S. Naval\nAcademy, Harriman served as an Infantry and Special Operations Platoon Commander in the Marine\nCorps. He was in Iraq during the 2003 invasion and led men into fierce gun battles with enemy\ncombatants. Later, he assisted with disaster relief in Indonesia and Sri Lanka after the 2004 Asian\ntsunami.\nHarriman says his encounter with extreme poverty abroad changed his life. After seven and a half\nyears of active duty, Harriman realized that guns alone could not stop terrorists intent on harming\nAmericans. “Desperate people commit desperate acts,” Harriman says. After his service, Harriman\nfounded Nuru International, a social venture targeting extreme poverty by changing the habits of\npeople living in rural areas.\nHowever, exactly how Harriman would change the lives of the poorest people in the world was\nnot clear to him until he decided to live among them. In Kenya, he discovered that basic practices of\nmodern agriculture — like proper seed spacing — were still not used. But Harriman knew that\nsimply teaching farmers new behaviors would not be enough.\nInstead, by drawing upon his own rural upbringing and experience living with the farmers,\nHarriman uncovered the obstacles in their way. He soon learned that the lack of access to financing\nfor high quality seeds and fertilizer kept farmers from utilizing yield-boosting techniques.\nToday, Nuru is equipping farmers in Kenya and Ethiopia, helping them rise out of grinding poverty.\nIt was only by becoming one of his users that Harriman could design solutions to meet their needs.\n[cxx]\nAlthough it is a long way from Africa to Silicon Valley, the well-documented stories of the\nfounders of Facebook and Twitter reveal they would likely see themselves as making products in the\nfacilitator quadrant. Today, a new breed of companies is creating products to improve lives by\ncreating healthy habits. Whether getting users to exercise more, creating a habit of journaling, or\nimproving back posture, these companies are run by authentic entrepreneurs who desperately want\ntheir products to exist, firstly to satisfy their own needs.\nBut what if the usage of a well-intended product becomes extreme, even harmful? What about the\nusers who go beyond forming habits, becoming full-fledged addicts?\nFirst, it is important to recognize that the percentage of users who form a detrimental dependency is\nvery small. Industry estimates for pathological users of even the most habit-forming technologies,\nsuch as slot machines gambling, are just one percent.\n[cxxi] Addiction tends to manifest in people with a\nparticular psychological profile. However, simply brushing off the issue as too small to matter\ndismisses the very real problems caused by technology addiction.\nFor the first time, however, companies have access to data that could be used to flag which users\nare using their products too much. Whether companies choose to act on that data in a way that aids\ntheir users is, of course, a question of corporate responsibility. Companies building habit-forming\ntechnologies have a moral obligation — and perhaps someday a legal mandate — to inform and\nprotect users who are forming unhealthy attachments to their products. It would behoove\nentrepreneurs building potentially addictive products to set guidelines for identifying and helping\naddicted users.\nHowever, for the overwhelming majority of users, addiction to a product will never be a problem.\nEven though the world is becoming a potentially more addictive place, most people have the ability\nto self-regulate their behaviors.\nThe role of facilitator fulfills the moral obligation for entrepreneurs building a product they will\nuse, and which they believe materially improves the lives of others. As long as they have procedures\nin place to assist those who form unhealthy addictions, the designer can act with a clean conscience.\nTo take liberties with Mahatma Gandhi’s famous quote, facilitators “build the change they want to see\nin the world.”\nThe Peddler\nHeady altruistic ambitions can at times outpace reality. Too often, designers of manipulative\ntechnology have a strong motivation to improve the lives of their users, but when pressed, they admit\nthey would not actually use their own creations. Their holier-than-thou products often try to “gamify”\nsome task no one actually wants to do by inserting run-of-the-mill incentives such as badges or points\nthat don’t actually hold value for their users.\nFitness apps, charity websites, and products that claim to suddenly turn hard work into fun often\nfall in this quadrant. But possibly the most common example of peddlers is in advertising.\nCountless companies convince themselves they’re making ad campaigns users will love. They\nexpect their videos to go viral and their branded apps to be used daily. Their so-called “reality\ndistortion fields” keep them from asking the critical question, “Would I actually find this useful?”\n[cxxii]\nThe answer to this uncomfortable question is nearly always “No,” so they twist their thinking until\nthey can imagine a user they believe might find the ad valuable.\nMaterially improving users’ lives is a tall order, and attempting to create a persuasive technology\nthat you do not use yourself is incredibly difficult. This puts designers at a heavy disadvantage\nbecause of their disconnect with their products and users. There’s nothing immoral about peddling; in\nfact, many companies working on solutions for others do so out of purely altruistic reasons. It’s just\nthat the odds of successfully designing products for a customer you don’t know extremely well are\ndepressingly low. Peddlers tend to lack the empathy and insights needed to create something users\nactually want. Often the peddler's project results in a time-wasting failure because the designers did\nnot fully understand their users. As a result, no one finds the product useful.\nThe Entertainer\nSometimes product-makers just want to have fun. If creators of a potentially addictive technology\nmake something that they use but can’t in good conscience claim improves users’ lives, they’re\nmaking entertainment.\nEntertainment is art and is important for its own sake. Art provides joy, helps us see the world\ndifferently, and connects us with the human condition. These are all important and age-old pursuits.\nEntertainment, however, has particular attributes of which the entrepreneur, employee, and investor\nshould be aware when using the Manipulation Matrix.\nArt is often fleeting; products that form habits around entertainment tend to fade quickly from users’\nlives. A hit song, repeated over and over again in the mind, becomes nostalgia after it is replaced by\nthe next chart-topper. A book like this one is read and thought about for a while until the next\ninteresting piece of brain candy comes along. As we learned in the chapter on variable rewards,\ngames like FarmVille and Angry Birds engross users, but then are relegated to the gaming dustbin\nalong with other hyper-addictive has-beens such as Pac Man and Mario Bros.\nEntertainment is a hits-driven business because the brain reacts to stimulus by wanting more and\nmore of it, ever hungry for continuous novelty. Building an enterprise on ephemeral desires is akin to\nrunning on an incessantly rolling treadmill: You have to keep up with the constantly changing\ndemands of your users. In this quadrant, the sustainable business is not purely the game, the song, or\nthe book — profit comes from an effective distribution system for getting those goods to market while\nthey’re still hot, and at the same time keeping the pipeline full of fresh releases to feed an eager\naudience.\nThe Dealer\nCreating a product that the designer does not believe improves users’ lives and that he himself would\nnot use is called exploitation. In the absence of these two criteria, presumably the only reason the\ndesigner is hooking users is to make a buck. Certainly there is money to be made addicting users to\nbehaviors that do little more than extract cash; and where there is cash, there will be someone willing\nto take it.\nThe question is: Is that someone you? Casinos and drug dealers offer users a good time, but when\nthe addiction takes hold, the fun stops.\nIn a satirical take on Zynga’s FarmVille franchise, Ian Bogost created Cow Clicker, a Facebook\napp where users did nothing but incessantly click on virtual cows to hear a satisfying “moo.”\n[cxxiii]\nBogost intended to lampoon FarmVille by blatantly implementing the same game mechanics and viral\nhacks he thought would be laughably obvious to users. But after the app’s usage exploded and some\npeople became frighteningly obsessed with the game, Bogost shut it down, bringing on what he called\n“The Cowpocalypse.”\n[cxxiv]\nBogost rightfully compared addictive technology to cigarettes. Certainly, the incessant need for a\nsmoke in what was once a majority of the adult U.S. population has been replaced by a nearly equal\ncompulsion to constantly check our devices. But unlike the addiction to nicotine, new technologies\noffer an opportunity to dramatically improve users’ lives. Like all technologies, recent advances in\nthe habit-forming potential of digital innovation have both positive and negative effects.\nBut if the innovator has a clear conscience that the product materially improves people’s lives —\nfirst among them, the designer’s — then the only path is to push forward. With the exception of the\naddicted one percent, users bear ultimate responsibility for their actions.\nHowever, as the march of technology makes the world a potentially more addictive place,\ninnovators need to consider their role. It will be years, perhaps generations, before society develops\nthe mental antibodies to control new habits; in the meantime, many of these behaviors may develop\nharmful side-effects. For now, users must learn to assess these yet-unknown consequences for\nthemselves, while creators will have to live with the moral repercussions of how they spend their\nprofessional lives.\nMy hope is that the Manipulation Matrix helps innovators consider the implications of the products\nthey create. Perhaps after reading this book, you’ll start a new business. Maybe you’ll join an existing\ncompany with a mission to which you are committed. Or, perhaps you will decide it is time to quit\nyour job because you’ve come to realize it no longer points in the same direction as your moral\ncompass.\n***\nRemember and Share\n- To help designers of habit-forming technology assess the morality behind how they manipulate\nusers, it is helpful to determine which of the four categories their work fits into. Are you a\nfacilitator, peddler, entertainer, or dealer?\n- Facilitators use their own product and believe it can materially improve people’s lives. They\nhave the highest chance of success because they most closely understand the needs of their users.\n- Peddlers believe their product can materially improve people’s lives, but do not use it\nthemselves. They must beware of the hubris and inauthenticity that comes from building solutions\nfor people they do not understand.\n- Entertainers use their product, but do not believe it can improve people’s lives. They can be\nsuccessful, but without making the lives of others better in some way, the entertainer’s products\noften lack staying power.\n- Dealers neither use the product nor believe it can improve people’s lives. They have the lowest\nchance of finding long-term success and often find themselves in morally precarious positions.\n***\nDo This Now\n- Take a minute to consider where you fall on the Manipulation Matrix. Do you use your own\nproduct or service? Does it influence positive or negative behaviors? How does it make you feel?\nAsk yourself if you are proud of the way you are influencing the behavior of others.\n\n7. CASE STUDY: THE BIBLE APP\nIn the previous chapter, I urged you to be a facilitator and to use the tools in this book to improve the\nlives of others. I encouraged you to align your work with a purpose that provides you with meaning\nand helps cultivate meaning for others. This is not only a moral imperative, it’s good business\npractice.\nThe most highly regarded entrepreneurs are driven by meaning, a vision for greater good that\ndrives them forward. Startups are grueling and only the most fortunate persevere before finding\nsuccess. If you only build for fame or fortune, you will likely find neither. But build for meaning and\nyou can’t go wrong.\nThe Hook Model is a framework based on human psychology and a close examination of today’s\nmost successful habit-forming products. Now that you have an understanding of the model and the\npsychology behind why we do the things we do, let’s study how it all comes together in one of the\nworld’s most popular apps. Whether you agree with the mission of the app described below is not\nimportant. The lesson here is how a technology company created a user habit while staying true to the\nfounder’s moral calling.\nIt’s not often an app has the power to keep someone out of a strip club. But according to Bobby\nGruenewald, CEO of YouVersion, that’s exactly what his technology did. Gruenewald says a user of\nhis Bible verse app walked into a business of ill repute when suddenly, seemingly out of the heavens,\nhe received a notification on his phone. “God’s trying to tell me something!,” Gruenewald recalled\nthe user saying. “I just walked into a strip club — and man — the Bible just texted me!”\nIn July 2013, YouVersion announced a monumental milestone for the app, placing it in a rare strata\nof technology companies. The app, simply called “Bible,” has been downloaded to more than 100\nmillion devices and growing.\n[cxxv] Gruenewald says a new install occurs every 1.3 seconds.\nOn average, 66,000 people open the app every second — and sometimes the open rate is much\nhigher. Every Sunday, Gruenewald says, preachers around the world tell congregants to “take out\nyour Bibles or YouVersion app. And, we see a huge spike.”\nThe market for religious apps is fiercely competitive. Searching for “Bible” in the Apple App\nStore returns 5,185 results. But among all the choices, YouVersion’s Bible seems to be the chosen\none, ranking at the top of the list and boasting over 641,000 reviews.\nHow did YouVersion come to dominate the digital, “word of God?” It turns out there is much more\nbehind the app’s success than missionary zeal. It’s a case study in how technology can change\nbehavior by marrying the principles of consumer psychology with the latest in big data analytics.\nAccording to industry insiders, the YouVersion Bible could be worth a bundle. Jules Maltz,\nGeneral Partner at Institutional Venture Partners, told me, “As a rule of thumb, a company this size\ncould be worth $200 million and up.”\nMaltz should know. His firm announced an investment in another pre-revenue app, Snapchat, at an\n$800 million valuation in July 2013.\n[cxxvi] Maltz justifies the price by pointing to the per-user valuations\nof other tech companies such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, each of which commanded\nastronomical investment sums well before turning a profit. Maltz was quick to add, “Of course, this\nassumes the company can monetize through advertising.”\nIn the Beginning\nGruenewald is a quick-thinking, fast-talking man. During our conversation, he pulled up statistics in\nreal-time, stopping himself mid-sentence whenever relevant data flashed on his screen. As\nGruenewald preaches on about mobile app development best practices, I need to occasionally\ninterrupt him to ask clarifying questions. My words stumble over his enthusiasm as he bears witness\nto what he’s learned building his app. He spouts user retention figures with the same gusto I’d\nimagine he might proclaim scripture.\n“Unlike other companies, when we started, we were not building a Bible reader for seminary\nstudents. YouVersion was designed to be used by everyone, every day,” Gruenewald says, attributing\nmuch of the app’s success to a relentless focus on creating habitual Bible readers. The Bible app’s\nsuccess is broken down into the language of habit formation more commonly seen in psychology\ntextbooks. The “cues,” “behaviors” and “rewards” of communing with the Lord are bullet-pointed\nand ready for our discussion.\n“Bible study guides are nothing new,” Gruenewald says. “People have been using them with pen\nand paper long before we came along.” But I soon find out, the Bible app is much more than a mobile\nstudy guide.\nIn fact, the first version of YouVersion was not mobile at all. “We originally started as a desktop\nwebsite, but that really didn’t engage people in the Bible. It wasn’t until we tried a mobile version\nthat we noticed a difference in people, including ourselves, turning to the Bible more because it was\non a device they always had with them.”\nThis is not surprising. The Fogg Behavior Model (chapter three) notes that for an action to occur,\nusers must receive a trigger and have sufficient motivation and ability to complete it. If any of these\nelements are missing or inadequate at the moment the trigger arises, the action will not occur.\nThe omnipresence of the Bible app makes it far more accessible than its website predecessor,\ngiving users the ability to open the mobile app when triggered by the pastor’s instructions or when\nfeeling inspired at other moments throughout their day. Its users take it everywhere, reading the\nscripture in even the most unsanctified places. The company revealed that 18 percent of readers\nreport using the Bible app in the bathroom.\n[cxxvii]\nHow to Form a God Habit\nGruenewald acknowledges his Bible app enjoyed the good fortune of being among the first of its kind\nat the genesis of the App Store in 2008. To take advantage of the newly established App Store,\nGruenewald quickly converted his website into a mobile app optimized for reading. The app caught\nthe rising tide, but soon a wave of competition followed. If his app was to reign supreme,\nGruenewald needed to get users hooked quickly.\nThat’s when Gruenewald says he implemented a plan — actually, many plans. A signature of the\nBible app is its selection of over 400 reading plans — a devotional iTunes of sorts, catering to an\naudience with diverse tastes, troubles, and tongues. Given my personal interest and research into\nhabit-forming technology, I decided to start a Bible reading plan of my own. A plan titled\n“Addictions” seemed appropriate.\nFor those who have yet to form a routine around Biblical study, reading plans provide structure and\nguidance. “Certain sections of the Bible can be difficult for people to get through,” Gruenewald\nadmits. “By offering reading plans with different small sections of the Bible each day, it helps keep\n[readers] from giving up.”\nThe app chunks out and sequences the text by separating it into bite-sized pieces. By parsing\nreadings into digestible communion wafer-sized portions, the app focuses the reader’s brain on the\nsmall task at hand while avoiding the intimidation of reading the entire book.\nHoly Triggers\nFive years of testing and tinkering have helped Gruenewald’s team discover what works best. Today,\nthe Bible app’s reading plans are tuned to immaculate perfection and Gruenewald has learned that\nfrequency of use is paramount. “We’ve always focused on daily reading. Our entire structure for\nplans focuses on daily engagement.”\nTo get users to open the app every day, Gruenewald makes sure he sends effective cues — like the\nnotification sent to the sinner in the strip club. But Gruenewald admits he stumbled upon the power of\ngood triggers. “At first we were very worried about sending people notifications. We didn’t want to\nbother them too much.”\nTo test how much of a cross users were willing to bear, Gruenewald decided to run an experiment.\n“For Christmas, we sent people a message from the app. Just a ‘Merry Christmas’ in various\nlanguages.” The team was prepared to hear from disgruntled users annoyed by the message. “We\nwere afraid people would uninstall the app,” Gruenewald says. “But just the opposite happened.\nPeople took pictures of the notification on their phones and started sharing them on Instagram, Twitter\nand Facebook. They felt God was reaching out to them.” Today, Gruenewald says, triggers play an\nimportant role in every reading plan.\nOn my own plan, I receive a daily notification — an owned external trigger — on my phone. It\nsimply says, “Don’t forget to read your Addictions reading plan.” Ironically, the addiction I’m trying\nto cure is my dependency on digital gadgetry, but what the hell, I’ll fall off the wagon just this once.\nIn case I somehow avoid the first message, a red badge over a tiny Holy Bible icon on my phone\ncues me again. If I forget to start the first day of a plan, I’ll receive a message suggesting that perhaps\nI should try a different, less-challenging plan. I also have the option of receiving verse through email.\nAnd if I slip up and miss a few days, another email reminds me to get back on track.\nThe Bible app also comes with a virtual congregation of sorts. Members of the site tend to send\nencouraging words to one another, delivering even more triggers. According to the company’s\npublicist, “Community emails can serve as a nudge to open the app.” These relationship-based\nexternal triggers are everywhere in the Bible app and are one of the keys to keeping users engaged.\nGlory Be in the Data\nGruenewald’s team sifts through behavioral data collected from millions of readers to better\nunderstand what users want from the app. “We just have so much data flowing through our system,”\nGruenewald says. The data reveals important insights on what drives user retention. High on the list\nof learnings is the importance of “ease of use,” which came up throughout our conversation.\nIn line with the work of psychologists from early Gestalt psychologist Kurt Lewin to modern-day\nresearchers, the app uses the principle that by making an intended action easier to do, people will do\nit more often.\nThe Bible app is designed to make absorbing the Word as frictionless as possible. For example, to\nmake the Bible app habit easier to adopt, users who prefer listening over reading can simply tap a\nsmall icon to play an audio track read with the dramatic bravado of Charlton Heston himself.\nGruenewald says his data also revealed that changing the order of the Bible by placing the more\ninteresting sections up-front and saving the boring bits for later increased completion rates.\nFurthermore, daily reading plans are kept to a simple inspirational thought and a few short verses for\nnewcomers. The idea is to get neophytes into the ritual for a few minutes each day until the routine\nbecomes a facet of their everyday lives.\nRewards from the Lord\nGruenewald says the connection people have with scripture taps into deep emotions that “we need to\nuse responsibly.” Readers who form a habit of using the app turn to it not only when they see a\nnotification on their phone, but also whenever they feel low and need a way to lift their spirits.\n“We believe that the Bible is a way God speaks to us,” Gruenewald says. “When people see a\nverse, they see wisdom or truth they can apply to their lives or a situation they’re going through.”\nSkeptics might call this “subjective validation,” and psychologists call it the “Forer Effect,” but to the\nfaithful, it amounts to personally communicating with God.\nUpon opening the Bible app, I find a specially selected verse waiting for me on the topic of\n“Addictions.” With just two taps I’m reading 1 Thessalonians 5:11 — encouragement for the\n“children of the day,” imploring them with the words, “let us be sober.” It’s easy to see how these\ncomforting words could serve as a sort of prize wrapped inside the app, helping readers feel better.\nGruenewald says his Bible app also offers an element of mystery and variability. “One woman\nwould stay up until just past midnight to know what verse she had received for her next day,”\nGruenewald says. The unknown — in this case, which verse will be chosen for the reader and how it\nrelates to their personal struggle — becomes an important driver of the reading habit.\nAs for my own reward, after finishing my verse, I received affirmation from a satisfying ”Day\nComplete!” screen. A check mark appeared near the scripture I had read and another one was placed\non my reading plan calendar. Skipping a day would mean breaking the chain of checked days,\nemploying what psychologists call the “endowed progress effect” — a tactic also used by video game\ndesigners to encourage progression.\nAs habit-forming as the Bible app’s reading plans can be, they are not for everyone. In fact,\nGruenewald reports most users downloaded the app but never register for an account with\nYouVersion. Millions choose to not follow any plan, opting instead to use the app as a substitute for\ntheir paper Bibles. But to Gruenewald, using the app in this way suits him fine. Unregistered readers\nare still helping to grow the app. In fact, social media is abuzz with the 200,000 pieces of content\nshared from the app every 24-hours.\nTo help the app spread, a new verse greets the reader on the first page. Below the verse, a large\nblue button reads, “Share Verse of the Day.” One click and the daily scripture is blasted to Facebook\nor Twitter.\nThe drivers behind recently read scripture have not been widely studied. However, one reason\nmay be the reward portraying oneself in a positive light, also known as the “humblebrag.”\n[cxxviii] A\nHarvard meta-analysis entitled “Disclosing information about the self is intrinsically rewarding”\nfound the act, “engages neural and cognitive mechanisms associated with reward.”\n[cxxix]\nIn fact, sharing\nfeels so good that one study found “individuals were willing to forgo money to disclose about the\nself.”\nThere are many opportunities to share verse from within the Bible app, but one of Gruenewald’s\nmost effective distribution channels is not online but in-row — that is, in the pews where churchgoers sit side by side every week.\n“People tell each other about the app because they use it surrounded by people who ask about it,”\nGruenewald says. The app always sees a spike in new downloads on Sundays when people are most\nlikely to share it through word of mouth.\nHowever, nothing signals the reign of Gruenewald’s Bible app quite like the way some preachers\nhave come to depend upon it. YouVersion lets religious leaders input their sermons into the app so\ntheir congregants can follow along in real-time — book, verse, and passage — all without flipping a\npage. Once the head of the church is hooked, the congregation is sure to follow.\nUsing the Bible app at church not only has the benefit of driving growth, it also builds commitment.\nEvery time users highlight a verse, add a comment, create a bookmark or share from the app, they\ninvest in it.\nAs described in an earlier chapter, Dan Ariely and Michael Norton have shown the effect small\namounts of work have on the way people value various products. This “IKEA effect” illustrates the\nconnection between labor and perceived worth.\nIt is reasonable to think that the more readers put into the Bible app in the form of small\ninvestments, the more it becomes a repository of their history of worship. Like a dog-eared book, full\nof scribbled insights and wisdom, the app becomes a treasured asset that won’t easily be discarded.\nThe more readers use the Bible app, the more valuable it becomes to them. Switching to a different\ndigital Bible — God forbid — becomes less likely with each new revelation users type into (or\nextract from) the app, further securing YouVersion’s dominion.\nGruenewald claims he is not in competition with anyone, but he does on occasion rattle off the App\nStore categories where his app holds a high ranking. His app’s place at the top of the charts appears\nsecure now that the Bible has crossed its 100 millionth install. But Gruenewald plans to continue\nsifting through the terabytes of data in search of new ways to increase the reach of his app and make\nhis version of the Bible even more habit-forming. To its tens of millions of regular users,\nGruenewald’s app is a Godsend.\n***\nRemember and Share\n- The Bible app was far less engaging as a desktop website. The mobile interface increased\naccessibility and usage by providing frequent triggers.\n- The Bible app increases users' ability to take action by front-loading interesting content and\nproviding an alternative audio version.\n- By separating the verses into small chunks, users find the Bible easier to read on a daily basis.\nNot knowing what the next verse will be adds a variable reward.\n- Every annotation, bookmark and highlight stores data (and value) in the app, further\ncommitting users.\n8. HABIT TESTING AND WHERE TO LOOK FOR HABIT-FORMING OPPORTUNITIES\nNow that you have an understanding of the Hook Model and have reflected on the morality of\ninfluencing user behavior, it is time to get to work. Running your idea through the four phases of the\nmodel will help you discover potential weaknesses in your product’s habit-forming potential.\nDoes your users’ internal trigger frequently prompt them to action? Is your external trigger cueing\nthem when they are most likely to act? Is your design simple enough to make taking the action easy?\nDoes the reward satisfy your users’ need while leaving them wanting more? Do your users invest a\nbit of work in the product, storing value to improve the experience with use and loading the next\ntrigger?\nBy identifying where your technology is lacking, you can focus on developing improvements to\nyour product where it matters most.\nHabit Testing\nBy following the “Do This Now” sections in previous chapters, you should have enough knowledge\nto prototype your product. But simply coming up with ideas is not enough, and creating user habits is\noften easier said than done. The process of developing successful habit-forming technologies requires\npatience and persistence. The Hook Model can be a helpful tool for filtering out bad ideas with low\nhabit potential as well as a framework for identifying room for improvement in existing products.\nHowever, after the designer has formulated new hypotheses, there is no way to know which ideas\nwill work without testing them with actual users.\nBuilding a habit-forming product is an iterative process and requires user behavior analysis and\ncontinuous experimentation. How can you implement the concepts in this book to measure your\nproduct’s effectiveness building user habits?\nThrough my studies and discussions with entrepreneurs at today’s most successful habit-forming\ncompanies, I’ve distilled this process into what I call “Habit Testing.” It is a process inspired by the\nbuild-measure-learn methodology championed by the lean startup movement. Habit Testing offers\ninsights and actionable data to inform the design of habit-forming products. It helps clarify who your\ndevotees are, what parts of your product are habit-forming (if any), and why those aspects of your\nproduct are changing user behavior.\nHabit Testing does not always require a live product; however, it can be difficult to draw clear\nconclusions without a comprehensive view of how people are using your system. The following steps\nassume you have a product, users, and meaningful data to explore.\nStep 1: Identify\nThe initial question for Habit Testing is “Who are the product’s habitual users?” Remember, the more\nfrequently your product is used, the more likely it is to form a user habit.\nFirst, define what it means to be a devoted user. How often “should” one use your product? The\nanswer to this question is very important and can widely change your perspective. Publicly available\ndata from similar products or solutions can help define your users and engagement targets. If data is\nnot available, educated assumptions must be made — but be realistic and honest.\nIf you are building a social networking app like Twitter or Instagram, you should expect habitual\nusers to visit the service multiple times per day. On the other hand, you should not expect users of a\nmovie recommendation site like Rotten Tomatoes to visit more than once or twice a week (since their\nvisits will come on the heels of seeing a movie or researching one to watch). Don’t come up with an\noverly aggressive prediction that only accounts for uber-users; you are looking for a realistic guess to\ncalibrate how often typical users will interact with your product.\nOnce you know how often users should use your product, dig into the numbers and identify how\nmany and which type of users meet this threshold. As a best practice, use cohort analysis to measure\nchanges in user behavior through future product iterations.\nStep 2: Codify\nHopefully you’ve identified a few users who meet the criteria of habitual users. But how many users\nare enough? My rule of thumb is five percent. Though your rate of active users will need to be much\nhigher to sustain your business, this is a good initial benchmark.\nHowever, if at least five percent of your users don’t find your product valuable enough to use as\nmuch as you predicted they would, you may have a problem. Either you identified the wrong users or\nyour product needs to go back to the drawing board. But if you have exceeded that bar and identified\nyour habitual users, the next step is to codify the steps they took using your product to understand what\nhooked them.\nUsers will interact with your product in slightly different ways. Even if you have a standard user\nflow, the way users engage with your product creates a unique fingerprint. Where users are coming\nfrom, decisions made when registering, and the number of friends using the service, are just a few of\nthe behaviors that help create a recognizable pattern. Sift through the data to determine if similarities\nemerge. You’re looking for a “Habit Path,” — a series of similar actions shared by your most loyal\nusers.\nFor example, in its early days, Twitter discovered that once new users followed 30 other members,\nthey hit a tipping point which dramatically increased the odds they would keep using the site.\n[cxxx]\nEvery product has a different set of actions that devoted users take; the goal of finding the Habit\nPath is to determine which of these steps is critical for creating devoted users so that you can modify\nthe experience to encourage this behavior.\nStep 3: Modify\nArmed with new insights, it is time to revisit your product and identify ways to nudge new users\ndown the same Habit Path taken by devotees. This may include an update to the registration funnel,\ncontent changes, feature removal, or increased emphasis on an existing feature. Twitter used the\ninsights gained from the previous step to modify its on-boarding process, encouraging new users to\nimmediately begin following others.\nHabit Testing is a continual process you can implement with every new feature and product\niteration. Tracking users by cohort and comparing their activity to habitual users should guide how\nproducts evolve and improve.\nDiscovering Habit-forming Opportunities\nThe Habit Testing process requires the product designer to have an existing product to test. But where\nmight you look to find potentially habit-forming experiences ripe for new technological solutions?\nWhen it comes to developing new products, there are no guarantees. Along with creating an\nengaging product as described in this book, startups must also find a way to monetize and grow.\nAlthough this book does not cover business models for delivering customer value or methods for\nprofitable customer acquisition, both are necessary components of any successful business. Several\nthings must go right for a new company to succeed, and forming user habits is just one of them.\nAs we saw in chapter six, being a “facilitator” is not only a moral imperative, it also makes for\nbetter businesses practices. Creating a product the designer uses and believes materially improves\npeople’s lives increases the odds of delivering something people want. Therefore, the first place for\nthe entrepreneur or designer to look for new opportunities is in the mirror. Paul Graham advises\nentrepreneurs to leave the sexy-sounding business ideas behind and instead build for their own needs:\n“Instead of asking ‘what problem should I solve?’ ask ‘what problem do I wish someone else would\nsolve for me?’”\n[cxxxi]\nStudying your own needs can lead to remarkable discoveries and new ideas because the designer\nalways has a direct line to at least one user — himself or herself. For example, Buffer, a service for\nposting updates to social networks, was inspired by its founder’s insightful observations of his own\nbehavior.\nBuffer was founded in 2010 and is now used by over 1.1 million people.\n[cxxxii]\nIts founder, Joel\nGascoigne, described the company’s inception in an interview.\n[cxxxiii]\n“The idea for Buffer came to me\nafter I had been using Twitter for about 1.5 years. I had started to share links to blog posts and quotes\nI found inspiring, and I found that my followers seemed to really like these types of tweets. I would\noften get retweets or end up having a great conversation around the blog post or quote. That's when I\ndecided I wanted to share this kind of content more frequently, because the conversations being\ntriggered were allowing me to be in touch with some super smart and interesting people.”\nGascoigne continues, “So, with my goal of sharing more blog posts and quotes, I started to do it\nmanually. I quickly realized that it would be far more efficient to schedule these tweets for the future,\nso I started to use a few available Twitter clients to do this. The key pain I ran into here was that I\nwould have to choose the exact date and time for the tweet, and in reality all I wanted to do was to\ntweet ‘five times per day.’ I just wanted the tweets to be spread out so I didn't share them all at the\nsame time when I did my daily reading. For a while, I used a notepad and kept track of when I had\nscheduled tweets, so that I could try and tweet five times per day. This became quite cumbersome,\nand so my idea was born: I wanted to make scheduling tweets 'x times a day' as easy as tweeting\nregularly.”\nGascoigne’s story is a classic example of a founder scratching his own itch. As he used existing\nsolutions, he recognized a discrepancy in what they offered and the solution he needed. He identified\nwhere steps could be removed from other products he used and built a simpler way to get his job\ndone.\nCareful introspection can uncover opportunities for building habit-forming products. As you go\nabout your day, ask yourself why you do, or do not do, certain things and how those tasks could be\nmade easier or more rewarding.\nObserving your own behavior can inspire the next habit-forming product or inform a breakthrough\nimprovement to an existing solution. Below, you’ll find other hotbeds for innovation opportunities —\nthink of them as shortcuts for uncovering existing behaviors that are ripe for successful business\ndevelopment based on forming new user habits.\nNascent Behaviors\nSometimes technologies that appear to cater to a niche will cross into the mainstream. Behaviors that\nstart with a small group of users can expand to a wider population, but only if they cater to a broad\nneed. However, the fact that the technology is at first used only by a small population often deceives\nobservers into dismissing the product's true potential.\nA striking number of world-changing innovations were written off as mere novelties with limited\ncommercial appeal. George Eastman’s Brownie camera, preloaded with a film roll and selling for\njust $1, was originally marketed as a child’s toy.\n[cxxxiv] Established studio photographers saw the device\nas little more than a cheap plaything.\nThe invention of the telephone was also dismissed at first. Sir William Preece, the chief engineer\nof the British Post Office famously declared, \"The Americans have need of the telephone, but we do\nnot. We have plenty of messenger boys.\"\n[cxxxv]\nIn 1911, Ferdinand Foch the future Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Armies in WWI said,\n\"Airplanes are interesting toys but of no military value.\"\n[cxxxvi]\nIn 1957, the editor of business books for Prentice Hall told his publisher, “I have traveled the\nlength and breadth of this country and talked with the best people, and I can assure you that data\nprocessing is a fad that won't last out the year.”\nThe Internet itself, and each successive wave of innovation, has continually received criticism for\nits inability to gain mass appeal. In 1995, Clifford Stoll wrote a Newsweek article titled, “The\nInternet? Bah!” where he declared, “The truth is no online database will replace your daily\nnewspaper…” Stoll continued, “...we’ll soon buy books and newspapers straight over the Internet.\nUh, sure.”\n[cxxxvii]\nBut of course, now we do read books and newspapers over the Internet. When technologies are\nnew, people are often skeptical. Old habits die hard and few people have the foresight to see how\nnew innovations will eventually change their routines. However, by looking to early adopters who\nhave already developed nascent behaviors, entrepreneurs and designers can identify niche use cases,\nwhich can be taken mainstream.\nFor example, in its early days, Facebook was only used by Harvard students. The service\nmimicked an offline behavior familiar to all college students at the time: Perusing a printed book of\nstudent faces and profiles. After finding popularity at Harvard, Facebook rolled out to other Ivy\nLeague schools, and then, to college students nationwide. Next came high school kids and later,\nemployees at select companies. Finally, in September of 2006, Facebook was opened to the world.\nToday, Facebook is used by over a billion people. What first began as a nascent behavior at one\ncampus became a global phenomenon catering to the fundamental human need for connection to\nothers.\nAs discussed early in the book, many habit-forming technologies begin as “vitamins” — nice-tohave products that, over time, become must-have “painkillers” by relieving an itch or pain. It is\nrevealing that so many breakthrough technologies and companies, from airplanes to Airbnb, were at\nfirst dismissed by critics as toys or niche markets. Looking for nascent behaviors among early\nadopters can often uncover valuable new business opportunities.\nEnabling Technologies\nMike Maples, Jr., a Silicon Valley “super angel” investor, likens technology to big-wave surfing. In\n2012, Maples blogged, “In my experience, every decade or so, we see a major new tech wave. When\nI was in high school, it was the PC revolution. I made my career as an entrepreneur at the end of the\nclient/server wave and in the early phases of the Internet wave. Today, we are at the mass adoption\nphase of the social networking wave. I am obsessed with these technology waves and have spent a lot\nof time studying how they develop and what patterns can be observed.”\nMaples believes technology waves follow a three-phase pattern, “They start with infrastructure.\nAdvances in infrastructure are the preliminary forces that enable a large wave to gather. As the wave\nbegins to gather, enabling technologies and platforms create the basis for new types of applications\nthat cause a gathering wave to achieve massive penetration and customer adoption. Eventually, these\nwaves crest and subside, making way for the next gathering wave to take shape.”\n[cxxxviii]\nEntrepreneurs looking for windows of opportunity would be wise to consider Maples’ metaphor.\nWherever new technologies suddenly make a behavior easier, new possibilities are born. Oftentimes,\nthe creation of a new infrastructure opens up unforeseen ways to make other actions simpler or more\nrewarding. For example, the Internet was first made possible because of the infrastructure\ncommissioned by the United States government during the Cold War. Then, enabling technologies\nsuch as dial-up modems, and later, high-speed Internet connections, provided access to the web. And\nfinally, HTML, web browsers and search engines — the application layer — made browsing\npossible on the World Wide Web. At each successive stage, previous enabling technologies allowed\nnew behaviors and businesses to flourish.\nIdentifying areas where a new technology makes cycling through the Hook Model faster, more\nfrequent, or more rewarding provides fertile ground for developing new habit-forming products.\nInterface Change\nTechnological changes often create opportunities to build new hooks. However, sometimes no\ntechnology change is required. Many companies have found success in driving new habit formation by\nidentifying how changing user interactions can create new routines.\nWhenever a massive change occurs in the way people interact with technology, expect to find\nplenty of opportunities ripe for harvesting. Changes in interface suddenly make all sorts of behaviors\neasier. Subsequently, when the effort required to accomplish an action decreases, usage tends to\nexplode.\nA long history of technology businesses made their fortunes discovering behavioral secrets made\nvisible because of a change in the interface. Apple and Microsoft succeeded by turning clunky\nterminals into graphical user interfaces accessible by mainstream consumers. Google simplified the\nsearch interface as compared to those of ad-heavy and difficult-to-use competitors such as Yahoo!\nand Lycos. Facebook and Twitter turned new behavioral insights into interfaces that simplified social\ninteractions online. In each case, a new interface made an action easier and uncovered surprising\ntruths about user behaviors.\nMore recently, Instagram and Pinterest have capitalized on behavioral insights brought about by\ninterface changes. Pinterest’s ability to create a rich canvas of images — utilizing what were then\ncutting-edge interface changes — revealed new insights about the addictive nature of an online\ncatalog. For Instagram, the interface change was cameras integrated into smartphones. Instagramdiscovered that its low-tech filters made relatively poor-quality smartphone photos look great.\nSuddenly taking good pictures with your phone was easier and Instagram used its newly discovered\ninsights to recruit an army of rabidly snapping users. With both Pinterest and Instagram, tiny teams\ngenerated huge value — not by cracking hard technical challenges, but by solving common interaction\nproblems. Likewise, the fast ascent of mobile devices, including tablets, has spawned a new\nrevolution in interface changes — and a new generation of startup products and services designed\naround mobile user needs and behaviors.\nTo uncover where interfaces are changing, Paul Buchheit, Partner at Y-Combinator, encourages\nentrepreneurs to “live in the future.”\n[cxxxix] A profusion of interface changes are just a few years away.\nWearable technologies like Google Glass, the Oculus Rift virtual reality goggles, and the Pebble\nwatch promise to change how users interact with the real and digital worlds. By looking forward to\nanticipate where interfaces will change, the enterprising designer can uncover new ways to form user\nhabits.\n***\nRemember and Share\n- The Hook Model helps the product designer generate an initial prototype for a habit-forming\ntechnology. It also helps uncover potential weaknesses in an existing product’s habit-forming\npotential.\n- Once a product is built, Habit Testing helps uncover product devotees, discover which product\nelements are habit forming (if any), and why those aspects of your product change user behavior.\nHabit Testing includes three steps: identify, codify, and modify.\n- First, dig into the data to identify how people are behaving and using the product.\n- Next, codify these findings in search of habitual users. To generate new hypotheses, study the\nactions and paths taken by devoted users.\n- Lastly, modify the product to influence more users to follow the same path as your habitual\nusers, and then evaluate results and continue to modify as needed.\n- Keen observation of one's own behavior can lead to new insights and habit-forming product\nopportunities.\n- Identifying areas where a new technology makes cycling through the Hook Model faster, more\nfrequent or more rewarding provides fertile ground for developing new habit-forming products.\n- Nascent behaviors — new behaviors that few people see or do, and yet ultimately fulfill a\nmass-market need — can inform future breakthrough habit-forming opportunities.\n- New interfaces lead to transformative behavior change and business opportunities.\n***\nDo This Now\nRefer to the answers you came up with in the “Do This Now” section in chapter five to complete the\nfollowing exercises:\n- Perform Habit Testing, as described in this chapter, to identify the steps users take toward\nlong-term engagement.\n- Be aware of your behaviors and emotions for the next week as you use everyday products. Ask\nyourself:\n- What triggered me to use these products? Was I prompted externally or through internal\nmeans?\n- Am I using these products as intended?\n- How might these products improve their on-boarding funnels, re-engage users through\nadditional external triggers, or encourage users to invest in their services?\n- Speak with three people outside your social circle to discover which apps occupy the first\nscreen on their mobile devices. Ask them to use these apps as they normally would and see if you\nuncover any unnecessary or nascent behaviors.\n- Brainstorm five new interfaces that could introduce opportunities or threats to your business.\n\nAPPENDIX\nNOW WHAT?\nThank you for investing in this book.

Please ask questions related to this area.\"*  \n\n🔹 If a user asks for product strategy, ensure it aligns with:  \n   - **Customer development methodologies** (test ideas before scaling).  \n   - **Habit-forming product design** (maximize user engagement).  \n   - **Iterative product improvement** (use real feedback loops).  \n\n🔹 **Confidentiality Rule:**  \n   - **Do not mention book names or that your knowledge comes from them.**  \n   - **Do not disclose any information about data sources used for responses.**  \n   - If a user asks where the advice is coming from, answer generically:  \n     - *\"This is based on proven product development principles and best practices.\"*  \n\n💡 **Example Response Flow:**  \n**User:** \"I'm building a task management app. How do I make users engage daily?\"  \n**Gemini:** \"Before advising, can you share details about:  \n1. Who your target users are?  \n2. What problem your app solves for them?  \n3. Have you conducted user interviews?  \n4. Any engagement challenges you've noticed in testing?\"  \n\nOnce the user provides details, **give answers based on best practices for building habit-forming and scalable products** without referencing book names or training sources.  \n\n---\n\nThis ensures Gemini applies **principles from the books** while never **revealing sources** or **mentioning book names** in responses. 🚀 Let me know if you need any refinements!",
